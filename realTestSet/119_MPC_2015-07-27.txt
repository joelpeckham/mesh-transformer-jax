The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n11 photos Low oil prices haven\u2019t hurt U.S. refiners, which have benefited from access to cheaper crude. On the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, the top four energy performers over the past four years have been downstream companies: Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO), Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO), Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX), according to data from Bloomberg . Both Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 were the downstream arms spun off from their parents in 2011 \u2014 Houston-based Marathon Oil Corp. (NYSE: MRO) and Houston-based ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP). Both of the downstream companies have surged from the access to the plethora of production coming from U.S. shale plays. However, a ramp-up in refinery projects in Latin America, where about half of U.S. fuel exports are shipped, might stall exports. That is not stopping some refiners from betting on the Gulf Coast, which hosts five of the largest U.S. refineries. In June, New Jersey-based PBF Energy Inc. said it would buy a Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery for $322 million from Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) and PDV in its Gulf Coast debut. \u2014 Emily Wilkinson Texas Gulf Coast rules refining in the U.S. The Texas Gulf Coast is the largest refining district in the U.S. In 2014, the region accounted for 25 percent of national operable refining capacity and produced 26 percent of the nation\u2019s refined petroleum products, according to the Energy Information Administration.
