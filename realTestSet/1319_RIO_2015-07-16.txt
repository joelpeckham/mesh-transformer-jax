It is now tracking around the US$50.00 a tonne mark. \nThe iron ore price had already been declining in recent months, exacerbated by the world's four biggest iron ore exporters -- Rio, BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) , Vale and Fortescue -- lifting their production levels to maintain their share of exports. \nElsewhere, Rio said hard coking coal production was up five percent to 2.1 million tonnes in the quarter from the previous three months, while semi-soft coking and thermal coal production was down 10 percent to 5.1 million tonnes. \nBauxite production rose two percent to almost 10.7 million tonnes, while copper production dropped seven percent to 134 thousand tonnes due to lower production from its Kennecott mine in Utah.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Rio Tinto Plc was 24.78615379333496 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Rio Tinto Plc was ",
