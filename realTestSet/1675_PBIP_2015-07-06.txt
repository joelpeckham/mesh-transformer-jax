Prudential Ghana, its first insurance business in Africa, has already nearly tripled its number of agents, signed a distribution agreement with Societe Generale and launched the unique Hospital Cash and Farewell plans. \nMatt Lilley, Africa CEO, Prudential said the company wants to become Africa\u2019s leading life insurer. \n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is an important step toward achieving that ambitious vision. Our talented Ghanaian team have shown over the past year how much we can achieve with the right people, investment and support. We look forward to working with our new Ugandan team, and colleagues across Prudential Africa, to build on this success and bring the benefits of life insurance to more customers across Africa\u201d, he said \nEmmanuel Aryee, CEO, Prudential Ghana, said the acquisition is a reflection of Prudential\u2019s long-term commitment to investing in Africa. \n\u201cWith its growing regional presence, Prudential is establishing a firm foothold to provide long-term finance for sustainable development in the continent, as it has done elsewhere in the world. Prudential Ghana benefits enormously from sharing expertise with colleagues across the global business, helping us to develop innovative products and services, increase customer satisfaction, and move closer to our goal of becoming the life insurer of choice for Ghanaians\u201d, he said.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Prudential Bancorp, Inc. of Pennsylvania was 12.374324798583984 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Prudential Bancorp, Inc. of Pennsylvania was ",
