In this part, we\u2019ll explore the 2Q15 financial performance of Ford\u2019s North America operations. \nWhile Ford gained market share in the global markets, its market share in North America came down in 2Q15. Lower market share in North America was largely due to fewer sales of the F-150. Record earnings \nFord\u2019s North American operations posted pre-tax profits of ~$2.6 billion in 2Q15, as you can see in the chart above. This is the highest-ever profit that Ford has posted in North America. The North American automobile industry has shown strength for the last several quarters. Tesla (TSLA) gets most of its revenues from North America. \nFord\u2019s North American operations have been profitable since 2010. Strong performance in North America has helped Ford weather challenges in other markets, including South America and Europe. We\u2019ll discuss Ford\u2019s performance in Europe in the next parts of this series. \nGeneral Motors\u2019 (GM) North American operations also posted a record adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $2.8 billion in 2Q15 at a margin of 10.5%. A higher market share of trucks and crossovers boosted GM\u2019s 2Q15 profit margins. More to come for Ford? \nFord expects its performance in North America to further improve in the second half of 2015. The F-150, which has historically been a key driver of Ford\u2019s profits, didn\u2019t contribute much to its 2Q15 profits. According to Ford, the company ramped up production levels for the F-150 towards the end of the quarter. This should translate into higher sales in the coming quarters. \nCurrently, Ford forms 2.49% of the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLY) and 0.55% of the iShares Russel 1000 Value ETF (IWD). \nIn the next part of this series, we\u2019ll talk about the 2Q15 performance of Ford\u2019s South America operations.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc was 601.6487426757812 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc was ",
