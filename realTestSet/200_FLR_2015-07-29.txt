A veteran of the firm since September 2011, Kershaw will be stepping down from his position in favor of a newcomer after a term of about four years. He will stick around for at least a few weeks before retiring \"to assist in the transition of responsibilities to his successor.\" \nTaking his place will be Gary Smalley, a new hire plucked from Fluor Corporation. Currently a corporate controller, Smalley will jump ship for Tutor and take his new title \"no later than\" Sept. 1st, ending a 24-year career with Fluor in the process. Commenting on the new hire, Tutor Perini Chairman and CEO Ronald Tutor said, \"We are pleased to welcome Gary to our executive management team and look forward to working with him to continue driving the Company's growth.\" \nPresumably, Ronald Tutor was referring to top line growth, as the company's stock price has been doing anything but growing. \nThe trouble with Tutor Over the past year, Tutor Perini shares are down a whopping 30%. Why? Despite growing revenues consistently over the past several years, the company has struggled to keep profits growing in tandem. In 2010, the company reported net income of $104 million. Four years later, 2014 results showed earnings were essentially flat at $108 million. \nWorsening matters further, a significant writedown to goodwill in 2012 (not long after Kershaw joined the company) pushed Tutor Perini into a $265 million loss that year -- eating up more than two-thirds of the profits it has earned over the past five years. \nLong story short, the company is long overdue for a change in top management. Hopefully, Smalley will measure up to the task. \nThis $19 trillion industry could destroy the Internet One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed -- and if you act soon, it could make you rich.
