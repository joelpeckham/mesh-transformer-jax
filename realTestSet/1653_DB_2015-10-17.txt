That is why it must reform. The UK needs to pursue a global agenda - and the issue is whether it is able to do that in a reformed EU or whether it needs to pursue that approach outside.\" \nMr Lyons comments follow a report backed by the Mayor last year that showed the City of London (LSE: CIN.L - news ) would continue to thrive outside the 28-nation bloc . \nLondon's value to the UK economy - currently \u00a3350bn - would rise to \u00a3640bn by 2034 if Britain stayed in a reformed EU and adopted policies encouraging more trade with fast-growing markets, the report showed. \nBut if the UK left the EU but continued to pursue its own trade-friendly, London would still grow to \u00a3615bn over the next two decades, it found. \nDavid Cameron has outlined four key demands to keep Britain within the bloc , including a \u201cred card\u201d system to bring powers back from Brussels and fresh safeguards for the City. \nThe Prime Minister has pledged to deliver a written list of his renegotiation demands within weeks .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 28.44559669494629 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
