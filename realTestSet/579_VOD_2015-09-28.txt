But Spain's constitution does not allow any region to break away, so the prospect remains hypothetical. \nEuropean stock markets have steadily lost ground from peaks reached in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) , partly due to concerns about an economic slowdown in China. \nData on Monday showed that profits earned by Chinese industrial companies declined 8.8 percent in August from a year ago. \n\"Overall sentiment remains negative for now while there is much talk about a squeeze on earnings and lower economic growth in the months ahead,\" said Peregrine & Black senior sales trader Markus Huber. \nVOLKSWAGEN SHARES FALL \nVolkswagen shares were among the worst performers in Europe, falling 3 percent after two German newspapers reported on Sunday that Volkswagen's own staff and one of its suppliers warned years ago about software designed to thwart emissions tests. \nVW shares have fallen by more than 30 percent over the last week after the German company acknowledged installing software in diesel engines designed to hide their emissions of toxic gasses. \nVodafone also fell 3.9 percent after the British mobile operator said it had ended talks with Liberty Global about an exchange of assets. \nHowever, there were signs elsewhere that merger activity remained alive, with SAB Miller shares rising 4.1 percent after the Sunday Times newspaper reported that Anheuser-Busch InBev SA could bid about $106 billion for SABMiller (Xetra: BRW1.DE - news ) within days. \n\"We don't think that merger and acquisition activity will be derailed by the market volatility,\" said Edouard Petitcollot, senior fund manager at Candriam Investors Group. \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Toby Chopra)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Vodafone Group Plc was 22.507631301879883 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Vodafone Group Plc was ",
