The June report of the Credit Managers\u2019 Index (CMI) from the National Association of Credit Management (NACM) fell back to 53.4, mirroring the slide found from February to March. The ongoing inconsistency makes the CMI, among other economic data, most resemble a seesaw, according to NACM Economist Chris Kuehl, Ph.D.\u201cEvery month, analysts await new set of data releases poised to make some declarative statement regarding where the economy is heading\u2014every month, the clear path proves to be elusive once again,\u201d said NACM Economist Chris Kuehl, Ph.D. \u201cThere always seems to be something both optimists and pessimists can latch on to.\u201dThe month-to-month changes are not the only \u201ctale of two directions,\u201d as Kuehl characterizes it. There are increasingly wide spreads between the favorable factors and the unfavorable factors within both the manufacturing and service sectors. \u201cOn the one hand, there is some hope for better numbers in the future as the favorables look better than in a long while,\u201d Kuehl said. \u201cHowever, the present is not so positive, as the unfavorables are worsening, which signals that many companies are not in the shape they would like to be and are falling behind in their obligations.\u201dWith the combined index sales category at its lowest in more than a year and unfavorable categories accounts placed for collection and dollar amount of customer deductions falling dramatically, into contraction territory, there is reason to be concerned that the performance of mid-2014 won\u2019t be matched in short order.\u201cThe year-over-year trend is not encouraging,\u201d Kuehl said. \u201cThere has been a distinct downward slide, and it is apparent that conditions were far better in mid-2014 than they are now. That was neither expected nor wanted at this stage of a recovery.\u201dFor a full breakdown of the manufacturing and service sector data and graphics, view the complete June 2015 report at http://web.nacm.org/CMI/PDF/CMIcurrent.pdf .
