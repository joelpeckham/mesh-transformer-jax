The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple profit jumps, shares slip \n  11:57 a.m. \n(Getty Images) \nApple says its quarterly profit leapt 38 percent to US$10.7 billion (NZ$16.14 billion) on surging iPhone sales, but fell short of analysts' expectations. \nApple shares fell sharply in after hours trading on Tuesday (local time). \n\"We had an amazing quarter,\" chief executive Tim Cook insisted, noting that iPhone revenue in the quarter that ended on June 27 was up 59 percent from the same period a year earlier. \nAnalysts had expected Apple to sell even more iPhones and were looking for a brighter forecast than was given for the current quarter. \nApple shares dropped more than six per cent to US$121.94 in after-market trades that followed release of the earnings figures. \nSales of iPhones have been powering Apple profits, and any hint of a plateau spooks investors. \nApple sold 47.5 million iPhones in the quarter, with sales up 85 percent in Greater China where the company's overall revenue more that doubled to US$13 billion, according to chief financial officer Luca Maestri. \nApple did not detail specifics on sales of its newly-launched smartwatch, instead folding the figure into an \"other\" category that rose 49 percent to US$2.64 billion \nCook said during an earnings call that sales of iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Macintosh computers \"topped internal expectations\". \nNearly three months after the launch of Apple's fashionably smart wrist wear, some analysts say it's not a mainstream hit. \nBut others see promise in its popularity with internet-savvy younger people. \nA recent study by research firm Slice Intelligence suggested that, based on a large sampling of email receipts in the United States, orders for Apple Watch have plunged 90 percent since the week that the wearable computing gadget made its debut. \nThe estimate did not factor in data about Apple Watch sales at real-world stores. \nHowever, Cantor Fitzgerald experts believe Apple Watch will be a \"go-to gift\" during the year-end holiday season and become the best selling new product in Apple's history. \nApple Watch was the first new product line introduced by the culture-changing company behind iPhone, iPad, iPod and Macintosh computers since 2010. \nGlobal Equities Research managing director Trip Chowdhry has estimated Apple could sell 20 million to 25 million of the watches in the final three months of this year. \nAFP\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 29.835147857666016 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
