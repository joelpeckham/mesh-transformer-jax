MUMBAI: Bain Capital is set to exit Hero MotoCorp by selling its remaining stake in the Indian two-wheeler maker, two people familiar with the matter said. The transaction, along with two previous deals, will give the US private-equity firm a twofold return on an investment made a little over four years ago. Bain Capital, which manages $70 billion of assets, still holds a 1.49 per cent stake, or 29 lakh shares, in Hero MotoCorp after already selling a majority of the 8.6 per cent stake it bought in 2011 for $550 million (Rs 2,500 crore at the then exchange rate). It made about Rs 3,980 crore from the two previous transactions and the third is expected to bring proceeds of nearly Rs 800 crore based on the stock's current market price. Besides, Bain Capital has earned Rs 320 crore in dividends since 2011. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, Hero MotoCorp ended Tuesday at Rs 2,624.25, down 2.73 per cent from the previous day, compared with a 0.41 per cent drop in the benchmark Sensex. Citigroup has the mandate to find buyers through block trades on the stock exchanges, sources said. The transaction is likely to have a price band that could stretch up to a 5 per cent discount to the closing share price on the day the term sheet is released, they added. The PE firm first sold a 2.84 per cent stake in the company in June 2014, earning Rs 1,481 crore, while the second tranche in November brought Rs 2,500 crore for a 4.27 per cent stake. Along with the expected proceeds from the third round and dividends so far, its returns from the investment will be about Rs 5,100 crore. The Boston-based PE firm invested in Hero MotoCorp along with Lathe Investment, a unit of Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, to help the Munjal family buy out Honda Motor's 26 per cent stake in the company. The Munjals acquired the 26 per cent held by Honda in the joint venture through their private holding arm Hero Investments, financed through a loan, and then sold a minority stake in Hero Investments to Bain Capital and GIC to retire the debt. Hero Investments was merged with the listed Hero MotoCorp last year, giving direct equity stake in it to the two investors and allowing them to exit the company as any public shareholder.  \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Honda Motor Company, Ltd. was 34.630001068115234 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Honda Motor Company, Ltd. was ",
