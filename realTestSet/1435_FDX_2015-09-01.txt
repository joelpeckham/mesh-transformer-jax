The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCrude Oil Prices Soar, Erasing 5 Weeks of Losses in Just 5 Days Speculative Positioning Data Hints Rebound Likely Corrective Crude oil prices continue to push higher as expected after taking out resistance capping gains and guiding the trend lower since late June. The aggressive upward push has brought prices to level unseen in a month, erasing in five weeks of losses in just five days of gains. Looking ahead, near-term resistance is now at 55.90, the 50% Fibonacci retracement, with a break above that on a daily closing basis exposing the 61.8% level at 59.13. Alternatively, a move back below the 38.2% Fib at 52.67 opens the door for a challenge of the 23.6% retracement at 48.67. While the move higher is enjoying strong momentum, lasting follow-through seems questionable. The latest edition of the CFTC\u2019s Commitment of Traders report shows last week\u2019s pickup in net-long positioning came primarily from the unwinding of shorts rather than new buying interest. This paints current gains as corrective in the context of a longer-term descent rather than a sustained bullish trend change.
