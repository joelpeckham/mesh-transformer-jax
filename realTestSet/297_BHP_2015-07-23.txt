Rig terminations will mean further losses to underlying attributable profit of up to $100 million. \nOnly at an oil price of $60 per barrel and a gas price of $3.00 per million British thermal units (mbtu) can BHP's onshore operations be cash flow positive in the 2016 financial year, according to the company. \nHenry Hub gas (GT-HH-IDX) stood at $2.88 per mbtu on Wednesday, while oil hovered around $50.16 per barrel. \nCopper is also problematic. \nAfter a 14 percent drop in selling prices in fiscal 2015, BHP on Wednesday disclosed it will book up to $650 million in impairments, while another $382 million will be cut from earnings before interest and tax due to the repricing of 350,000 tonnes of copper sold the previous year on a provisional basis. \nCopper is selling for around $2.47 a pound, not far off a six-year low, while BHP's output will also fall next year due to lower grades at its Escondida mine in Chile. \nIron ore is still the flagship and BHP is showing no signs of rethinking a gameplan to take annual production close to 300 million tonnes annually from 254 million in fiscal 2015. \nThe extra cargoes and a drive to further lower costs will help offset a decline in the iron ore price, which Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain forecasts will hit $45 a tonne by December. BHP realised an average price of $61 a tonne in fiscal 2015, down from $103 a year earlier. \nBHP beefed up its metallurgical coal output by 13 percent in hopes of mitigating a 20 percent fall in price, only slightly less painful than the 22 percent price fall in thermal coal. \nA potential \"fifth\" pillar, potash, will meet a world awash in the fertiliser if BHP enters the market by developing its Jansen mine in Canada. \nBHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie pointed in the company's half-year production report to lower costs and significant cuts in capital spending. \n\"We remain confident that our focus on best-in-class performance together with our unrivalled asset quality, optimal diversification and continued investment in high-return projects, will create long-term value through the cycle and deliver superior returns to our shareholders,\" he said.
