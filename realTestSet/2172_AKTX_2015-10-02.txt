The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPrint \n  Spain's gross domestic product will grow fast enough over the coming years to begin stabilising the stock of government debt, so long as the recovery in the labour market continues and deflation risks are kept at bay, Standard&Poor's said. The announcement will be welcomed by the central government in Madrid, which has come under fire from the opposition due to the rise in public debt despite the improvement in the economy. \nNominal GDP will expand at a rate of about 4% over the next few years, whereas the Spanish Treasury refinances central government and regional debt at an average cost of less than 1%. \nAs a consequence, the ratings agency lifted its rating on the Kingdom of Spain\u00b4s long-term sovereign debt by one notch to BBB+ from BBB beforehand. \nS&P said the economy had benefitted from two rounds of labour-market reforms since 2010, which had improved the competitiveness of the export and services sector and from easier financial conditions. \nBy the end of 2015 exports will represent approximately 34% of Spain\u00b4s GDP versus 25% in 2008. \nReal GDP growth was forecast at an average of 2.7% over 2015-2017 with the debt to GDP ratio expected to peak in 2015 at 98.4%.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was 22.239999771118164 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was ",
