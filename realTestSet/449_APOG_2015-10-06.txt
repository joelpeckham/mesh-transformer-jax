O3b\u2019s first year anniversary achievements include: Initial constellation capacity of 192 Gbps 40 customers in service 31 countries with live customers Already, the capacity that O3b has sold is equivalent to nearly 10% of the contracted capacity of the three largest Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) operators combined. O3b Networks operates a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellite constellation, which at 8000 km, is much closer to the earth than traditional geostationary (GEO) satellites. The lower altitude greatly reduces latency, decreasing response times and improving voice and video quality as well as enabling an array of cloud services. O3b satellites achieve extremely high throughput, making its satellite service an ideal solution when fiber is impractical or unreliable.
