Yet according to the 7,016 IT and cyber security professionals globally who responded to a parallel survey, only 22 percent feel this same confidence about controlling who has access to information collected by IoT devices in their homes, and 72 percent say manufacturers are not implementing sufficient security in IoT devices. Indian consumers say the average number of IoT devices in their home is seven. Smart TVs, smart watches and connected home alarm systems are the most wanted IoT devices to get in the next 12 months. Hidden Internet of Things ISACA\u2019s survey of IT and cybersecurity professionals globally depicts an IoT that flies below the radar of many IT organizations \u2013 an invisible risk that is underestimated and under-secured: 73 percent estimate the likelihood of an organization, being hacked through an IoT device is medium or high 63 percent think that the increasing use of IoT devices in the workplace has decreased employee privacy 50 percent say their organization\u2019s BYOD (bring your own device) policy does not address wearable tech \u201cIn the hidden Internet of Things, what is also invisible are the countless entry points that cyber attackers can use to access personal information and corporate data,\u201d said Christos Dimitriadis, International President, ISACA . \u201cThe rapid spread of connected devices is outpacing an organization\u2019s ability to manage and safeguard company and employee data.\u201d According to the cybersecurity and IT professionals surveyed, device manufacturers are falling short. Seventy two percent say they do not believe that manufacturers are implementing sufficient security measures in IoT devices. \u201cAs the usage of IoT devices increases in India, it is important that device manufacturers adopt an industry-wide security standard that addresses IoT security. They need to install rigorous security governance and professional development for their cybersecurity employees. This move will further boost the acceptance of IoT in the country, as research shows there is a direct relation between positive customer sentiment and companies that can demonstrate credentials,\u201d said Avinash Kadam, Advisor \u2013 ISACA India Cybersecurity Initiative .
