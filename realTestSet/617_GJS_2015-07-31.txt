The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCNBC.com SHARES <p>Energy firms hike productivity but cut jobs </p> <p>Michele Della Vigna, head of European energy research at Goldman Sachs, talks about the volatility in oil prices and how energy firms are cutting costs.</p> \nThe price of oil could be stuck firmly at around $50 a barrel by 2020, a Goldman Sachs analyst told CNBC, raising new fears about the energy companies that have already started to cut costs, projects and jobs to cope with falling revenues. \nSeveral big oil and gas companies announced this week they intend to make cutbacks to stay afloat in this sinking environment. Royal Dutch Shell expects to cut 6,500 jobs, 6,000 for Centrica , and at Chevron , a 2 percent slash to its global workforce. \nThese measures were introduced while Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude are trading around $53 and $48 a barrel respectively as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has kept its supply high \u2013 and process low \u2013 in its battle for market dominance over U.S. shale oil. \nRead More Chevron earnings miss expectations \nBut Michele Della Vigna, co-head of European equity research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC Friday that by 2020, they see oil around $50 per barrel. \n\"What we've learned from this reporting season is that deflation is accelerating from a cost perspective. Efficiency is improving in all the mature regions and productivity is sharply improving in almost all the shale places in the U.S.\" \n\"With all of that compounds to what we think will be a multi (year) deflationary trend in oil. If we look to the end of the decade, we see oil at $50, as this productivity continues and as costs keep coming down.\" \nGoldman Sachs' estimate conflicts with World Bank 's latest commodity price forecast, who forecast crude oil to be at $57.50 per barrel on average this year, and $71.90 by 2020. A time to buy? <p>Put money on oil: Horwitz </p> <p>Todd Horwitz, author & founder at Averagejoeoptions.com, explains why oil prices will stabilize and why it&#039;s a good investment opportunity.</p> \nHowever, this isn't a time to get despondent. Roberto Cominotto, Investment Manager at GAM said in a note, that the energy sector still can provide attractive investment opportunities, despite the low oil price environment. \n\"The energy sector (still) provides attractive investment opportunities, even with oil prices significantly below 100 USD. These can be found primarily in mid and small cap producers, which have the lowest production costs in the sector.\" \nCominotto gave U.S. shale oil and gas producers as an example, like Cardinal Energy or Torc Oil & Gas as these firms can grow even at this current level. \nTodd Horwitz, author & founder at Averagejoeoptions.com, also seemed optimistic on the energy sector, telling CNBC Friday, that he would put money on the sector, during its most \"stressed times.\" \n\"We know that oil can go a bit lower, that's there's trouble with the dollar, there's worldwide manipulation with the currencies, but here's a level \u2013 you've got stocks like Haliburton down around 40 \u2013 you've got a lot of good opportunity here, that if you're investing these are opportunities to buy into these markets because these companies are strong and will improve with stronger prices.\" Outlook for shale?

He went on to say this will result in services costs reducing and countries become more competitive, fuelling this \"deflationary spiral.\" Alexandra Gibbs News Assistant, CNBC.com Related Securities\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Goldman Sachs Group Securities STRATS Trust for Goldman Sachs Group Securities, Series 2006-2 was 16.018877029418945 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Goldman Sachs Group Securities STRATS Trust for Goldman Sachs Group Securities, Series 2006-2 was ",
