Avis Budget Group Inc. - Earnings Surprise | FindTheBest Results benefited from an increase in organic volumes, continuous improvement in margins, and contributions from acquisitions, partly offset by lower pricing.However, shares of the company dropped nearly 3% in the after-market trading session as its net revenue slipped 1% year over year to $2,173 million and also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,263.7 million.

Segment Performance Americas , which consists of the company\u2019s operations in North America, South America, Central America and Caribbean, reported revenue growth of 1% year over year to $1,556 million, driven by 3% volume expansion and 3% improvement in ancillary revenue per rental day.

Adjusted EBITDA grew 3% to $178 million on account of higher volume coupled with better fleet utilization, somewhat negated by lower pricing.The International segment\u2019s revenues came in at $617 million, down 5% from the year-ago quarter, largely impacted by negative currency movements.
