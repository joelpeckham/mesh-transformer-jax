The answer can be yes. Sometimes. Like all of us, college students could use a good boost to their credit scores and some reward points, but they have to be careful. College is expensive enough without adding 20% APR to the picture. \nFor college students, building a solid credit score is a huge challenge. No credit can create almost as many problems as bad credit when it comes time to get a car loan or starter house, and it can even challenge students who need to take out private loans for school. \nGraduates without credit, \u201cghosts\u201d in the language of the banking industry , have one leg up on their classmates though: they won\u2019t be paying for that junior year bar tab until age 28. Credit cards are one of the easiest ways to build a credit history, but in the wrong hands they can range from troublesome to absolutely disastrous. \nStill, smart students can get a lot of value out of a good credit card. Bills and fixed expenses like textbooks, which a student would otherwise buy with cash, can be put on a decent card and then paid off right away. It\u2019s a great way to develop history and build a relationship with companies that will make you eligible for more glamorous rewards cards down the future.
