That threshold has triggered regulatory alarm bells in past mergers in Denmark, Germany, Austria and Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) . \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was better placed than the EU enforcer to scrutinise Hutchison's bid to create the biggest mobile operator in Britain by merging its Three UK unit with O2. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is appropriate for the case to be referred to the CMA for investigation because any impact on competition resulting from the merger will likely be limited to UK consumers,\" the UK agency said on its website. \nIt said this would also be more efficient as it is also investigating BT's $20 billion offer to buy mobile operator EE from Orange (Taiwan OTC: 4554.TWO - news ) and Deutsche Telekom (Xetra: 555750 - news ) . \nCommission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso confirmed the CMA's request, saying the Commission will assess it. It has until Oct. 30 to do so. The EU regulator has rejected similar requests from national agencies in previous telecoms deals. \nHutchison is ready to sell network capacity and frequencies to fend off antitrust concerns, sources told Reuters last month. \n($1 = 0.6580 pounds) (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Elaine Hardcastle)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 25.50295066833496 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
