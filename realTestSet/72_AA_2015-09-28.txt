It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) will have a workforce of some 17,000. \nThe downstream manufacturing unit, to be named after the separation, will aim at fast-growing markets such as the aerospace industry, supplying rolled and engineering products for aircraft and jet engine manufacturing. The company will operate in 157 locations globally with 43,000 employees. \nThe plan, approved by the board of directors, is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2016, Alcoa said. It said it was structured as a US tax-free transaction to Alcoa shareholders, who will own all outstanding shares of the two companies. \nKleinfeld will lead the downstream manufacturing company as chairman and CEO, and serve as chairman for the upstream Alcoa for its initial phase. \nDemand for Alcoa manufactured products for airplanes and cars has been strong, but the company has been pummeled by lower aluminum prices. Aluminum prices have lost nearly 40 percent in the past four years, and 25 percent over the past 12 months. \nFor the second quarter, Alcoa reported a small rise in earnings to $140 million, weighed down by the fall in aluminum prices. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Alcoa jumped 4.3 percent at $9.46 in opening trade.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Alcoa Inc. was 21.375749588012695 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Alcoa Inc. was ",
