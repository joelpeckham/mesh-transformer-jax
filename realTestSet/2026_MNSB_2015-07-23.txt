The consent order , announced on the CFPB\u2019s website yesterday, includes $16 million in refunds to consumers as well as a $2.5 million penalty paid directly to the agency. \nApproximately 130,000 people will get some portion of their money back under this deal. \nAmong other illegal practices , regulators found that Discover Bank had been overstating the amount due on billing statements and misrepresented the interested paid on accounts. Discover required borrowers to submit additional paperwork, or else their statements would reflect $0.00 in interest paid, leading many borrowers to believe incorrectly that they didn\u2019t qualify for certain tax benefits such as the student loan tax deduction. \nThe bank also engaged in illegal debt collection practices, an issue that has plagued the student loan industry to an increasing degree over the last several years, including calling borrowers before 8 a.m. and after 9 p.m. Approximately 150,000 of these out-of-hours calls were placed.
