This system is now being simplified, preparing the bank further for privatisation. \nThere are still some negative factors dragging down RBS\u2019s financial results. \nIan Gordon, an Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) analyst, expects RBS to pay a further \u00a3600m in compensation for PPI and other misconduct, as well as \u00a3800m in restructuring costs in its third quarter results. \nThe bank is also awaiting a legal settlement for pre-crisis toxic loans sold in the US. This is expected to be in the region of $5bn (\u00a33.3bn) but could come in at as much as $10bn . The bank will be the last of 18 banks to end the dispute with the Federal Housing Finance Agency. If RBS does not agree a settlement, the case is expected to come to court next year. \nHowever, Bernstein maintains that a small dividend is likely in spite of a \u201cworst-case litigation outcome\u201d. \nAny settlement should also help the bank's share price, as it removes a cloud hanging over the stock.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was 1912.5 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was ",
