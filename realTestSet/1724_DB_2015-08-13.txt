Alexis Tsipras, Greek prime minister, expressed confidence that the deal would be completed. \nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the country\u2019s economy is expected to shrink 2.3% this year because of the recent months of turmoil and the cuts required by the bailout, the officials said, citing the latest estimates from the institutions that have been negotiating Greece\u2019s new aid program. Next year, it is projected to contract 1.3%. Only in 2017 is the economy predicted to return to growth, expanding an expected 2.7% that year and 3.1% in 2018. \nThe Greek parliament is due to meet today and vote on the country's third bailout deal, reached with creditors after marathon talks on Tuesday. Apart from the Greek parliament, the new deal has to be agreed by Eurozone members. \nThe 29-page agreement gives the bailout institutions \u2014 the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund \u2014 sweeping control of large areas of Greek policymaking. It says: \u201cThe [Greek] government commits to consult and agree with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund on all actions relevant for the achievement of the objectives of the memorandum of understanding before these are finalised and legally adopted.\u201d See here . \nHowever, the Financial Times reports that a German finance ministry paper conceded that \u201clarge parts\u201d of the reform programme agreed at a last ditch leaders' summit last month, were included in the outline deal, ranging from tax collection to competition in tourist property rentals. \nBut Germany says some measures are delayed until October or November and some others \u201care not yet specified\u201d. \"Berlin is particularly concerned about a proposed delay in establishing a planned \u20ac50bn privatisation fund, which is due to take control of Greek state assets.\" \n\u201cDespite the obstacles and trip-ups that some are attempting to put in our path, I am optimistic that we will reach an agreement that will bring an end to economic uncertainty,\u201d Alexis Tsipras said on Wednesday. \nThe three-year programme entails a \u201cfiscal adjustment\u201d of up to 5% of Greek GDP, and there is a target of a primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, of 0.25% of GDP this year. Without the new measures, Greece would have had a primary deficit of 1.5% of GDP this year, the document says. By 2016, Greece would be expected to meet a primary-surplus target of 0.5%, followed by a 1.75% primary surplus in 2017. From 2018 onward, the agreement calls for the government to produce a 3.5% primary surplus every year. \nRelated Articles\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 31.619041442871094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
