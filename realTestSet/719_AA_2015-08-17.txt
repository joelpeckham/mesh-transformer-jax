Magazine , Quick Bridge Funding \nQuick Bridge Funding announced it ranked No. 5 on the Inc. magazine exclusive 2015 list of America\u2019s Fastest-Growing Private Companies \u2013 the Inc. 500. Quick Bridge Funding achieved its rank by attaining a three-year growth rate of 24,138 percent with 2014 revenue at $44.6 million. In addition, Quick Bridge Funding placed No. 2 out of the 247 other top financial services firms on the Inc. 5000 list.

According to Inc., firms must be U.S.-based and privately owned to qualify for inclusion. Revenue requirements for the newly released ranking were at least $100,000 in 2011 and at least $2 million last year. According to Leigh Buchanan, Editor-at-large, Inc. magazine, this year's Inc. 500 achieved a median growth rate of 1,772 percent and collectively created 57,822 jobs. Buchanan added most of the founders with companies on this list had the right idea at the right time. President Ben Gold shared that timing was indeed a key factor when Quick Bridge was founded in 2011. After the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d there was a strong demand for an alternative to using commercial banks for short-term working capital loans. The firm\u2019s niche focuses on $5,000 to $200,000 loans with terms averaging four to 10 months. By identifying this need early on, the founders pooled their extensive experience in equipment leasing with a trusted network of professional sales partners to create an ideal lending business model for business owners who may not qualify for a traditional loan or need the funds more quickly than banks can provide. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be in the top 5 of the Inc. 500,\u201d said Vice President Jason Osiecki. \u201cOur team at Quick Bridge works with enthusiasm to provide smooth, consistent and timely processing of our loan products. Each is keenly focused on improving and optimizing our trusted partners\u2019 and customers\u2019 experience. Whether a business needs cash to purchase inventory, increase cash flow, support expansion, bridge seasonality, or purchase another business, our working capital program is designed to help a business grow. We look forward to continuing to be an innovative leader in the alternative lending space.\u201d When asked why Quick Bridge Funding has experienced its exponential growth, Gold said, \u201cA combination of well-versed business-to-business lending experience and strong capitalization has helped us grow fast, but not too fast. Early on we built out our C-suite with 20+ year finance industry experts. We set up processes and systems that specifically focus on user experience for both our broker partners and the business owner end-user. What continues to set us apart from other alternative lenders is how transparent our process is and how easy it is to work with us. Achieving the No. 5 position on the Inc. 500 is a distinct honor, but more importantly, it is an inspiration to drive further excellence throughout every aspect of our business.\u201d Today's Other News\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Alcoa Inc. was 22.177045822143555 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Alcoa Inc. was ",
