It is set to begin the testing phase in 2016 and start operations in 2018. \nLevy put China's racing ahead to be first with an EPR reactor down to differences in nuclear security regulations as well as building and labour practices. \nChina, which started construction in 2009, has also \"greatly benefitted from the experience at Flamanville\", which has allowed it \"to avoid some of the glitches,\" said Xavier Ursat, director of engineering and new nuclear projects at EDF. \nFlamanville was originally set for delivery in 2012 at a budget of 3.3 billion euros. The latest setback leaves the estimated cost at \n10.5 billion euros. \n\"The cost of the first model is always higher,\" said Levy. \nHe also stressed that EDF and Areva remain confident of the reactor, which is \"vital\" for France's electricity network and can help the renewal of the country's vast nuclear energy sector. \nFrance is the most nuclear-dependent country in the world, and the second-biggest producer of nuclear energy with 58 reactors located in 19 power stations. \nThe delay and increased cost overruns sent EDF shares tumbling 2.24 percent Thursday to close at 18.290 euros on the Paris bourse.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of EPR Properties was 36.16312789916992 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of EPR Properties was ",
