RBS is expected to appeal the decision. \nIt comes at a critical time for RBS. Chancellor George Osborne announced last month that he plans to start selling off the UK government\u2019s stake later this year. \nThe bank also hopes to return to profit in 2016 for the first time since its \u00a346bn bailout in 2008. It announced a \u00a33.5bn annual loss for last year. \nRBS has already taken a \u00a3400m hit for PPI compensation, \u00a3430m for US fines related to foreign exchange rigging , and another \u00a3444m of conduct and litigation charges in the fourth quarter of last year. \nRBS declined to comment.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was 1777.5 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was ",
