Or, seen another way, that it showed \"some\" improvement. \nIn a note following the report, Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna pointed out that the only one of Yellen's preferred labor market metrics that did not improve was long-term unemployment as a percentage of total unemployment, which climbed to 26.4%. \nBut this is a nitpicky detail, and on balance, most economists found the jobs report boring because there was no element of surprise. \nThe report was not bad enough to derail the Fed's and markets' expectations for a rate hike this year, and it was not stellar enough to lock in a September rate hike. \n(Deutsche Bank) For the markets part, the swaps market had priced in a 47% chance of a hike in September before the jobs report. Following Friday's number, this had climbed to as high as 52% according to Reuters . \nAnd so more than ever in recent months, there's a convergence between the Fed's criteria to raise rates, the economic data, and the market's expectations. \nThere are, however, still have a couple of critical checkpoints to reach before the Fed's next meeting. \nRetail sales numbers, housing market indicators, and the second estimate of second-quarter Gross Domestic Product are due later in August. \nAnd of course, there's still one more jobs report due out on September 4. \nBut for now, the labor market has Wall Street more convinced that the Fed can move in September. \nCiti's Steve Englander had said before the report that payrolls growth above 200,000 was enough for the Fed to move next month. \nIn a note to clients after the jobs report, Englander said, \" Overall, Fed officials are probably saying a prayer of thanks that today\u2019s data look like an accurate reflection of the state of the economy, rather than some data aberration, and are consistent with the signals they have been sending.\" \nIn other words, the Fed has exactly it wants.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was 155.22470092773438 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was ",
