Boeing CEO sees scope for additional 737 work in China Sep. 22, 2015, 1:42 PM 0 \nThomson Reuters Boeing Vice Chairman and President Muilenburg speaks during the last day of the Reuters Aerospace and Defense Summit in Washington \nBy Alwyn Scott \nSEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Tuesday he sees scope for additional 737 work going to China as the company continues to increase production rates of the single-aisle jetliner. \n\"As we ramp up capabilities in China, including additional 737-related work, the actions that we'll take are actions that will also allow us to grow jobs here in the U.S.,\" he said at an aerospace conference in Seattle organized by SAE International. \nMuilenburg, who became CEO on July 1, stopped short of discussing specifics of Boeing's proposed 737 finishing facility in China, a step expected to be announced during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Seattle this week. \nBoeing's plan to set up a facility in China that would paint, finish and deliver 737 jetliners built at its factory near Seattle has provoked its largest union, representing about 35,000 Boeing employees. The International Association of Machinists said Boeing has discussed its desire to expand collaboration with China but shared no details. \"Any shift of aerospace jobs from our bargaining unit or Washington State causes grave concern,\" the union has said. \nMuilenburg said Boeing has had operations in China for 42 years and is continuing to invest to expand its capabilities there. Boeing is investing \"in a way that allows us to grow jobs around the world,\" he said, in response to a question. \"I think it's really important that as we think about that collaboration that it's seen as one that is beneficial to both countries.\" \nIn his prepared remarks, Muilenburg called Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc and Google Inc \"nontraditional\" aerospace and defense competitors for their efforts in space, satellites and drones. \nBoeing already has partnered with Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to build a manned space vehicle capable of reaching the International Space Station. Boeing is working on other partnerships, Muilenburg said. \n\"We see emerging competitors and collaborators,\" he said, and \"need to be adept\" at partnering with them. \nBoeing, he said, \"cannot compete unless we have a global-scale, global diversification strategy, a strategy that accounts for collaboration in all parts of the world ... We must continue to expand in that direction.\" \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by James Dalgleish) Read the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2015. Follow Reuters on Twitter .
