The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHT Correspondent, Hindustan Times , New Delhi | Updated: Jul 30, 2015 17:34 IST According to Moody's report, India\u2019s political infighting is denting business confidence and without a majority in the Upper House, the ruling BJP\u2019s power has been \u201cnullified\u201d and the opposition has blocked proposed reforms. (AFP Photo) \nIndia\u2019s economic prospects face new hurdles amid falling investments, and medium and long term growth would suffer without sufficient and quick reforms, the analytics arm of global credit rating agency Moody\u2019s said in a report on Thursday. \nThe report raised fresh questions on the state of RBI, which is in the midst of a controversial overhaul on the governor\u2019s powers in managing interest rates, saying any tampering with the central bank\u2019s autonomy may hurt India\u2019s credibility. \n\u201cThe government\u2019s failure to deliver promised reforms is the major impediment,\u201d Moody's Analytics said in a latest report \u201cIndia Outlook: Waiting for Reforms to Fuel Growth.\u201d \n\u201cKey reforms such as the land acquisition bill, flexible labour laws, and the goods and services tax have failed to pass in the Parliament. And given the political seesaw, these are unlikely to be delivered until later this year or even 2016,\u201d Faraz Syed, associate economist, Moody\u2019s Analytics, said in the report. \nCritical reforms measures such as the Goods and the Services Tax (GST) and the land acquisition bill have remained stuck because of the Parliamentary logjam. \nThe Moody\u2019s Analytics report termed these as \u201cempty promises\u201d mirroring the views of restive investors who want speedier reforms and easier rules to do business in India, which is set to become the world\u2019s fastest growing major economy. \nThe commentary marks a turnabout of India\u2019s image after the Narendra Modi-led BJP rode to a landslide poll victory last year promising to usher in \u201cacchen din\u201d drumming up expectations of investor-friendly measures. \nIndia\u2019s political infighting is denting business confidence, it said adding that without a majority in the Upper House, the ruling BJP\u2019s power has been \u201cnullified\u201d and the opposition has blocked proposed reforms. \nMoody\u2019s Analytics, a division of Moody's Corporation, said that investment rates in India have fallen amid stalled infrastructure projects and mounting bad loans. \n\u201cA positive step higher is not likely without significant reform,\u201d it said. \nIndia\u2019s ability rival neighbouring titan China would critically depend on the pace of important reforms such as the land acquisition bill that is a catalyst to investment, it said. \n\u201cPassing the bill will improve India\u2019s business environment by speeding up the conversion of land for infrastructure use. Foreign firms are wary of investing in India, as lengthy delays in acquiring land tend to stall projects,\u201d it said. \nIt forecast that India\u2019s GDP will grow at 7.6% in 2015, but said that any expansion below 10% will be below potential given India\u2019s new controversial formula to calculate national income. India\u2019s GDP grew 7.3% in 2014-15. \n\u201cThere are signs that all is not well for manufacturing, the key industry touted by the BJP to drive India\u2019s growth engine,\u201d it said. \nMoody\u2019s Analytics warned against going ahead with the proposal to remove the RBI governor\u2019s veto power under a proposed new monetary policy committee to decide on interest rates. \nThe government has proposed a seven-member monetary policy committee, including four members picked by the government, to vote on interest rate decisions. It would also remove the governor\u2019s veto power. \nIt said that a government-elected panel undermines the RBI\u2019s independence. Moving to the new model would severely dent the RBI\u2019s competency. \n\u201cCredibility would be lower, politics would drive decisions, and transparency would be reduced. \nOverall, we believe that tampering with the central bank\u2019s independence would make it difficult to anchor inflation expectations. This would weigh on India\u2019s economic prospects, particularly financial market stability. But given the criticism of the draft bill, it is unlikely to pass Parliament,\u201d it said.
