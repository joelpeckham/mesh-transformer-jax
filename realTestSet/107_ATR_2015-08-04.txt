The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPrint Related Content San Francisco, California, Aug. 4, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Acetic Acid Market is expected to reach USD 13.31 billion by 2022, according to a new study by Grand View Research, Inc. Increasing consumption of PTA for manufacturing polyester coupled with rising application scope of polyester in the textile industry is likely to fuel acetic acid market growth over the next seven years. Growing demand for VAM which is used as a precursor for manufacturing EVA and EVAc coupled with an increasing consumption of these downstream chemicals in the formulation of solvents and adhesives is expected to drive acetic acid market. Acetic acid is also used as a key ingredient in vinegar. Rising demand for vinegar owing to numerous health benefits associated with it is expected to augment market growth over the forecast period. \nAcetic acid demand for manufacturing VAM exceeded 3,600 kilo tons in 2014 and the segment is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 4% from 2015 to 2022. Vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) is used in production of various adhesives and water based paints. Rising demand for industrial coatings and paints on account of growing infrastructure, specifically in emerging economies including China, Brazil and India, is a key factor for the growth of (VAM) over the forecast period. \nBrowse to access In-depth research report on Global Acetic Acid Market with detailed charts and figures: http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/acetic-acid-market \nFurther key findings from the study suggest: China was the largest market for acetic acid in 2014 alone accounting for over 40% of the global volume demand.
