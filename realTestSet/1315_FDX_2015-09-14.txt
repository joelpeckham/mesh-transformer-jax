It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) had risen to a high of 1,414.99 points earlier in the session. \n\"Investors are pretty nervous ahead of the Fed meeting this week as they are quite uncertain about the central bank's likely move on interest rates. We are seeing a lot of volatility in the market because liquidity is very low,\" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels. \nThe FTSEurofirst 300's volumes were just 30 percent of its 90-day daily average after a half-day trading. \nTraders said volumes were likely to remain low before the Fed's two-day meeting ends on Sept. 17. Markets are still guessing whether the central bank will raise rates or wait for December or early next year. \nMining shares came under further pressure, tracking a sharp decline in prices of key industrial metals. Copper prices fell 1.2 percent, alongside Chinese equities, after data showed a lower-than-expected rise in China's factory output, reinforcing worries about demand for the metal. \nThe STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources index was down 0.7 percent, dragged down by a 3.9 percent drop in Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) and a 1.2 percent weaker Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) . \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) rose 1.7 percent, with traders saying that the company was benefiting from an upbeat article by Barron's on Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) , which uses ARM designs in its products. \nOn the broader STOXX 600 index, the biggest rise came from Television Francaise. Its shares rose 7.6 percent and were poised for their best day in more than a year after the French government decided against allowing advertising on public broadcasters. \nThe market had little reaction to data showing that the euro zone's industrial production was stronger than expected in July, thanks to a higher volume of energy, capital and durable consumer goods. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was 140.67230224609375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was ",
