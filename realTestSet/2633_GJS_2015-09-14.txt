But my guess is that the ruling could pressure Yahoo! to put itself up for sale, as CEO Marissa Mayer is under renewed demands to perform after years of poor acquisitions and weak core-operation results. \nAs a result, I plan to add to my Yahoo! long at under $30/share. I'll also have more to say about YHOO in the coming days.
