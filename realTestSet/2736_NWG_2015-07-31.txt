NatWest, RBS In Online Banking Problems By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News \u2013 4 minutes 51 seconds ago View Photo \n\nRBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) is investigating a fault with its online banking system, amid customers reporting they were unable to access their accounts. \nThe bank's helpline on Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) received dozens of messages from customers unable to log-in for online banking and the bank's mobile app earlier today. \nMany of those complaining said they are due to be paid, with one saying she was overdrawn three days after payday but couldn't access online banking. \nThe bank responded on Twitter: \"Please try not to panic\". \nRBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers were affected by the problem, which lasted around 50 minutes. \nIt is not the first time the banking group has had IT problems. \nLast year it was fined \u00a356m by regulators after up to 6.5m customers from NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank were prevented from accessing their accounts in 2012. \nCustomers were unable to make payments for up to three weeks, in a problem blamed on a botched software upgrade. \nIn June, around 600,000 transactions, including salaries and benefits, were also affected by IT problems at the bank. \nJust after 1.30pm, an RBS spokesman told Sky News: \"We are aware that some customers experienced issues with online banking this morning. \n\"This has now been resolved and our service is operating as normal. \n\"We apologise to those customers who experienced difficulties.\" \nRBS chief executive Ross McEwan spoke to Sky News on Thursday about the bank's IT glitches, saying: \"Any drop-off in systems is totally unacceptable for us and we are under more spotlight than anybody else so the bar is higher because of our past history. \n\"But we've spent \u00a3750m rebuilding a lot of the capability and resistance in our systems and I\u2019m far more confident as CEO that we\u2019ve got really good systems that perform well.\"\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of NatWest Group plc was 8.552071571350098 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of NatWest Group plc was ",
