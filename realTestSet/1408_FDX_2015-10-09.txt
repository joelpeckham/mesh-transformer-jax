The contract rose $1.72 to close at $53.05 a barrel on Thursday. \nU.S. crude was 12 cents higher at $49.55 a barrel, after rising 3.4 percent to close at $49.43 a barrel. \nU.S. crude is heading for a gain of nearly 9 percent this week, the biggest weekly increase since August. \nPIRA Energy Group, a closely watched forecaster that predicted the slump in oil prices a year ago, said on Thursday it expects crude prices to rise to $70 per barrel by the end of 2016 and $75 a barrel in 2017. \nAlso supporting prices was the release of the Fed minutes, which showed that policymakers are concerned that the global economic slowdown may affect the outlook for the U.S. \nThis led investors to further pare bets that the Fed is likely to raise rates later rather than sooner. \nGains in Chinese equities on Thursday, opening after a week long National Day holiday, added to the bullish tone, while Russia's military involvement in Syria has brought a geopolitical risk premium into the market. \n(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Richard Pullin; Editing by Richard Pullin)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was 144.83436584472656 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was ",
