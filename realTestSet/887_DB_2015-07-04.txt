It's too much money and I don't believe Europe could allow it,\" he told Spanish newspaper El Mundo . \"What they're doing with Greece has a name: terrorism. What Brussels and the troika want today is for the 'yes' [vote] to win so they could humiliate the Greeks.\" \nYanis Varoufakis, Greece's finance minister \nMr Varoufakis also dismissed as \"malicious\" reports that the Greek government was preparing to raid bank accounts to shore up its finances. \nIt came as Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany's finance minister, suggested that Greece could temporarily exit the eurozone. \"Greece is a member of the eurozone. There's no doubt about that. Whether with the euro or temporarily without it: only the Greeks can answer this question.\" \nHe told Bild newspaper that Europe stood ready to help Greece in the event of a humanitarian crisis. \"It is clear that we will not leave the people in the lurch,\" he said. Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, added that Brussels was ready to extend emergency loans to Greece to prevent vital public services from collapse. \nHowever, Mr Schulz said a \"no\" vote could trigger a meltdown in the country . \"Without new money, salaries cannot be paid out, the health care system does not work, power supplies and public transport will fail and essential goods cannot be imported because they cannot pay [for them].\" \nLouka Katseli, chairman of the National Bank (NYSE: NBHC - news ) of Greece, said on Friday that Greek banks would only have \"adequate\" liquidity until the end of Monday night. \nEd Miliband, the former Labour leader, also weighed into the debate. He tweeted that the eurozone was in \"denial\" about the need to restructure Greece's \u20ac330bn debt pile and accused creditors of trying to \"bully\" the country into submission. \nGlobal stock markets are braced for another tumultuous period after a week in which equity and other markets were rocked by the events in Brussels and Athens. \nFollowing Greece's failure to pay the \u20ac1.6bn owed to the International Monetary Fund last Tuesday, investors anxiously await the outcome of today's referendum. \nAn initial result is expected around 7pm BST. European markets face grave vulnerabilities, entering potentially uncharted territory when they open for trading tomorrow morning. \nThe Greek debt crisis has reinjected volatility into equity markets. On Friday the VSTOXX, a closely watched gauge of European stock market volatility, hit its highest level since last October's torrid worldwide market sell-off.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 30.31119728088379 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
