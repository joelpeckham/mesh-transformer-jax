And the expectation is for continued pain due to sagging net interest margins, or the spread between what a bank pays to borrow money and what it can charge on loans. \n\"It will be a difficult quarter,\" said Erik Oja, banking analyst with S&P Capital IQ. \nIndeed, Wall Street analysts are predicting lower earnings for the three months ended in June compared to last year's second quarter for several of the big banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, according to FactSet, a financial data tracker. Analysts also expect depressed revenue overall compared to last year's second quarter, FactSet data shows. \nLast quarter, the banks proved they could offset the pain of historically low interest rates with strong growth in fees earned from mergers and other advisory work \u2014 as well as stellar trading profits at places like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. \nStrong deal activity over the last three months suggests there could be room for another upside surprise, according to data from Dealogic, which tracks mergers and acquisitions. \nGlobally, $1.4 trillion in deals were announced in the second quarter, up from $918 billion in the first-quarter and $1 trillion this time last year, data from Dealogic shows. In the U.S. the trend was similar with $660 billion worth of deals announced last quarter, up from $447 billion in the same period last year. Merger boom lifts banks despite loan troubles \nWall Street often looks to investment bank Jefferies as a predictor of how the largest banks might fare in areas like investment banking and trading. This quarter, however, Jefferies' strong stock trading results, up 29%, may not be the best indicator because the firm missed the volatility that whacked stocks in June amid concerns about Greece breaking away from the European Union, experts said. \nThe return to choppy markets in June \"isn't good news for the trading desks,\" noted KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. \nHere's a closer look at expectations for the banks' results for the three-month period ended in June: \n*JP Morgan will report Tuesday before the opening bell. Analysts expect second-quarter earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $24.44 billion, according to FactSet. That's down from last year when the bank reported second-quarter EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $24.45 billion. \n*Wells Fargo will also report Tuesday before the opening bell. Analysts expect second-quarter earnings per share of $1.03 a share on revenue of $21.71 billion, according to FactSet. That's up from last year when Wells reported second-quarter EPS of $1.01 a share on revenue of $21.06 billion. \n*Bank of America reports Wednesday before the opening bell. Analysts expect second-quarter earnings per share of $0.36 a share on revenue of $21.39 billion, according to FactSet. Last year BofA reported EPS of $0.19 on revenue of $21.74 billion. \n*Goldman Sachs reports Thursday before the opening bell. Analysts expect second-quarter earnings per share of $3.85 a share on revenue of $8.74 billion, according to FactSet. That's down from last year when Goldman reported EPS of $4.10 a share on revenue of $9.12 billion. \n*Citigroup reports Thursday before the opening bell. Analysts expect second-quarter earnings per share of $1.34 a share on revenue of $19.17 billion, according to FactSet. Last year, Citi reported EPS of $1.24 a share on revenue of $19.34 billion. \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kaja Whitehouse on Twitter @kajawhitehouse 3 CONNECT 27 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1MpQZHh TOP VIDEOS\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank of America Corporation was 15.042933464050293 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank of America Corporation was ",
