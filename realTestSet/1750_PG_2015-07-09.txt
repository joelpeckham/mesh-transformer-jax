The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nP&G\u2019s $15B deal will affect thousands of workers Jul 9, 2015, 12:00pm EDT Updated Tom Uhlman About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter & Gamble, including 200 at its\u2026 more About 10,000 people will no longer have jobs with Procter & Gamble , including 200 at its Cincinnati headquarters or other local offices, after the consumer goods company sells CoverGirl cosmetics and 42 other beauty brands to Coty Inc. in a $15 billion deal. Those jobs are expected to transfer to New York-based Coty, whose current brands include Calvin Klein fragrances and Adidas deodorant. The transaction includes P&G\u2019s global salon professional hair care and color, retail hair color, cosmetics and fine fragrance businesses, along with select hair styling brands. \u201cThe merger with Coty, a strategic acquirer, will provide an excellent new home for these businesses and brands, as well as for the talented people who are operating them,\u201d said A.G. Lafley , CEO of P&G, in a statement released by the company. Related Content P&G reveals why women would rather skip breakfast than morning shower While Coty bid $12.5 billion for the P&G brands, the actual value depends largely on Coty\u2019s stock price. Based on Coty\u2019s current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion. Shares in Coty (NYSE: COTY) plunged more than 6.25 percent this morning, to $29.54, on news that a definitive agreement had been signed with P&G. However, the firm's shares have been on an uptick , ranging from $15.74 to $32.72 over the last 52 weeks. Shares in P&G (NYSE: PG) were up less than 1 percent this morning, to $81.32, over the previous close. The value of shares has ranged from $77.10 to $93.89 over the last 52 weeks. P&G has 118,000 employees worldwide, including about 11,000 in Greater Cincinnati, but both of those numbers were expected to drop even before the deal with Coty. About 2,700 people work for P&G\u2019s Duracell battery division, which P&G has agreed to sell to Berkshire Hathaway in a deal that is to close this year. Those workers, mostly based at Duracell headquarters in Bethel, Conn., and offices in Geneva, Switzerland and Panama, are expected to transfer to Berkshire Hathaway . Separately, P&G expected to trim its office workforce by about 10,000 employees by last month to reduce costs. And I reported in April that P&G plans to eliminate up to 6,000 additional non-manufacturing jobs by June 2017 through buyouts, retirements and not filling vacant positions. That means P&G would likely have less than 100,000 employees by the time the Coty deal closes, which is expected in the second half of 2016 depending on regulatory approval. P&G expects to finalize details of the Coty deal in the coming months, which could involve a split-off or spin-off transaction involving beauty brands such as Max Factor and Wella Professional. The company would prefer to do either a split-off or spin-off as a deal called a reverse Morris trust in which Procter & Gamble shareholders could exchange P&G shares for shares of Coty. P&G shareholders would have the option of exchanging all, some or none of their P&G shares. A reverse Morris trust allows a big corporation such as P&G to unload unwanted assets without paying taxes on gains. Shareholders who participate in such deals also can avoid taxes on capital gains while diversifying their holdings. Such schemes are unusual because the company that buys the brand has to be smaller than the asset it acquires. Coty is reportedly worth $12 billion including debt and equity. By comparison, P&G has a market capitalization of about $220.7 billion based on current trading value. The transaction will result in a one-time earnings gain that P&G expects to range from $5 billion to $7 billion, depending on the final value of the deal at closing. P&G hopes to pay dividends and retire shares worth up to $70 billion over a four-year period from fiscal years 2016-19 through a combination of shares eliminated via the deal with Coty and the sale of the $2 billion Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway, as well as ongoing share repurchases. \u201cThis represents a significant step forward in the work to focus our portfolio on 10 categories and 65 brands,\u201d Lafley said. \u201cWe have leading global brand positions in these categories, consumer preferred products and leading brands in the largest markets. These businesses and brands have historically grown faster and have been more profitable than the balance. We expect these 10 categories to grow and create value as we focus the energy and resources of the company exclusively on them.\u201d Market analysts welcomed news of the latest streamlining effort. Lafley had revealed in August of last year that he planned to cut about half of P&G\u2019s 160 or so brands over a two-year period to focus on top ones such as Tide detergent and Pampers diapers. The Coty deal \u201cis a large step in the right direction for the company and shareholders, but they can do more for sure, including perhaps even an actual breakup,\u201d said Ali Dibadj , a market analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., a sell-side research and brokerage firm in New York. \u201cThe timing is odd to us after weeks of silence from the company following media reports on such a deal,\u201d Dibadj told me. \u201cFeels a little amateurish in terms of process by P&G.\u201d The deal is positive news for shareholders, said Martha Strebinger , an investment specialist at Truepoint Wealth Counsel in Blue Ash. \u201cSales may dip in the short term from the loss of revenue of these brands, but long term I think this will benefit P&G shareholders as the company focuses on its core strengths,\u201d Strebinger told me. The brands that P&G will sell to Coty account for about $5.9 billion in sales, or about 30 percent of its $19.5 billion in total beauty segment sales for fiscal year 2014, which ended in June of that year. P&G has total annual sales of about $83 billion. P&G will retain big-name beauty brands such as Head & Shoulders and Pantene hair care products as well as Olay skin care. \u201cProcter & Gamble stands out as an attractive undervalued investment, and we\u2019d suggest long-term investors consider building a position in the name,\u201d Erin Lash , a senior equity analyst with Morningstar, wrote in a note today for the Chicago-based investment research firm. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t anticipate a material change to our $90 fair value estimate, which already took into account the planned brand sales announced last year.\u201d The beauty category \u201chas remained a challenge for P&G, as organic sales have stagnated over the past few years,\u201d Lash wrote. \u201cWe suspect the performance in this category could prove lumpy, given the fierce competitive dynamics of the U.S. hair care space, and it will take a few more quarters until we can get a sense whether this improvement is sustainable.\u201d The other brands included in P&G\u2019s deal with Coty are Sebastian Professional, Clairol Professional, Sassoon Professional, Nioxin, SP (System Professional), Koleston, Soft Color, Color Charm, Wellaton, Natural Instincts, Nice & Easy, VS Salonist, VS ProSeries Color, Londa/Kadus, Miss Clairol, L\u2019image, Bellady, Blondor, Welloxon, Shockwaves, New Wave, Design, Silvikrin, Wellaflex, Forte, Wella Styling, Wella Trend, Balsam Color, Hugo Boss, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Lacoste, Bruno Banani, Christina Aguilera, Escada, Gabriela Sabatini, James Bond 007, Mexx, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen.
