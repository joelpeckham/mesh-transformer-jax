The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDaniel Acker/Bloomberg A Wal-Mart employee is suing the retailer for having failed to provide benefits to her\u2026 more A Massachusetts woman sued Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in federal court today over the company's refusal to provide health insurance benefits to her spouse, who also is a woman. Jacqueline Cote of New Bedford is seeking class-action status for her complaint. She is being represented by the legal groups Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders and the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. Cote alleges that she repeatedly tried to obtain health insurance for her spouse, Diane Smithson , after the couple wed in Provincetown in 2004. Each time, Cote alleges, the Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) self-service enrollment system electronically blocked her from proceeding. She said she got no further when trying to enroll Smithson through traditional channels. Eventually unable to continue COBRA insurance after leaving her own Wal-Mart position, Smithson ran up around $150,000 in medical bills after developing ovarian cancer, the suit states. A spokesman for Wal-Mart, which began offering coverage to same-sex couples on Jan. 1, 2014, said in a prepared statement: \u201cWalmart expanded its benefits starting in January 2014 and currently covers same sex spouses and domestic partners. We have not yet seen the details of the lawsuit and out of respect for Ms. Cote we are not going to comment other than to say our benefits coverage previous to the 2014 update was consistent with the law.\u201d Cote wants financial compensation and assurances Wal-Mart won't ever revoke coverage for same-sex couples. She works at the Wal-Mart store in Swansea, Massachusetts. \nWant Boston Retailing & Restaurants news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
