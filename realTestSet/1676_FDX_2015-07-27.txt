 "context": "The following article called 'Is it last call for the Fed's record-low rates?' was published on 2015-07-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n\"news\" The job market's better health \nYellen said in a recent speech in Cleveland that signs of slack remain in the job market, despite the decline in the jobless rate. She also said \"some tentative hints of a pickup in the pace of wage gains may indicate that the objective of full employment is coming closer into view.\" \nThe healing seen in the job market seems to be flashing a green light to the Fed, according to Gus Faucher, senior economist with PNC Financial Services Group. \n\"The labor market is definitely moving in the right direction,\" he says. \"The latest FOMC minutes (from the June 16-17 meeting) say that 'many expected that labor market underutilization would be largely eliminated around year-end if economic activity strengthened as they expected.' So that certainly would point to a rate hike this year.\" Yellen's inflation problem \nAs for inflation, the Fed has wanted to see it strengthen to 2 percent. That goal has been elusive. \n\"Persistently low price inflation, which can tend to slow the pace of wage increases over time, can weaken the economy by, for example, making it more difficult for households and firms to pay off their debts,\" Yellen noted in her Cleveland speech. She added that the inflation-dampening impacts of falling crude oil prices and the appreciating dollar \"are expected to fall out of measures of inflation by early next year.\" \nDoes that mean the Fed would finally raise rates before the end of this year? \"I think if we see even modest inflation in the coming months, it would be sufficient to calm any fears among the committee members,\" says Curt Long, chief economist with the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. Greece crimps rate liftoff (or 'limp off') \nFears of a full-blown economic crisis related to a Greek exit from the eurozone have added to the Fed's caution, although that nightmare scenario seems less likely now. \n\"It is still a long way between now and September (when rates could rise), but a Greek deal clears away another potential hurdle to liftoff,\" says Mesirow Financial chief economist Diane Swonk. \"I think we should think of it as 'limp off,' given the pace of rate hikes will be gradual.\" \nLong points out that the Fed will be ready to respond if things become unwound between Greece and the European Union. \n\"Hypothetically, if events abroad (whether in Greece or elsewhere) were to deteriorate, the committee has shown that it does take financial markets into account when setting monetary policy,\" he says. China's markets in the red \nThe other potential problem economy is a big one: China. Its collapsing stock market bubble has commanded the world's attentions. \n\"Beijing's increasingly desperate but ineffective efforts to curb the collapse in share prices only add to the sense that China will likely surpass Greece as the major international concern by the time the next FOMC meeting comes around,\" says Snaith, the University of Central Florida economist. \nWhile Fed officials continue to cling to their monetary policy mantra of being \"data dependent,\" they also are hoping, just like the rest of us, that an international crisis won't develop. For the central bank, a crisis could further delay the return of interest rates back to more normal levels. advertisement\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was 152.547607421875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was ",
