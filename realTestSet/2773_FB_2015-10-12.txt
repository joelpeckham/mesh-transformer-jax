We continue to grow our business activities in the UK.\" \nThe company pointed out it was taxed on their profit figures, not the amount of revenue they generate in the UK, and argued that all of its UK staff paid tax on their income - including the money they received from the share bonus scheme. \nFacebook is the latest in a long line of multinational firms to be criticised over the size of their UK tax bills. \nGoogle (Xetra: A0B7FY - news ) , Starbucks (Swiss: SBUX.SW - news ) , Amazon and Vodafone have also come under fire in recent years. \nIn response, Chancellor George Osborne has pledged to crackdown on tax avoidance by large companies in the UK. \nIn March of this year, Mr Osborne announced he would be introducing a \u2018diverted profits tax\u2019, which would penalise companies that move their profits outside of the UK to countries with lower corporation tax rates in order to pay less to the Treasury. \nThe tax, nicknamed the \u2018Google Tax\u2019, came into effect in April (LSE: 0N69.L - news ) 2015. \nMr Osborne also said he would be changing the rules of corporation tax to prevent companies contriving losses. \nSpeaking at the time he said: \"Let the message go out - this country's tolerance for those who will not pay their fair share of taxes has come to an end.\"\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Facebook, Inc. was 93.23999786376953 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Facebook, Inc. was ",
