Analysts predict retail sales, including auto fuel, climbed 4.8% in June. \nOn a month-on-month basis, the forecast is for a 0.4% rise for in retail sales for both including and excluding auto fuel. The report is an important measure of consumer spending, contributing to gross domestic product growth. \nAny improvements are likely to fuel speculation of an earlier than estimated interest rate hike after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney last week indicated a possible increase later this year. \nMeanwhile, the US sees the release of weekly jobless claims data. The consensus forecast is for a slight dip to 280,000 in the week to 18 July from 281,000 the previous week. \nThe US Federal Reserve is keeping a close watch on the jobs market as it considers the timing of an interest rate hike. \nCompany-wise Unilever (NYSE: UL - news ) reports its second quarter interims.
