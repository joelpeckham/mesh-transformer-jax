It has failed to do so,\" said Jan Lynn Owen, commissioner of the California agency, in a separate statement. \n\"This new agreement holds Banamex appropriately accountable for its continued violations.\" \nThe move affects 300 workers in California and Texas. Banamex USA has assets just over $500 million and deposits of about $460 million, Citigroup said. \nCitigroup said it was focused on working with affected employees to locate jobs \"both inside and outside of Citi.\" \nCitigroup has faced a number of probes over Banamex after it announced a charge of about $235 million in February 2014 due to uncovering \"significant\" fraud on the books of oil contractor Oceanografia after having lent it $585 million through a Banamex unit.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Citigroup, Inc. was 52.19567108154297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Citigroup, Inc. was ",
