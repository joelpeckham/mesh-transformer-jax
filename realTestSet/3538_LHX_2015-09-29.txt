The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n. (NASDAQ: ARRS) will showcase a unique proof of concept for the Energy 2020 initiative at the SCTE Cable-Tec Expo on October 13-16 in New Orleans . The solution is based on ARRIS's popular E6000 CER platform and leverages standards-based SCTE APSIS MIBs along with patent-pending technology to reduce energy savings in the network by up to 15 percent. \nThe proof of concept allows the ARRIS E6000 CCAP to dynamically manage its power consumption\u2014capitalizing on the daily nature of high-speed data traffic to reduce energy use in response to monitored loads. ARRIS's demonstration at SCTE will highlight the solution's nearly 15-percent reduction of CCAP power consumption at a cable operator's headend facility during typical off-peak hours. \nARRIS is building on its legacy of conservation through innovation in customer premises equipment (CPE) by pioneering network-oriented power management solutions. Its proof of concept already achieves up to three-quarters of the Energy 2020 goal established by the SCTE in 2014, providing the industry with a foundation for reaching a 20-percent reduction in energy use the year 2020. \n'This proof of concept is the result of ARRIS's increasing investment in R&D. It showcases the network innovation that our industry needs to reduce energy consumption while addressing increasing demand for bandwidth,' said Tom Cloonan , CTO, Network Solutions, ARRIS. 'And it's just the beginning for ARRIS. As we continue to broaden our investments in R&D, we'll be fueling more innovation in Energy 2020 alongside our industry's other primary initiatives. We look forward to working with the SCTE to continue advancing Energy 2020 and to bring this concept to market.' \nTo learn more about ARRIS's CCAP proof of concept for the Energy 2020 initiative, visit ARRIS's Booth #551 at the SCTE Cable-Tec Expo. \nAbout ARRIS ARRIS Group , Inc.
