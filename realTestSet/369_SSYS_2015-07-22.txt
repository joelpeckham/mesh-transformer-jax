The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n21 photos Brooklyn-based Makerbot today hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony at its newest and biggest\u2026 more Makerbot today opened its largest factory in Industry City in Brooklyn, doubling the capacity of its previous plant. With the opening, the 3D-printing company addressed major concerns about a pending lawsuit and solidified Brooklyn as its long-term home. \u201cWe absolutely are committed here in Brooklyn to get the word out to the rest of the world,\u201d said Jonathan Jaglom , Makerbot's CEO, at the 41st Street location. \u201cWe are true partners to the Brooklyn cause. \u201c The new facility measures 170,000 square feet, which doubles production capacity compared to MakerBot's previous Brooklyn factory. The new layout is designed to streamline the production process advanced in accord with the \u201clean manufacturing\u201d method to maximize output and minimize waste. It includes a machine shop, and 3D-printing capabilities for manufacturing as well as research and development. The site employes about 140 people in production, shipping, receiving, manufacturing engineering, quality engineering, supply chain and planning. For now, it is only operating on one shift, leaving plenty of room to grow. Importantly, the site also includes an expanded space for product testing. Earlier this month, the company was sued on charges it knowingly sold defective extruders in its most recent model. Extruders are the last part through which the plastic filament passes before being placed on the model. During a tour after the ceremony today, we saw the facilities for new extruder testing, designed to address such concerns. Though such testing did occur at the previous location, it was nowhere near this scale, according to Scott Crouthamel , a site director. Forty four machines now test extruders for on average of 30 minutes before shipping. Makerbot was acquired by Minneapolis-based Stratasys (Nasdaq: SSYS) in June 2013 for $400 million. Last month, the company announced plans to move management operations of its Asia unit to a Stratasys office on location. But Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams , who cut the ribbon at today\u2019s ceremony, isn\u2019t worried that will be the case for these jobs. \u201cFor many years people in this city, instead of making screws, they felt like they were being screwed,\u201d said Adams on stage, holding a 3D-printed screw and bolt handed out to event attendees. \u201cNow we have an opportunity to make sure they can be a part of the great revolution that\u2019s happening here.\u201d Makerbot has sold about 80,000 machines to date, according to numbers shared by Jaglom. Though the company doesn't share the production output of the site, the plant manager, Diana Pinkus, said they are nowhere near capacity. This April, Makerbot let 20 percent of its staff, or about 100 people, go as part of a restructuring effort after closing its retail outlets in Manhattan, Boston and Greenwich, Conn. Though many of those jobs are still gone, Makerbot is currently hiring 40 people for the Brooklyn plant. \nWant New York Manufacturing news in your inbox?
