It's almost become the new normal. The reality is it isn't normal. \n\"If rates increase as inflation increases, a lot of people are in for a shock. \n\"Even if you're on a fixed-rate mortgage, when you come off that rate, the step from what you are used to to the new environment will be a shock.\" \nSimon Tyler, of broker Tyler Mortgage Management , said: \u201cWages have barely been rising for years but many people have stretched to get on the housing ladder, often only with the aid of government assistance. These people may find a rate hike hard to cope with.\"\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Moody's Corporation was 104.15086364746094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Moody's Corporation was ",
