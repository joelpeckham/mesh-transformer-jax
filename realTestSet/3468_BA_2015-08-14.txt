The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTushar Srivastava, Hindustan Times , New Delhi | Updated: Aug 14, 2015 11:57 IST \nBoeing has said it will do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to ensure that Ajay Singh-led SpiceJet places its next big order with the US aircraft manufacturer. \n\u201cWe will do everything it takes to keep them. We will see how it plays out...,\u201d Pratyush Kumar, president, Boeing India, told HT. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the prerogative of the customer what they do\u2026but he (Singh) should know that how loyal we have been to him,\u201d said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice-president, Boeing. \nKumar added that the non-availability of planes was a key reason why talks with Vistara could not proceed. \u201cAll slots are sold out, especially of the B737s. They wanted to start a new airline and were looking for availability in the time frame and we didn\u2019t have,\u201d he said. \nAs first reported by HT on July 29, SpiceJet is set to place an order for around 100 jets, worth about $11 billion at list prices. While the budget carrier operates a mixed fleet of Boeing 737s and Q400s, it has been a Boeing customer since its launch in 2005. SpiceJet has, however, stated that it is in talks with both Boeing and arch-rival Airbus for the mega aircraft order. \nWhile IndiGo and GoAir have an all-Airbus fleet, Jet Airways and Air India operate a mixed fleet. Both start-ups, Vistara and AirAsia India, have opted for Airbus. \u201cThis shows why SpiceJet is so important to Boeing,\u201d said aviation expert Rajji Rai.
