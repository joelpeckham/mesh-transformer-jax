 "context": "The following article called 'Advance Auto Parts (AAP) Q2 Earnings: A Surprise in Store? - Analyst Blog' was published on 2015-08-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nContent preferences Done Advance Auto Parts Inc. AAP is expected to report second-quarter 2015 results on Aug 13. In the last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.40%. Let\u2019s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors Influencing this Quarter Advance Auto Parts drives profits through its relentless focus on store expansion. During the 16-week period ended Apr 25, 2015, the company opened 25 stores. The rise in store count ensures higher availability of parts, thereby leading to higher sales. Advance Auto Parts is also poised to benefit from growing stability in the industry and an increasing average age of vehicles, along with a rise in the number of miles driven. The combination of a steadily improving job market and lower gasoline prices are also likely to boost the company\u2019s results.However, price competition poses a serious threat to Advance Auto Parts as it competes with national and regional automotive retailers. Moreover, the improvement in the quality of new vehicles leads to reduced need for the maintenance and repair of parts. This, in turn, hampers demand in the automotive maintenance market. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Advance Auto Parts is likely to beat earnings this quarter.
