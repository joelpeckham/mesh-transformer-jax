The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFont size Email Print \nWal-Mart said sales will be \u201crelatively flat\u201d in the current year \nWal-Mart has said it will add capabilities to its supply chain in a bid to be more efficient as the US retail giant cut its profit forecast for the next fiscal year. \nSpeaking at the group's investor day yesterday (15 October), CFO Charles Holley said he expects earnings to fall 6% to 12% in the year ending January 2017, as a result of investments in low prices and rising worker wages. \nIn August, Wal-Mart had lowered its EPS forecast for fiscal 2016, saying it expects earnings of between $4.40 and $4.70 per share, down from a previous forecast of $4.70 to $5.05 per share. \nThe company said it expects net sales to grow 3% to 4% annually over the next three years, but added that they will be \u201crelatively flat\u201d in the current year as a result of currency exchange. \n\u201cWe have experienced increasing sales momentum in our Wal-Mart US business and we continue to see improvement in our customer traffic,\u201d Holley told investors. \u201cHowever, the impact of currency on our total global growth has been much stronger than we anticipated a year ago.\u201d \nAddressing the firm's strategy for growth, CEO Doug McMillon said Wal-Mart will look at adding capabilities to its supply chain. \n\u201cIt has been one of our most important strengths and we are working to morph our supply chain of today to enable us to win in the future. Today most of our distribution centres were obviously built for the purpose of serving stores. We are changing that to have a stronger [each] capability for moving individual items.\u201d \nMcMillon said Wal-Mart will connect its various types of distribution centres and improve its inventory accuracy and efficiency. \n\u201cOptimising the inventory in our system is a huge lever to serve customers better and to take a lot of cost out, not only through transportation and handling but also through markdown elimination,\u201d he explained. \n\u201cA dynamic connected supply-chain with improved forecasting leveraging predictive analytics can serve customers and reduce cost by merging truckload, pallet, case and each movement. Accurate inventory placement is a really good way to make money. Moving forward our supply chain will be an even more effective asset, if it is resilient and more sustainable. \n\u201cWe are actively engaged in reshaping the systems in which we work. We cannot only strengthen our business but use our scale and our capabilities to make a real difference in the world.\u201d\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 51.6652717590332 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
