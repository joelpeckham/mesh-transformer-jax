The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n0 COMMENTS Regulators Find Fault With \u2018Living Wills\u2019 of GE Capital, AIG , AIG 0.66 % Prudential \nRegulators told three financial firms to do a better job explaining how they would handle a bankruptcy without harming the U.S. economy, signaling that the companies have work to do to avoid regulatory sanctions in the future. \nThe firms\u2014General Electric Co.\u2019s financing arm, GE Capital, American International Group Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc.\u2014have been designated \u201csystemically important.\u201d The label comes with a requirement that the companies draft credible \u201cliving wills\u201d for their own demise that don\u2019t involve support from taxpayers. \nThe Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Tuesday that the three firms need to improve their plans before they file new versions at the end of this year. Although the regulators called for improvements, their tone was softer than the one they struck with a set of large U.S. banks that went through the process last year. Regulators at the time raised doubts about the credibility of 11 big banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., C 0.71 % and directed them to make significant revisions or face regulatory sanctions. The regulators asked the three nonbank financial firms Tuesday for more detailed information and analysis about how they would overcome obstacles to orderly bankruptcy, such as ensuring that offices around the globe would have funding during a crisis. They gave each firm individual feedback and instructed them to describe \u201cthe progress they are making, and the steps remaining,\u201d toward making it easier to unwind the firm without taxpayer support. \nAIG declined to comment, and a Prudential spokesman had no comment. A spokesman for GE Capital said the firm \u201cwill work to address\u201d the issues regulators raised. \u2014Ryan Tracy Firm Says Profit Falls, Cautions on OneWest \nCIT Group Inc. CIT -1.01 % said its profit slid in the second quarter and cautioned that a big acquisition could be less lucrative than expected. \nThe Livingston, N.J., lender reported a profit of $115.3 million, down from $246.9 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings dropped to 66 cents from $1.29. Revenue declined 4.1% to $406.6 million. \nAnalysts projected 65 cents in per-share profit on $435 million in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. \nUnder Chief Executive John Thain, CIT has pushed to expand its commercial businesses and earlier this month won regulatory approval for its $3.4 billion acquisition of OneWest Bank and its parent company. The deal is expected to close Aug. 3. The bank Tuesday lowered some financial metrics about that pending deal, including that OneWest\u2019s 2015 profit is on track to be lower than the figure CIT gave when it announced the deal. \u2014Lisa Beilfuss Lender Overcomes Loss of GM Business \nAlly Financial Inc. said its profit fell in the most recent quarter, though the lender recouped almost all of the auto-origination business that it lost from former parent General Motors Co. \nThe company posted earnings of $182 million, down from $323 million a year earlier. Ally\u2019s profit was hurt by a charge for early debt extinguishment. \nOn a per-share basis, Ally reported a loss of $2.22 a share, compared with earnings of 54 cents a share. The loss was largely due to a redemption of preferred securities that resulted in a $155 million charge. Excluding the impact of items, per-share profit rose to 46 cents from 42 cents. \nAdjusted earnings topped Wall Street expectations by a penny, while revenue fell short of estimates as auto lending was little changed from a year earlier. Net financing revenue increased 1.6% to $927 million. Analysts had expected 45 cents in per-share profit and $1.2 billion in net financing revenue, according to FactSet. \nAlly lost a significant part of its auto-lending business this year when GM largely squeezed it out of its lucrative subsidized-leasing business. In the second quarter, auto-loan originations outside of the GM subsidized-leasing business grew by 36% from a year prior, though the loss of that GM business left auto originations relatively flat from a year earlier at $10.8 billion. \u2014Rachel Louise Ensign\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of INVESCO MORTGAGE CAPITAL INC was 5.559722423553467 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of INVESCO MORTGAGE CAPITAL INC was ",
