However, it stunned investors with a 19 cents per share profit, or $92m, in the three months ended June 30. Revenues soared 19.9pc to $23.19bn, beating expectations of $22.39bn. \nSales in the US, Amazon\u2019s biggest market, rose 25.5pc compared with the same period last year, to $13.8bn on trong demand for electronics and general merchandise. \n\u201cThe teams at Amazon have been working hard for customers,\u201d Mr Bezos said. \nThe diverse company, which has branched out into e-book readers and drone delivery, saw cloud-computing revenues soar 81.5pc to $1.82bn. Customers storing digital information online accounted for nearly 8pc of the quarter\u2019s total revenues. \nAmazon Web Services provides cyber space for businesses to save data and run systems, eradicating the need to build data centres and servers costing hundreds of millions.

Customers ordered 398 items every second during the shopping event, helping Amazon sell a total of 34.4m products on the day. Prime Day was so successful, Amazon said it would \u201cdefinitely\u201d run another. \nThe retailing giant said its global shopping day was bigger than Black Friday - the post-Thanksgiving US extravaganza that has arrived in the UK in recent years. \nThe shares jumped 16.7pc to $562.9 in after-hours trading, giving the company a market cap of more than $261bn.
