It has previously said that the founder was having trouble \"making judgements\". \n(Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Tony Munroe and Edwina Gibbs)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was 35.374244689941406 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was ",
