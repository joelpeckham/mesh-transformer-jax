The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMon, Aug 10, 2015, 6:06 PM AEST - Australia Markets closed AMP backs scheme for victims of bad advice AAP \u2013 6 minutes ago \nOne of the nation's largest financial institutions says there should be a victims compensation scheme for those who have fallen foul of financial advisers but have subsequently \"slipped through the cracks\" in receiving damages. \nBut AMP boss Craig Meller has questioned who should pay for such a scheme. \nMr Meller was giving evidence to a long-running Senate inquiry scrutinising financial advice, after a string of scandals at banks and institutions that resulted in thousands of mum and dad investors losing million of dollars over recent years. \nHe says there could be a minimum capital requirement put in place for institutions to pay for a compensation scheme for people who had slipped through the safety net and who had not been remunerated as a result of bad advice. \nBut AMP, for example, is a large corporation that is already well capitalised and self-insured for such events. \n\"We have to ask ourselves, is it appropriate that the shareholders and the customers of AMP end up paying for the incompetence of others in the industry,\" Mr Meller told the hearing. \nHe said AMP had sacked 17 staff in the past five years for serious misconduct in giving advice to customers. \nAsked if any of the 17 were still working in the industry, Mr Meller said: \"I don't know if any of them are - I wouldn't be surprised if some of them, maybe.\" \nNationals Senator John Williams thought that was a \"bit scary\". \nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission has set up a register of financial advisers, through the series of Senate inquiries into the financial advice industry. \nMr Meller said, ideally, the register should show if a \"bad apple\" had been sacked from previous employment for giving poor advice. \nWestpac managing director Brian Hartzer told the hearing his bank had removed 11 planners since January 2009 after they offered bad advice that resulted in the bank paying $2.5 million in compensation to customers. \nThe bank is working with ASIC to ensure such advisers are removed from the industry and do not work in similar positions again. \n\"Too often advisers that have been removed from one firm for doing the wrong thing turn up at another firm,\" Mr Hartzer said. \n\"While we support the ASIC register for advisers, we do think it is important to examine any improvements that could be made to address this issue.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook NAB lifts quarterly profit 9% AAP \nNational Australia Bank has lifted its quarterly cash profit nine per cent to $1.75 billion after a fall in bad \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. was 104.99785614013672 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. was ",
