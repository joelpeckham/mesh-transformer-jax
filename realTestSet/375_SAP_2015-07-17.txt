Rimini Street, Inc. et al., Civil No. 2:10-cv-00106-LRH-PAL (U.S. District Court of Nevada). Statement: Oracle has suffered yet another significant setback in its decade long fight against competition and in the company\u2019s nearly six year litigation against leading global independent software support provider Rimini Street. In a recent Court filing, in response to challenges raised by Rimini Street, Oracle abandoned its biggest damages theory of copyright infringement for its PeopleSoft, JD Edwards and Siebel-branded software products based on fair market value, measured by hypothetical license or income approach, to \u201cstreamline\u201d the issues for trial. Accordingly, Oracle has withdrawn the $210 million damages associated with its fair market value theory. Oracle\u2019s primary remaining copyright damages theory in the case is for lost profits, where Rimini Street asserts Oracle\u2019s theory is without merit due to a complete lack of proof of causation. At trial, Rimini Street will introduce expert testimony that Oracle copyright damages \u2014 if Oracle can prove any damages at all \u2014 are less than $9 million. If the Court, following any appeals, determines that Rimini Street did indeed infringe Oracle\u2019s intellectual property rights with any of its support processes, Rimini Street stands ready and willing to take full responsibility and fairly compensate Oracle for any proven damages, and is committed to correcting any related processes in accordance with Court guidance.
