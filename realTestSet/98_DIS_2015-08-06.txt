The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGetty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. \nU.S. stocks turned lower in early trade on Thursday as investors weighed a continued decline in oil and Disney's stock, ahead of Friday's key employment report. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell 100 points in morning trade as Disney fell 4 percent and energy-sensitive stocks took a hit from oil's decline. \n\"I think this (jobs) report is what everyone's keying on. We've kind of got mixed messages in the data this week,\" said Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets. \n\"I think the key is average hourly earnings and if that comes with a 2 percent increase tomorrow, absolutely September comes into play,\" Gaffney said. \nRead More Earnings? Who cares. All eyes are on Jobs Friday \nGoldman Sachs economists raised their forecast for nonfarm payrolls to 225,000 from 210,000 after the ISM nonmanufacturing survey surged to a 10-year high and included a surprisingly strong employment component. \nEconomists expect a consensus 223,000 nonfarm payrolls, and an unchanged unemployment rate of 5.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. \nWeekly jobless claims came in Thursday at 270,000, slightly below expectations. \nU.S. job cuts soared to a nearly four-year high in July as the military announced plans to reduce troop and civilian workforce payrolls, according to outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \nEmployers based in the United States announced 105,696 layoffs last month, the first time monthly reductions exceeded 100,000 since September 2011. A year ago, U.S. companies announced plans to cut 46,887 jobs. \nRead More Market warming to September rate hike? \nHowever, none of the jobs data so far this week are expected to significantly affect Friday's key report. \n\"We think this increase in announced job cuts will have no impact on the July BLS report, and only a minimal impact on the employment data over the next few years. The jump in layoffs announced in July was basically entirely due to reductions announced by the US Army that are scheduled to begin in October and be implemented over the next two years,\" JPMorgan said in a morning note. \nDisney extended its post-earnings plunge. Year-to-date, the stock is the third-best performer in the Dow. \nViacom fell more than 9.5 percent to a multi-year low. The firm matched earnings per share estimates but missed on revenu as the company did not release any major movies during the quarter. \n21st Century Fox earned an adjusted 39 cents per share for the second quarter, 2 cents above estimates, but revenue missed Street forecasts. The media company also announced a $5 billion stock buyback program. \nCBS reported adjusted quarterly profit of 74 cents per share, 2 cents above estimates, with revenue essentially in line. CBS benefited from higher subscription fees and increasing revenue from affiliates. \nMedia stocks will are in focus after the sector plunged on Wednesday, following Disney 's 9 percent decline after the firm missed on revenue and disappointed investors. \nArt Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, expects some recovery in the sector. \n\"There's a lot of wreckage after Disney,\" he said. \"I think things got overdone.\" \nOil continued to decline, with WTI crude off 1 percent at a fresh five-month low near $44.60 a barrel. Brent traded below $50 a barrel. \n\"I know that a lot of people that are bearish,\" said Phil Flynn, energy market analyst at Price Futures Group. \"As weak as the market feels right now the onus is on the bears to take out $40 a barrel. Really we're following a seasonal pattern.\" \nThe dollar traded flat, with the euro near $1.09. \nTreasury yields held lower, with the 10-year at 2.25 percent and the 2-year at 0.70 percent.
