The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWhy KKR Could Be a Good Pick at Lower Valuations By Robert Karr August 28, 2015 7:09 AM \ue071 \n( Continued from Prior Part ) Returns to shareholders \nKKR & Co. L.P. (KKR) reported economic net income of $840 million for the second quarter of 2015. The company\u2019s earnings increased 40% on strong appreciation in its private equity portfolio. KKR\u2019s distributable earnings increased to $491 million, or $0.57 per unit, in 2Q15. \nThe rise in distributable earnings was not as steep as the rise in economic net income mainly due to lower realized income. KKR has yet to realize profits for the majority of its portfolio\u2019s appreciated value. \nKKR declared a distribution of $0.42 per unit in 2Q15, which translates to an annualized dividend yield of 7.8%. The company\u2019s dividend yield fell due to lower distributions compared to previous quarters, but it\u2019s still competitive when compared to its peers. The Carlyle Group (CG) \u2013 8.08% Blackstone Group (BX) \u2013 7.2% Apollo Global Management (APO) \u2013 12.76% Falling valuations on energy holdings \nKKR is valued at 7.7x on a one-year forward earnings basis compared to its peers trading at 9x. The discount has widened marginally over the last quarter due to the fall in KKR stock prices on account of the decline in its energy holdings. One of the company\u2019s major holdings, Samson Resources Corp., is going to file for bankruptcy by September 2015. Samson Resources has widened its losses on account of falling oil prices (USO). KKR\u2019s two major holdings, Samson Resources and Energy Future Holdings, could result in total losses of $5 billion. \nKKR\u2019s other holdings in the energy space are divided almost equally between natural gas and oil. The company is expected to benefit from this natural gas hedge, as natural gas continues to drive results due to its links to the power sector. KKR also expects to hold a longer stake in oil companies until commodity prices turn favorable. KKR, with more than 7% distribution and performing portfolio companies, could be a good pick for growth and retirement options. \nBrowse this series on Market Realist:\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of KKR & Co.
