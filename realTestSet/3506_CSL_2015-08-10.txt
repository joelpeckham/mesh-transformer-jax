The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia\u2019s CSL warns of biotech bubble Jamie Smyth in Sydney \u00a9Bloomberg \nCSL , the Australian company that recently bought Novartis\u2019s influenza business, has warned of a \u201cbiotech bubble\u201d amid a frenzy of mergers and acquisition activity across the healthcare sector. \n\u201cYou are seeing huge amounts, billions of dollars, being spent on technologies and development programmes that really have not been proven,\u201d said Paul Perreault, CSL chief executive. More Mylan claims US \u2018too shareholder-centric\u2019 \n\u201cI see the premiums they are paying and people need to be careful.\u201d \nThere is growing debate over whether a bubble is developing in biotech after the Nasdaq Biotech index nearly doubled to 3,807 over the past two years. \nThis has coincided with a wave of M&A activity in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sector, including Shire \u2019s US$30bn hostile takeover approach last week to US drugmaker Baxalta \u2014 a key competitor of CSL. \n\u201cThe big pharma companies have a lot of patent cliffs they are running into so they are struggling for growth,\u201d said Mr Perreault. \u201cThey are investing in more in early stage research and development and biotech companies, which in my view has created a bit of a bubble.\u201d \nMr Perreault described CSL as \u201cone of the biggest companies that nobody has heard of\u201d but the former government-owned manufacturer of vaccines and plasma protein biotherapies has become a darling of the Australian Stock Exchange. It is due to report full-year results on Wednesday and is trading on a price/earnings ratio of 22 times forecast 2016 earnings \u2014 on par with the sector but above the ASX\u2019s average forward p/e ratio of 16. \nCSL is the best-performing top 20 company on the ASX over the past 12 months, with its shares surging in value by 50 per cent to A$96.36. Its stock price last week briefly surpassed A$100 when CSL closed its US$275m acquisition of Novartis\u2019s flu business. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the flu business for 100 years. This deal gives us the scale and ability to globalise the influenza [treatment] business,\u201d said Mr Perreault. \u201cIt makes us the second largest in the space.\u201d \nCSL bought the Novartis flu business when the opportunity emerged during a US$20bn asset swap between Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline . Mr Perreault forecast combined annual sales from the integrated flu businesses will reach US$1bn within three years, up from US$650m. \nAndrew Goodsall, UBS analyst, said the price looked good and CSL has a strong record of integrating its rare acquisitions. \n\u201cWe are very choosy. Just because I have money burning a hole in our pocket doesn\u2019t mean I have to go out and buy something,\u201d said Mr Perreault. \u201cIt is really hard to do something that really adds value. We have an organic growth plan and really innovate in our space.\u201d \nOver the past five years CSL has invested US$2bn in R&D and employs more than 1,000 scientists. Its purchase from Novartis gives it access to cutting-edge research, laboratories and products, including its quadrivalent influenza vaccine, which has been submitted for approval to the US Food and Drug Administration. \nThe vaccine targets four strains of flu virus, rather than three, which improves its effectiveness even as the virus mutates during a season. Last year, for example, just 30 per cent of flu vaccines were effective, said Mr Perreault. \nMr Perreault said CSL\u2019s core blood plasma business offers growth opportunities with two new haemophilia drugs due to be launched in the next calendar year. He said a new drug called CSL 112, used to treat heart attack victims and prevent secondary attacks, is undergoing safety trials. \n\u201cThat would be a blockbuster if it hits,\u201d he said. \nUBS\u2019s Mr Goodsall said Shire\u2019s bid for Baxalta suggests big pharma may see opportunity in the blood plasma sector and could generate interest in CSL. However, the company's high valuation and army of 100,000 retail shareholders in Australia may complicate any foreign takeover bid. \n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we weren\u2019t on everyone\u2019s list,\u201d said Mr Perreault. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure where they would see the synergies. We are extremely efficient and a pretty flat organisation: there are no private jets.\u201d Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
