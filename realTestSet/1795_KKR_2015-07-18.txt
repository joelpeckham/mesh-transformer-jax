MUMBAI: The booming ecommerce and startup spaces and signs of an improving economy have helped India record more than $9.5 billion, or over Rs 60,000 crore, in private equity investment deals in the first six months of 2015. If the current pace continues, total PE deals this year will surpass the record $17.1 billion, or about Rs 108,000 crore at current exchange rate, set in 2007. According to data from global consulting firm Bain & Company, there have been 650 private equity and venture capital deals in the country in the six months ended June, totalling $9.5 billion. This is 65% of the volume recorded in the whole of last year when there were 795 deals worth $15.2 billion. \"The inflow of PE money into India is primarily because investors believe that India will get back on the growth cycle again and it represents an attractive destination compared to other large emerging markets,\" said Sri Rajan, Bain India MD and senior leader of Bain & Company's private equity consulting practice. \"Among major emerging markets, it (India) is one of the most attractive investment destinations, if not the most attractive one,\" he said. Post the global meltdown of 2008, India PE investments had taken a hit. The coming to power of the Narendra Modi government, which is considered pro-business, seems to have revived India's appeal as an investment destination. Global investors such as Warburg Pincus , KKR , Blackstone , Temasek and Apax Partners are among PEs that have stepped up their India investments in the last two years. The sectors that have attracted most PE deals include ecommerce, financial services, healthcare and technology . Some of the key deals in the first half of this year include Baring Asia's $440-million buyout of Blackstone-backed ATM cash management services firm CMS Infosystems and Olacabs' $400 million fund raise from a group of existing and new investors including GIC, DST Global, Falcon Edge Capital and Accel USA. Also, an over 20% stake in listed consumer lender Shriram City Union Finance changed hands from one PE investor, TPG Capital, to another, Apax Partners, for $383 million. The Advent International-led $315 million buyout of a 34.4% stake in Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals from its promoter Avantha Group was the next largest transaction so far this year. There have been several deals where investors who entered the Indian market in 2007-08 at sky high valuations managed to exit from many of their investments. \"PE investments have zoomed in H1 2015 due to a higher number of secondary transactions, which also provided exit to the vintage transactions of 2006-08,\" said Sanjeev Krishan, executive director and head of private equity at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. Around 60% of the deals have been secondary, where one PE fund buys out from others. A senior managing director and India head of a PE fund expects this trend to continue. \"Lack of a buoyant IPO market has left the PE funds with few options for exits and secondaries will continue to be a preferred option for some time now,\" said the person who requested not to be named. Funds that were raised in 2006-07 are maturing in 2015 and will have to return capital to their investments and the current spurt in activity can also be attributed to this, the person added. Indian PE fund managers have returned just 30 cents for every dollar invested in India prior to 2009 against a promise of delivering around 20%-25% returns on capital. However, this time around, the fund managers have found new winners. Ecommerce continues to be the flavour and most of the money \u2014 around 44% has flowed into the sector. \"The spurt in deal activity is a confluence of few things such as significant deal activity in the ecommerce space and a lot of PE-to-PE trades,\" said Pramod Kumar, managing director and head of advisory at Barclays India . PE investors have taken a pragmatic view that India's growth prospects are looking better from here and hence it is a good time to invest. \"However, most of the deals today are outside of ecommerce are more situation specific and not necessary growth capital,\" he said.  \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of KKR & Co.
