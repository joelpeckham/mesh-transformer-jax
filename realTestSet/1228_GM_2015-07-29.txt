The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGeneral Motors ploughs $1bn into India to reverse sales decline James Crabtree in Mumbai and Jyotsna Singh in New Delhi \u00a9Bloomberg \nGeneral Motors plans to invest $1bn in India to boost production and transform the country into a \u201cglobal export hub\u201d, as America\u2019s largest carmaker by sales tries to reverse its poor performance in one of the world\u2019s most important automotive growth markets. \nSpeaking in New Delhi, chief executive Mary Barra revealed proposals to close one of GM\u2019s two Indian facilities and focus investment on its remaining plant, as the first step in wider plans to spend $5bn across emerging economies. More Volkswagen sales nudge past Toyota \nThe $1bn plan is the largest investment by a global auto group in India since 2011, and makes GM the latest player to double down in a market that is set to become the world\u2019s third largest by volume over the next decade. \nIndia represents one of the biggest challenges in Ms Barra\u2019s plans to keep pace with rivals Toyota and Volkswagen by promoting GM's Chevrolet brand in fast-growing developing nations. \nThe US-based group\u2019s market share in India sank from 4 per cent in 2011 to just 2 per cent last year, despite having invested $1bn in the country since 1996. It has endured a string of sales flops with mid-market vehicles that failed to chime with budget-conscious Indian customers. \n\u201cGM cannot remain a global leader without making a serious commitment to expanding our presence in growth markets like India,\u201d Ms Barra said. \nThe group plans to launch 10 \u201clocally produced\u201d Chevrolet vehicles in India over the next 5 years, while moving to close its facility at Halol in the western state of Gujarat by the end of 2016. \nIn its place, GM will expand its plant in the neighbouring state of Maharashtra, increasing capacity from 130,000 vehicles to 220,000 by 2025. About a third of that production will be exported, as the group seeks to turn India into a production base for other emerging economies around Asia. \nAlthough rivals including Ford and VW have also struggled to recoup their heavy investments in India , GM\u2019s performance has been \u201cby far the worst\u201d of the global car groups, according to Deepesh Rathore, co-founder of New Delhi-based research group Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors. \n\u201cThere is something fundamentally wrong with the Chevy brand in India, which customers just aren\u2019t connecting with,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is something the company can\u2019t fix overnight \u2014 it will have to be a long, steady fightback.\u201d \nWednesday\u2019s announcement marks the latest stage in dramatic changes to GM\u2019s global production plans, as it pulls back from smaller markets such as Indonesia and Thailand, and refocuses on larger nations, notably Brazil, China, Mexico and India. \nGM said it aimed to double its market share in India by 2020, a goal that would in effect only see it make up ground lost over the past five years to more successful rivals such as Honda of Japan and Hyundai of South Korea, which produce smaller, cheaper vehicles more suited to Indian tastes. \nIt also plans to cut costs by \u201clocalising\u201d production through increased use of domestic suppliers, while expanding its domestic dealer network to improve customer service levels \u2014 an important consideration for customers on India\u2019s bumpy roads.
