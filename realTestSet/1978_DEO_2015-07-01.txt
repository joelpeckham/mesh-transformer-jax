In 2014 it hosted golf\u2019s Ryder Cup tournament. \nThe company also used the hotel to promote its scotch brands, regularly holding tournaments there, most notably the Johnnie Walker championship. \nGleneagles' courses are on the \"bucket lists\" of many golfers after the Ryder Cup was held there \nFTSE 100-listed Diageo sold the property to a private investment group led by property and hospitality firm Ennismore , which develops and operates upmarket hotels, bars and restaurants in Europe and the US under The Hoxton brand. \n\u2022 In pictures: The 2014 Ryder Cup \nGleneagles, which was bought by Ennismore for an undisclosed amount, had revenues of \u00a343.5m in the year to June 30 2014, and made an operating profit of \u00a32.6m with a return on invested capital of 4pc based on the property\u2019s book value. \nIvan Menezes, chief executive of Diageo, said: \u201cWe are proud to have been the owner of Gleneagles but the hotel is not a core business for us and therefore following the success of the Ryder Cup we feel this is an appropriate time to realise value through this transaction. \n\u201cI am pleased that Diageo\u2019s brands, especially our scotch brands, will continue to be an important feature at this iconic Scottish hotel. We wish Ennismore and all the staff at the hotel a successful future.\u201d\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Diageo plc was 97.96214294433594 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Diageo plc was ",
