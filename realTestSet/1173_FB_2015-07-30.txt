REUTERS/Dado Ruvic \nFacebook ( FB ) revealed stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits and sales after the close on Wednesday, but it wasn't enough to impress investors and the firm's shares fell slightly in extended trading. \nThe world's biggest social network said it earned adjusted profits of 50 cents a share, up 16% from a year ago and topping Wall Street analysts' average estimate by three cents. Sales, meanwhile, grew 39% to $4.04 billion, also exceeding estimates of $3.99 billion. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long warned that the company would be increasing expenses more quickly than revenue as it moved to grab an increasing share of users' attention around the world, especially on mobile and video. Total costs and expenses in the latest quarter rose 82% to $2.8 billion and net income measured according to generally accepted accounting principles declined 9% to $719 million. \nBut the bet looks to be paying off, as Facebook's average monthly active users climbed 13% year-over-year to 1.49 billion and daily active users jumped 17% to 968 million. While many of its competitors are struggling with the shift from desktop computers to mobile phones, Facebook increased its daily mobile user base by 29% to 844 million. \nOn a call with analysts, CEO Mark Zuckerberg ticked off more than a dozen improvements to Facebook's services and apps. The company's separate Messenger app now has more than 700 million users, he said. \"These milestones are a good sign that we\u2019re on the right path here,\" Zuckerberg said. \nCFO Dave Wehner warned investors that revenue growth at Facebook would continue to slow for teh rst of the year. \"Since the first quarter of 2014, we've seen year-over-year advertising revenue growth rates decline each subsequent quarter,\" he said. \"We expect this trend to continue in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to grow off a much larger base (and) face currency headwinds to the strong dollar.\" \nWehner also disclosed that the company's photo sharing app, Instagram, apparently hasn't experienced as much growth this year as other Facebook services. The app has 300 million users, he said, which is the same level Facebook reported at the end of last year . \nWehner's outlook pushed the price of Facebook's shares down about 2% in extended traded. The shares had initially sold off as much as 5% on the results, but erased those losses as Zuckerberg discussed highlights for the quarter. As of Wednesday's close, the stock was up about 24% for 2015. \nFacebook and Wall Street analysts focus on the company's profit excluding the cost of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and other costs counted under GAAP. Including those costs, Facebook earned 25 cents per share, down from 30 cents a year ago.
