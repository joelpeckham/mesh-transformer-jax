Though they said overseas turmoil had not \"materially altered\" economic prospects, they opted to hold interest rates steady last month. \n\"When the dust settled the message for the market was that the FOMC was pretty confident on the robustness of the U.S. economy and saw room for 2015 lift-off, but no imperative to do so if fragility persisted,\" Steven Englander, global head of currency strategy at Citi, said in a note. \nRiskier asset markets, which had risen when the Fed held off raising rates in September, got a further boost on confirmation policy makers won't rush to tighten rates at a time of slackening global growth. \nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.7 percent in early trading, on track for a robust weekly gain of 5.7 percent. \nThe S&P 500 (SPX) closed at a seven-week high on Thursday, though S&P 500 e-mini futures (ESc1) edged down about 0.1 percent in early Asian trading. \nJapan's Nikkei stock index (.N225) added 1 percent, poised to gain 3.4 percent for the week. \nThe dollar withered in line with fading near-term rate-hike expectations, with the dollar index (.DXY) down about 0.1 percent in early Asian trade, on track for a weekly loss of 0.6 percent. \nThe euro rose about 0.1 percent to $1.1285 (EUR=) after scaling a three-week peak of $1.1328 on Thursday, while the dollar was steady against its Japanese counterpart at 119.91 yen (JPY=). \nGold (XAU=) added about 0.1 percent to $1,140.01 an ounce, on track for a weekly gain of about 0.2 percent, after volatile trading in the wake of the Fed minutes. A delayed hike to interest rates could support gold in the near term. \n(Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was 144.83436584472656 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was ",
