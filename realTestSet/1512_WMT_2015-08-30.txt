The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPublished: Aug 30, 2015 7:57 a.m. ET Share Only 100+ shopping days until Christmas! \nBy Catey Hill Reporter \nIt\u2019s not even Labor Day yet, but that\u2019s not stopping Wal-Mart from trying to get consumers to start their holiday shopping. \nOn Thursday, Wal-Mart WMT, -1.73% announced that it was \u201cgearing up for the 2015 holiday season\u201d by launching its first-ever Toy Week (a sneak peek at some of the top toys for the holiday season) and starting its holiday layaway program on Friday, giving consumers from now until Dec. 14 to pay for their Christmas presents. This is \u201ca full two weeks earlier than last year,\u201d the company boasted in an email sent this morning. \nIn other words, it\u2019s official \u2014 Christmas creep now starts in August. \nMolly Blakeman, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said that the company knows that not all customers are ready to do their holiday shopping this early in the year, but some are \u2014 and the early layaway program will help them. \nWhat\u2019s more, they\u2019re not the only retailer who starts thinking about Christmas when it\u2019s still 90 degrees out. In 2013, Kmart SHLD, +1.37% launched a holiday commercial just a few days after Labor Day. And Hobby Lobby begins selling Christmas decorations in May . \nThis, we have no doubt, is going to dismay many Americans. More than seven in 10 Americans say they are either \u201cannoyed\u201d or \u201cvery annoyed\u201d when they see holiday items in stores before Halloween, a survey by data firm RichRelevance found. \nAnd while some shoppers may not be ready to think about decking the halls when they\u2019re still on summer break, some people \u2014 roughly one in 10 Americans -- are all about the Christmas Creep, saying they either \u201clike\u201d or \u201clove\u201d when retailers load up the shelves with holiday items before Halloween. And layaway plans do help lots of consumers \u2014 particularly those who have poor credit or little money -- get the items they want for the holidays.
