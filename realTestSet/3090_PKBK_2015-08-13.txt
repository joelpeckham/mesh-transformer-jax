The Company's most recent quarterly cash dividend was $0.07 per share payable on August 3, 2015. The Board of Directors anticipates maintaining the same level of total cash dividends to shareholders post-split, thus the quarterly cash dividend will be adjusted to be $0.035 per share. \nRobert T. Strong, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, \"I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has determined that this stock split in the form of a stock dividend is in the best interest of our shareholders, as the reduced trading price per share and the doubling of the shares outstanding will promote new investor interest and enhance liquidity in the market.
