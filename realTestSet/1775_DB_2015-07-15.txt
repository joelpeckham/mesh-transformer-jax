The eurozone needs to foot its own bill.\" \nThe fund became notorious in 2010 when, in the weekend after the general election, Alistair Darling allowed it to help finance bailout cash for Portugal and Ireland - despite Mr Osborne's reluctance. \nThe UK was subsequently assured it would not be used in future bailouts. \nHowever, the European Commission said today that if Greece is to get the short-term cash it desperately needs to pay its coming debts - including a \u20ac3.5bn (\u00a32.5bn) ECB loan repayment due next Monday - the EFSM may be the only plausible fund it can mobilise in time. \nIt came as Greek MPs arrived at their parliament ahead of a vote on measures aimed at saving their economy. \nOn Monday, Sky News revealed that the fund was back under consideration in relation to the bailout. \nThe EFSM gets its money by borrowing in the open markets, backed by the EU Budget. \nIf a country defaults on an EFSM loan, the losses would potentially come out of the EU Budget, which includes all 28 countries, rather than just the 19 Euro members. \nAccording to Treasury sources, Britain could only consider the use of the EFSM if Britain and other non-euro members are fully-protected against the possibility of a default. \nIn the case of this Greek bridging loan, Britain's exposure could amount to around \u00a3600m. \nThat could mean using some cash from other sources, including the proceeds from the European Central Bank\u2019s Securities Markets Programme (SMP), in which it bought up sovereign bonds to stabilise the market during the crisis. The technical details are still under discussion among officials in Brussels. \nThe source said: \"We have very clear principle which is pretty widely accepted that British taxpayers should not be on the hook for a eurozone bailout.\" \nHowever, the UK is concerned about being painted as the block to a deal which could resolve Greece's crisis. \nThe country's longer-term bailout is due to be provided largely by a euro-only fund, the European Stability Mechanism, which was set up after the 2010 controversy over the use of the EFSM.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 31.397863388061523 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
