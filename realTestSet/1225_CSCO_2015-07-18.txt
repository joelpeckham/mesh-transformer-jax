 "context": "The following article called 'Cisco's John Chambers on two decades as chief: 'You have to let go'' was published on 2015-07-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n129.62 +1.11 \nIn interview before stepping down at the end of the month, internet giant's boss says Europe is ahead of US in new digital era \nIn a week\u2019s time, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s longest-serving bosses will step down. John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, may not be as recognisable a name as Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey of Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) , but when he took charge of the networking equipment giant in 1995 the future bosses of Twitter and Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) were still in school. \nIn the last 20 years, Chambers has grown the company from a mid-sized internet router manufacturer, with annual sales of $70m (\u00a345m), to a $50bn-a-year behemoth. \nThrough a long series of ambitious acquisitions under Chambers, most of which paid off, it established a foothold in almost every aspect of the internet\u2019s infrastructure. From servers to network switches, and the software that operates it all, Cisco can best be described as a company that builds much of the internet\u2019s \u201cplumbing\u201d. \nAnd it is very good at it. Cisco claims to be number one or two in almost all the 165-plus countries it operates in, and has done for some time. By its own estimates, more than half the world\u2019s online traffic travels through Cisco\u2019s systems. \nIn fact, in March 2000 at the height of the dotcom boom, Cisco briefly overtook Microsoft (NasdaqGS: MSFT - news ) to become the world\u2019s most valuable company , with a market cap of some $555bn. In the next 12 months, it crashed spectacularly, although unlike many victims of the bubble, Cisco and Chambers survived. \nSpeaking to The Telegraph in his last interview before relinquishing his role to long-time prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chuck Robbins and becoming chairman, Chambers was steadfast in his assertion that ever-increasing connectivity, between both humans and machines, will be a catalyst for growth and employment over the next decade. \nAt the start of the month, Chambers had something of a farewell tour. From Cisco\u2019s headquarters in San Jose, California, he visited London, Paris, Berlin, New Delhi and Beijing. On his visits in Europe, Cisco announced major investment deals, including a promise to invest $1bn in Britain over three to five years, including potential acquisitions. It was the second-such announcement in five years, after a $500m commitment in 2011, ahead of the Olympics. \nChambers, who has a knack of positioning himself alongside world leaders for major announcements, held a meeting with David Cameron at Downing Street on the same day. \u201cCameron, he gets it,\u201d Chambers opines in a recognisable southern drawl. \n\u201cI had the honour to work with him before. He basically said, 'We\u2019re going to make the UK great for business. We\u2019re going to use the Olympics to generate a new concept of innovation.\u2019 We were a very good partner.\u201d \nChambers, a 65-year-old who only spent four years at Cisco before becoming CEO, likes to talk an hour-long interview barely contains the time for half a dozen questions. He is particularly forthright, though, in espousing the apparent economic benefits of connecting the world. \nChambers with Tony Blair and Steve Jobs in 2006 (EPA) \nThe company\u2019s latest mission is creating the \u201cinternet of everything\u201d; installing sensors and radios in almost everything, from industrial equipment to everyday items, creating connections between them and using that data to become massively efficient. \nFor example, a robotic arm in a car manufacturing plant could monitor itself and alert engineers when a part becomes faulty, reducing the need for time-consuming check-ups and repairs. Or street lights could respond to light or how many people are on the street, saving power. \nChambers claims this revolution can boost a nation\u2019s economic growth by up to 3pc a year, although perhaps rarely for a Silicon Valley stalwart, and a noted Republican Chambers co-chaired John McCain\u2019s 2008 bid for president he believes the state has a big role to play, encouraging infrastructure and setting standards that the private sector can implement \nUnlike the rise of the internet in the 1990s, though, Chambers says the UK and Europe are ahead of America in this regard. \u201cIn the internet era during the 1990s, the US led and other countries followed. We\u2019re about to see an instant replay of that, except it will have five to 10 times the impact,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cEverything connects, and it completely changes the process.\u201d \n\u201cEurope is actually leading in the digitisation era. Germany got it first and the UK also has tremendous momentum,\u201d he says. \nChambers believes connectivity can boost growth by up to 3pc a year \nCisco felt the pain more than most in 2000\u2019s internet crash, losing more than three quarters of its value within a year, and some commentators have speculated that Silicon Valley is once again in a bubble. A technology group Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) is once again the world\u2019s most valuable, and start-ups without revenues are regularly valued at more than a billion dollars. Chambers doubts a repeat performance is on the cards, however. \u201cThere will be a number of companies that will crash and burn, just like some of the companies we used to compete with don\u2019t exist today, but the price to earnings ratios of most of the companies in the Valley are pretty reasonable.\u201d \nAlthough he will step down as chief executive on Sunday, Chambers is by no means letting go. He will stay on as chairman, a role he has held since 2006, to enable a smooth transition at what he says is the right time to hand over, when sales and profits are improving following a long period of investment in new technology and significant job cuts. \n\u201cThe hi-tech industry has historically not done very well on its CEO transitions, especially when the CEO has led the company for a decade or two,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a new one coming in when momentum is picking up, so we need to continue to do the things we\u2019re doing right.\u201d \nHowever, he denies he will be hovering over Robbins when the transition does happen. \u201cYou have to let go, I\u2019ve been mentally aware that the thing you cannot do is be hugely involved in the decisions and operations,\u201d Chambers says. \u201cI will be his wingman, like over the last few years he\u2019s been my wingman. You can\u2019t tell your kids what to do when they\u2019re adults.\u201d\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Cisco Systems, Inc. was 23.12228775024414 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Cisco Systems, Inc. was ",
