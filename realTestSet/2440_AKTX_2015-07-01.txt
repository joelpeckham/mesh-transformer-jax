Sharp is highly dependent on short-term borrowings, and the average maturity of its debt is short. \n\"Therefore, we consider the potential need for massive refinancing a negative factor and incorporate this into our ratings.\" \nIn May Sharp announced it was cutting 10 percent of its 49,000-strong workforce worldwide as part of a turnaround plan intended to keep it afloat after posting a bigger-than-expected $1.86 billion annual loss. \nThe embattled Aquos-brand maker said it would sell the building that houses its Osaka headquarters to raise cash, roll out unspecified pay cuts, and launch a drastic capital reduction plan to wipe away huge losses.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was 5.800000190734863 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was ",
