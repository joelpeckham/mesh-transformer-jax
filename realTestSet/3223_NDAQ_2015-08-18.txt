They have also been hurt by falls in food prices, reflecting record commodity-led deflation. \n(Reporting by James davey, writing by Paul Sandle; editing by Kate Holton)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. was 48.330284118652344 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. was ",
