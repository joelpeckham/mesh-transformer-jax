Performance of this metal and plastic packaging company will mainly be hurt by adverse currency translation. Elevated aluminum premiums, pricing pressure in China and weak demand in Brazil also remain headwinds for Ball Corporation.Ball Corporation\u2019s first-quarter 2015 results were considerably affected by foreign exchange volatility. Given the company\u2019s extensive exposure to Europe, strengthening of the dollar against the euro represents a significant concern. Consequently, the company expects currency translation to remain a headwind for the balance of 2015.Ball Corporation also witnessed higher metal premiums in Europe and start-up costs in the first quarter. The food and household segment suffered due to the customer shift in the U.S. food cans. Hence, metal premiums and startup costs will persist as headwinds in the second quarter of 2015.In the Asia segment, pricing continues to be an issue as excess capacity and intense competition from domestic can producers have led to pricing pressure in China. Though the company witnessed volume growth in the segment during the first quarter, it expects volumes to decline in the second quarter.Notably, Ball Corporation\u2019s results in Brazil will be pitted against the increased sales during the Soccer World cup last year, leading to tough comparisons.
