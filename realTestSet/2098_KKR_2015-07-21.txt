First Data, a payment technology and services company that's based in Atlanta but has offices in lower Manhattan in the old World Financial Center complex, filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of its common stock. The number of shares to be offered, the price range and the stock exchange listing for the offering have not yet been determined. The listing is expected to take place after Labor Day.
