The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWed, Jul 15, 2015, 2:50 PM AEST - Australia Markets close in 1 hr 10 mins BHP to take surprise $US2.8 billion hit AAP \u2013 17 minutes ago View Photo \n\nBHP Billiton has flagged a bigger-than-expected $US2.8 billion hit to its full year earnings flowing from writedowns in its US oil and gas assets amid soft prices. \nThe mining giant announced the pre-tax writedowns on Wednesday, saying they were mostly linked to its gas-focused Hawkville field in Texas. \nThe company insisted the move did not reflect the underlying quality of its broader onshore US operations, and plans to invest $US1.5 billion on the business in the 2016 financial year. \n\"With industry-leading drilling costs and recoveries, we are well positioned to realise significant value for shareholders as we develop our high-quality resource base,\" BHP's petroleum president Tim Cutt said. \nBHP shares dropped following the announcement and were down 35.5 cents, or 1.3 per cent, at $26.745 by 1425 AEST. \nIG Markets strategist Evan Lucas said while an asset writedown was expected, the amount was bigger than most people expected. \n\"Clearly the forecasting and operations per WTI (West Texas Intermediate) oil was a lot higher than what actually they've managed to extract in the 2015 financial year,\" Mr Lucas said. \nAll four of BHP's divisions were seeing prices that had not been forecast, putting pressure on margins, he added. \n\"It's playing catchup,\" Mr Lucas said. \n\"(BHP) has low costs but clearly the price is offsetting that, and the margin squeeze is really hurting them, and that may be why they're having to take quite a large impairment charge to offset the balance sheet.\" \nOil prices dived from more than $US100 per barrel in early 2014 to as low as $US46 in early 2015 amid an oversupply in the US and Middle East, and a slowdown in the Chinese and eurozone economies. \nBHP, one of the largest overseas investors in US shale, spent $US20 billion buying up assets in 2011 to capitalise on the region's oil and gas boom. \nBut BHP in February scrapped the planned sale of its US Fayetteville shale assets in the face of weak oil prices. \nIt slashed its US onshore shale capital expenditure budget by 15 per cent to $US3.4 billion for 2014/15 and to $US2.2 billion for the following financial year amid plans to reduce drilling activity. \nBHP's latest writedown comes after its poorly-performing Fayetteville assets were infamously written down by $US2.84 billion in 2012, a year after the miner paid $US4.75 billion to buy them. \nIG Markets' Mr Lucas said the miner would probably come under further pressure given West Texas crude oil prices were likely to stay below $US70 a barrel. \nChinese demand was unlikely to rise anytime soon, Mr Lucas said, while on the supply side Saudi Arabia was at record production and Iran would shortly introduce its oil into the market. \n\"Supply is continuing to ramp up,\" he said. \n\"At the bowser it's happy news, but for players like BHP this is a headache that they probably weren't foreseeing over their 10-year (forecast) period.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was 29.833030700683594 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was ",
