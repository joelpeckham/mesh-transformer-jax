Bush. \nShell has spent about $7 billion on exploration in the Arctic. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) has not explored in the region since 2012, when the company suffered a series of mishaps in region, including losing control of an enormous rig, from which the Coast Guard had to rescue 18 workers. \nThe Arctic is home to what the U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . government estimates is 20 percent of the world's undiscovered oil and gas. \nShell's determination to drill there has spawned funding drives and a wave of protests by environmentalists who want to protect whales, walruses and polar bears in a vulnerable region that scientists say is changing rapidly due to global warming. \nCurtis Smith, a Shell spokesman, said the company \"looks forward to evaluating what could potentially become a national energy resource base.\" Shell said it was possible it could complete a well this summer, but it is not releasing a timeline for the drilling.
