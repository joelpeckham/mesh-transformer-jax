The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSee Also: Best Dividend Stocks of the S&P 500 \nDividends are actually quite common in small-cap country. More than half of the companies in Standard & Poor\u2019s Small-Cap 600 Stock Index pay dividends, and they yield an average 2.3%, slightly trailing the 2.4% yield of dividend payers in the S&P 500 (the full S&P 500, which includes companies that don\u2019t pay dividends, yields 2.1%). Granted, most of these businesses aren\u2019t likely to make the big leagues. Financial companies and utilities dominate the roster of small-capitalization stocks, so you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find the next Under Armour (symbol UA ) on the list. \nStill, sticking with dividend payers can be a winning plan. Small-cap dividend stocks in the Russell 2000 index gained an average of 11.2% annualized over a 22-year period ending December 31, 2014, beating nonpayers by an average of 3.1 percentage points per year, according to a recent report by the Royce Funds, whose products focus on small-cap stocks. \u201cDividend-paying companies have staying power,\u201d says Jay Kaplan, manager of the Royce Total Return ( RYTRX ) and Royce Dividend Value ( RDVIX ) funds. \u201cThey tend to be better-quality businesses, and they give you a better return while taking some risk off the table.\u201d Advertisement \nCompanies that can pay dividends without much financial stress offer the most upside. These businesses tend to be solidly profitable, have a manageable amount of debt, and should be able to increase their dividends consistently, giving investors a raise each year. \nKeeping those factors in mind, we found four stocks and one exchange-traded fund that look compelling from both a growth and an income perspective. (Share prices and related figures are as of August 12.) \nTopping our lineup is ABM Industries ( ABM , $33.06), a building maintenance and repair company that hasn\u2019t missed a dividend payment in nearly 50 years. Sales are climbing 4% a year, and the company is a model of stability. It signs long-term contracts with airports, hospitals and other big businesses, and recent acquisitions have enhanced its janitorial, energy industry and aviation services. Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 15% in the fiscal year that ends in October, followed by an 8% increase in the 2016 fiscal year. \nABM also has the capacity to raise its dividend, thanks to its prodigious free cash flow (earnings plus depreciation and other noncash charges, minus the capital spending needed to maintain the business). The company\u2019s annual dividend rate is 64 cents a share, just 37% of its estimated 2015 free cash flow of $1.72 per share. For investors who want a stable, defensive dividend payer, the stock looks attractive, says Andrew Wittmann, an analyst for investment bank Robert W. Baird. His 12-month price target: $38 per share. ABM's dividend yield is 1.9%. \nRegional bank City Holding ( CHCO , $47.74) holds appeal for both its 3.5% dividend yield and its potential to boost its payout. With 82 branches in Kentucky, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia, the bank is a \u201cbig player in a small market,\u201d says Kaplan. \nCity has snapped up a string of branches in recent years, including three in Lexington, Ky., a new market for the bank. It has a solid balance sheet and capital levels well above regulatory requirements, and its loan portfolio features a lot of steadily paying home equity loans and residential mortgages. Analysts expect the bank to earn $3.13 per share this year, almost double its dividend payout of $1.66 per share\u2014leaving plenty of leeway for higher dividends in the future. \nUnless you\u2019re under age 30, you may not be familiar with clothing retailer Buckle ( BKE , $41.50). But its designer jeans and other apparel are a hit with teenagers and young adults. Compared with rival brands, Buckle offers more attentive service and higher-quality denim, says Kaplan. Sales have climbed an average of 9.4% a year for the past decade, and earnings have expanded at a 14.6% annualized pace. Paying out at an annual rate of $0.92 per share, the stock yields 2.2%.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was 6.400000095367432 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was ",
