 "context": "The following article called 'Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. Announces Preliminary Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results' was published on 2015-10-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n1.60 % \nThe following key issues contributed to the third quarter results as compared to the same period in 2014: \nInterest income \u2013 Despite gross loan balances being above year-end 2014 by $15.9 million (3%), they declined $3.2 million for the third quarter. Unanticipated loan payoffs combined with a highly competitive rate environment for new credit have made it difficult to maintain loan balances and loan yield. A significant portion of the cash balances at June 30, 2015 were invested in lower yielding investment securities. These factors have had a negative impact on interest income and net interest margin. Also negatively impacting interest income and loan yield for the quarter was the reversal of interest income accrued in the amount of $211,000 related to one loan relationship that was placed on non-accrual (see further discussion below). The Company\u2019s total earning asset yield during the quarter was 4.05% as compared to 4.19% during the same quarter in 2014. \nInterest expense - On the liability side, efforts to increase lower-cost, core deposit relationships have created opportunities for reductions in the Company\u2019s cost of funding. The prepayment of the Company\u2019s remaining $10 million repurchase agreement during the second quarter has also improved cost of funds. The average cost of funds for the quarter was .78% as compared to .84% for the same quarter in 2014. Going forward, the Company will utilize a cost effective mix of retail deposits and non-core, wholesale funding to fund its organic asset growth. \nProvision for loan loss expense and allowance for loan losses \u2013 Based on its reserve analysis and methodology, the Company recorded a provision for loan loss expense of $200,000 during the quarter, a decline from the $450,000 recognized during the prior year quarter. \nThe allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2015 was 1.34% of gross loans outstanding (excluding mortgage loans held for sale), representing no change from the 1.34% as of December 31, 2014. Management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a sufficient level to provide for potential loan losses in the Bank\u2019s existing loan portfolio. \nNon-interest income \u2013 Non-interest income increased $297,000 during the quarter primarily due to the Company\u2019s gains on sales of loans. The Company\u2019s gains on sales of fixed-rate loans in the secondary market increased $224,000 compared to the prior year quarter. Fixed-rate mortgage volume of $14.5 million for the quarter was an increase of 40% compared to the prior year quarter. \nNon-interest expense \u2013 Non-interest expense increased $476,000 over the prior year quarter due to a few significant items. \nSalaries and employee benefits have increased $265,000 due to the addition of several key officers during the last several quarters. The Company continues to strengthen its depth in the areas of technology, marketing, commercial and retail production in order to position itself for future growth and expansion. Also impacting compensation were mortgage commissions which have increased due to the mortgage volume noted above. \nOther expenses that experienced increases were occupancy expense which has increased $53,000 from the prior year quarter primarily due to depreciation expense recognized on new equipment purchases in late fourth quarter 2014 and into 2015. Legal expense increased $45,000 quarter over quarter due to work performed in conjunction with troubled borrowers. Also, the Company has increased its marketing efforts in 2015 and third quarter expense increased $25,000 over the prior year quarter. \nProvision for income taxes \u2013 The increase in the provision for income taxes for the quarter is a direct result of the Company\u2019s increase in taxable income. \nCapital \u2013 At September 30, 2015, stockholders\u2019 equity increased to $65.8 million compared to $61.5 at December 31, 2014. First, equity increased due to $4.3 million in net income for the nine months. Secondly, as a result of changes in market rates, the Company experienced an increase in the value of its investment portfolio during the nine month period. The equity portion of the Company\u2019s unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities improved by $273,000 at September 30, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. \nFrom a regulatory capital standpoint, all capital ratios for both the Company and the Bank remain strong and above regulatory requirements. \nNonperforming assets \u2013 The Company experienced an increase in its nonperforming assets to $16.4 million as of September 30, 2015 as compared to $8.5 million at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 2.54% as of September 30, 2015 compared to 1.35% as of December 31, 2014. The following loan relationship was the primary contributor to the increase in nonperforming assets during the quarter: $8.9 million loan relationship secured by a large development in the Branson, Missouri area \u2013 This relationship has been closely monitored on the Company\u2019s internal watch list since 2010. The development has struggled to generate necessary sales levels but has been supported through capital contributions from the individual partners in order to keep it performing as agreed. While unit sales have actually become stronger recently, the bank believes it is prudent to classify the credit as non-performing at this time. The principals continue to work with the Company to formulate a resolution. \nNon-Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) Financial Measures \nIn addition to the GAAP financial results presented in this press release, the Company presents non-GAAP financial measures discussed below. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors\u2019 overall understanding of the Company\u2019s current financial performance. Additionally, Company management believes that this presentation enables meaningful comparison of financial performance in various periods. However, the non-GAAP financial results presented should not be considered a substitute for results that are presented in a manner consistent with GAAP. A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments concern gains, losses or expenses that the Company does expect to continue to recognize; the adjustments of these items should not be construed as an inference that these gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, Company management believes that both GAAP measures of its financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together. \nOperating Income Operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts net income for the following non-operating items: Gains on sales of available-for-sale securities Gains on sales of SBA loans Losses on foreclosed assets held for sale Prepayment penalty on repurchase agreements Provision for loan loss expense Provision for income taxes \nA reconciliation of the Company\u2019s net income to its operating income for the periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 is set forth below.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. was 12.662738800048828 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Guaranty Federal Bancshares, Inc. was ",
