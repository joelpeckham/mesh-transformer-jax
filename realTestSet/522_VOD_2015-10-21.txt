This is money that could drive growth in other areas of the economy, boosting productivity. \n\"It's a $3.1 billion strain that is threatening the government's aspiration of a digital economy. \n\"That is equivalent to raising the price of fuel by 15 cents across the country.\" \nMr Berroeta said lack of money was not the problem, as regional communications receive more than $1 billion in public funding each year. \nThe issue is how the money gets spent. \nMr Berroeta slammed the government's universal service obligation (USO) scheme, which provides around $300 million of public money for fixed telephony services, mostly in regional areas. \nHe said this amounted to duplication as hundreds of millions of dollars that are already being spent on the national broadband network to develop a fixed wireless network for these same areas. \n\"I believe that the current USO scheme is outdated, unnecessary and wasteful duplication and it doesn't make sense that in the 21st Century Australia still invests on fixed telephony,\" he said. \nEarlier this month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ordered Telstra to cut the price it charges other telcos to access its copper wire network. \nThe consumer watchdog has told the telco giant to cut the price by 9.4 per cent from November 1. \nMr Berroeta welcomed the ACCC decision, saying the price reductions would encourage telcos such as Vodafone to make investments in regional Australia. \nThe company is investing in the region through the government's mobile black spot program, and plans to increase its network across most states. \nVodafone Australia expects to shift its entire network to 4G services by the first quarter of 2016. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook David Jones was unprepared: Zahra AAP \nDavid Jones was unprepared for the new world of online retail after the global financial crisis.
