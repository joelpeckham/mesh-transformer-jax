Written by: Eric Reed 07/27/15 - 3:53 PM EDT NEW YORK ( MainStreet ) -- Is America still the land of opportunity? An increasing number of people think the answer to that question might be no\u2026 and they're ready to pack up and go. \nAccording to data gathered by TransferWise , a global money transfer company, about a third of Americans say they would leave the U.S. to seek economic opportunity abroad . This snappily named \u201cAnchor Index\u201d found that the issue breaks down along unsurprising demographic lines. Most Millennials said that they would be perfectly happy to leave in search of \u201ca better quality of life\u201d elsewhere. \nIt\u2019s surprising, especially for a nation that has prided itself as the destination for immigrants across the world. From calling for \u201cyour tired, your poor, your huddled masses\u201d to today\u2019s debate about walling off Mexico, Americans have always been sure of one thing: everyone wants to get here. Now, it seems, quite a few of us are ready to leave. By the numbers: 35% of Americans would consider leaving to live elsewhere 55% of Millennials would do so 14% would be willing to drop everything and go in the next five years 58% of Americans say that they\u2019re mainly staying just for family or romantic ties \nFor some people, the lure is about finding new places and having new experiences. Indeed, an entire cottage industry of travel blogs exists around this very idea of whistling around the world on a wing and a prayer. Young people in particular are drawn to this, in what Joe Cross, general manager for TransferWise USA, called \u201ca very Millennial mindset.\u201d More Headlines\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. was 10.14285659790039 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. was ",
