The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHT Correspondent, Hindustan Times , Mumbai | Updated: Jul 16, 2015 00:18 IST \nGlobal aircraft maker Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems Ltd (TASL) have agreed to collaborate in aerospace and defence manufacturing, a move that could lead to increased domestic manufacturing for the sectors and tap the growing specialised talent pool, a theme that coincides with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s signature Make in India programme. \nThe agreement, which was signed on Thursday, will include manufacturing of potential integrated systems development opportunities such as in making unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, which have been highly effective in counter-terrorism operations and in mapping weather patterns for an agriculturally-sensitive economy like India. \nTASL already makes aero-structures for Boeing\u2019s CH-47 Chinook and AH-6i helicopters. \n\u201cThis framework agreement is the result of the world-class competencies of TASL as well as the vendor ecosystem it has establish in India,\u201d TASL chairman S Ramadorai said. \nThe Tata group company will also benefit as the deal opens up Boeing\u2019s existing global markets for products that would be developed jointly under the agreement. \nThe Centre has listed defence manufacturing as one of the key areas for increasing India\u2019s presence, and permits 49% FDI. \nThe government is expected to pitch the deal as another way to utilise India\u2019s defence engineering talent with its thrust on developing local skills. \n\u201cThe deal is significant because it demonstrates Boeing\u2019s commitment to expand its aerospace manufacturing footprint in India,\u201d said Shelley Lavender, president, Boeing Military Aircraft. \nApart from TASL, other Tata group firms, including Tata Advanced Materials and TAL Manufacturing Solutions, are also supplying components to Boeing. \n\u201cThe agreements with the US on defence would definitely benefit India, but there is still a grey area on how the collaboration can be done,\u201d said C Uday Bhaskar, director with the Society for Policy Studies.
