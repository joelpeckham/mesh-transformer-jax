Horton, Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL - news ) , Lennar, PulteGroup (NYSE: PHM - news ) and KB Home (NYSE: KBH - news ) all rose between 1 and 3 percent following the data. \n\"The good data on housing is certainly helpful since its 4 percent of the U.S. GDP,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. \n\"It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) 's something we know the Fed looks at relative to not only its impact on employment and things residual to the housing market but as well as to the wealth effect of homeowners.\" \nAt 10:59 a.m. ET (1459 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.92 points, or 0.06 percent, at 17,535.26.
