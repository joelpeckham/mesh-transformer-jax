Photo: Tim Rue/Bloomberg News By 144 COMMENTS \nTesla Motors Inc. TSLA 4.04 % \u2019s second-quarter sales jumped 52%, higher than the company had forecast, giving the Silicon Valley auto maker important momentum ahead of the debut of its Model X sport-utility later this year. \nTesla\u2019s shares rose 2% to $274.75 in morning trading following the disclosure Thursday. Tesla sold 11,507 Model S sedans for the three months that ended June 30, a company record. The global sales results were better than the 10,000 to 11,000 forecast the company had given two months ago in its first quarter earnings release . \nWhile most companies throughout the world are struggling to sell their electric cars in an environment with continued low fuel prices, Tesla has established that it is appealing to a different buyer than its competitors. \nThe company has been successful by offering a long-range electric car\u2014up to 270 miles on a charge\u2014compared with most other electric cars that are under 100 miles. In addition, the Model S can carry up to seven passengers, has sports car acceleration of 5 seconds to 60 MPH or less and has a 17-inch touch screen display that allows Web surfing. In addition, Tesla continues to add features to the car through software updates, something other car makers are only just beginning. \nTesla likely has become the biggest seller of electric vehicles in the U.S.--though the company\u2019s obscure sales reporting methods, which don\u2019t normally break out monthly or regional results, make it difficult to determine. \nIn June, Nissan Motor Co. sold 9,816 Leafs in the first six months of 2015 in the U.S. Meanwhile, Tesla sold 21,552 globally in that period. Tesla doesn\u2019t normally break out regional results, but more than half of its sales in 2014 were from the U.S. The Tesla, which starts at $76,000, is likely outselling the $28,500 Leaf. \nImportantly, the higher-than-expected sales should benefit Tesla\u2019s financial results. In the first quarter, the company burned through more than $500 million in cash and its losses widened to $154 million. Related Tesla Owners Frustrated by Recharge Waits (June 30) \nThe average Tesla sells for around $100,000 based on the company\u2019s financial reports. That means an additional 500 to 1,000 sales of Model S vehicles are the equivalent of $50 million to $100 million in revenues. \nTesla is expected to begin selling a sport-utility vehicle called the Model X in September. With thousands of reservations on hand, Tesla is expected to get a jolt in sales in the final quarter of the year. \nDan Galves, an equity analyst with Credit Suisse, correctly forecast the higher-than-expected sales in a note out earlier this week. He said the stock had \u201csubstantially more upside\u201d and raised his price target to $325 from $290. \nWrite to Mike Ramsey at michael.ramsey@wsj.com 101\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Tesla Motors, Inc. was 56.00400161743164 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Tesla Motors, Inc. was ",
