He challenged Amazon in the past with his venture, Quidsi. \nQuidsi was the parent marketplace of sites like Diapers.com and Soap.com. It grew to $300 million in annual sales of diapers and other similar items in 2010. Quidsi got Amazon\u2019s attention. Amazon slashed diaper prices by one-third. This forced Lore to sell the venture to Amazon. \nLore earned $550 million from selling Quidsi. Now, he\u2019s back in the market with a unique platform. Jet.com claims to offer the cheapest prices for Internet shopping. \nThe startup promises to offer prices that are 10%\u201315% cheaper than anywhere else on the Internet.
