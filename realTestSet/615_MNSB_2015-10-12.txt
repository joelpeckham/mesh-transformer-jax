Nobody invests to lose money, but, if you acknowledge and care about the social impact that you or a company inevitably has, and you worship at capitalism\u2019s altar, then having it both ways is more than altruism. It\u2019s a game plan. \nLast year, the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (USSIF) released its tenth report on trends along the sustainable investing axis of influence, which detailed the growth of what\u2019s nominally called ethical, green, impact, mission-driven, socially responsible or values-driven investing. Backed by USSIF\u2019s cadre of 400 mutual fund companies, banks, credit unions, pension funds and others, the report\u2019s big news wasn\u2019t that \u201cdoing good\u201d is a possibility for investors\u2014especially Millennials roundly wary of the marketplace\u2014while they aim to \u201cdo well\u201d with their money. The big news was how fully values-driven investing has been absorbed fully by conventional investment firms. \nTo wit, the report outlines some of these systemic changes such as new staff positions for senior sustainable investment professionals, so-called green bonds, fossil fuel divestment, calls to restrict investments in firearms at the policy level, pay equity among men and women doing the same work, place-based and community-focused investing and climate change. \nAmid the Sturm und Drang between opening and closing bells, this is a profound shift in the way we should think about the marketplace. And, it\u2019s being driven by the under-45 set.
