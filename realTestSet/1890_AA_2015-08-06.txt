Announces New $300 Million Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility August 06, 2015 06:10 ET | Source: CareTrust REIT \nSAN CLEMENTE, Calif., Aug. 6,   CareTrust REIT, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTRE ) announced today that it has replaced its existing secured term revolving credit facility with a new unsecured revolving credit facility. The new unsecured facility increases the Company's borrowing capacity to $300 million, doubling the $150 million capacity under its original secured credit facility. It also carries an accordion feature allowing for an additional $200 million of capacity, subject to customary terms and conditions, resulting in potential borrowing capacity of up to $500 million. \n\"For CareTrust this new unsecured credit facility, with its increased size, longer tenor and greater flexibility, not only represents a significant vote of confidence from the financial community, but more importantly better supports our immediate and long-term growth and investment objectives,\" said Greg Stapley, CareTrust's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Noting that the Company has an active and growing investment pipeline, he added, \"Best of all, the unsecured line's expanded size and ease of administration frees management to spend more time pursuing additional growth opportunities \u2013 both large and small \u2013 and allows us to do so with greater efficiency and transactional certainty.\" \nThe new unsecured revolving credit facility has a maturity date of August 5, 2019, and includes two six-month extension options. Borrowings under the unsecured facility bear interest on the outstanding principal at LIBOR plus 1.75% to 2.40% depending on total leverage, with an unused fee of 0.15% or 0.25% per annum depending on usage. In addition, if the Company's senior long-term unsecured debt receives an investment-grade rating from either S&P or Moody's, the Company may elect to further reduce the interest rate on borrowings under the credit line. \nThe new unsecured revolving credit facility was arranged by KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Raymond James Bank, NA, and BMO Capital Markets as Joint Lead Arrangers and Book Managers. KeyBank National Association is the Administrative Agent and swingline lender. Raymond James Bank, NA and BMO Capital Markets were the Co-Syndication Agents and Barclays Bank PLC and RBC Capital Markets were the Co-Documentation Agents.
