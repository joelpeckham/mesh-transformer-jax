We need to sharpen up the productivity of the company, and we need to sharpen the nature of the decision-making processes in the company, they are actually quite cumbersome,\u201d the executive chairman said. \nIf those changes are successful, then the bank could report much healthier returns for investors, which would be positive for its credit rating, according to Moody's. \n\u201cThe firm announced an additional medium-term target cost-to-income ratio in the mid-50s. The additional revenues and cost reductions needed to reach this target, if done prudently, would increase the firm\u2019s buffer against unexpected losses, a credit positive,\u201d said Mr Roccati.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Moody's Corporation was 102.62332916259766 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Moody's Corporation was ",
