It posted a disappointing second quarter Wednesday and lowered its expectations for the year. \nFactors including extreme weather and forest fires in Canada and delays at a project in Alaska weighed on its electric power business, it said. With crude now trading below $50 per barrel, energy companies are slashing capital spending, hurting Quanta's oil and gas business. \nThe Houston company also said it hasn't won as many transmission project contracts as expected this year. Competition from regional companies has been tough. Some large projects that were expected to start construction this year are being delayed into 2016. \nShares of Quanta Services Inc. fell $3.33 to $24 in midday trading. The stock is down 27 percent over the last year and is trading at its lowest prices since October 2012. \nNet income after dividends on preferred stock fell 43 percent to $46.1 million, or 22 cents per share. Revenue grew 2 percent to $1.87 billion. \nQuanta now expects to report an adjusted profit of $1.32 to $1.47 per share from continuing operations, and it is forecasting $7.5 billion to $7.7 billion in revenue. At the end of April Quanta said it expected to earn about $1.58 to $1.77 per share on $8 billion to $8.4 billion revenue excluding the fiber optic licensing business. \nAfter the market closed on Tuesday, Quanta Services Inc. completed the $1 billion sale of its fiber optic licensing business to Crown Castle International Corp. Quanta booked about $830 million in proceeds after taxes and will record a gain of 84 cents per share in the third quarter. The companies announced the deal in April. \nThe company said Wednesday it will buy back $1.25 billion in stock through the end of February 2017. It plans to start an accelerated $750 million repurchase program soon.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Quanta Services, Inc. was 26.997236251831055 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Quanta Services, Inc. was ",
