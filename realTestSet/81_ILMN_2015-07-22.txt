Optimized for use with Illumina \u00ae SeqLab, the X Edition of Clarity LIMS provides positive sample tracking, maximizes quality and throughput, and improves turnaround time in population-scale genomics workflows. The 2014 launch of the HiSeq X systems enabled labs to break the $1,000 barrier for human whole-genome sequencing. Labs are now addressing how to scale to groundbreaking throughput while maintaining a focus on quality and accuracy. The X Edition provides rapid scaling with automation and business logic built into preconfigured HiSeq X Series workflows. Samples advance through the pipeline automatically, minimizing human interaction and the potential for error while enforcing quality standards. The X Edition of Clarity LIMS was designed based upon best practices from Genomics England Lab (GEL) and the Illumina FastTrack Services Lab , and is currently in use in both labs. Clarity LIMS X Edition also provides e-signature, audit trails, and patient data security, making it suitable for regulated environments. According to Illumina Director of Scientific Research, Ryan Taft, Ph.D., \u201cClarity LIMS X closes the gap in providing a commercially available LIMS that includes out of the box instrument integration and positive sample tracking.\u201d \u201cWe are proud to partner with Illumina to provide the X Edition of Clarity LIMS for Illumina SeqLab,\u201d says Michael Ball, CEO of GenoLogics. He adds, \u201cThis solution empowers scientists and clinicians to advance the understanding of disease and accelerate the integration of genomics into everyday healthcare.\u201d About GenoLogics GenoLogics develops the industry-leading laboratory information management system (LIMS) for life sciences organizations. All Clarity LIMS editions help labs gain efficiencies and throughput with increased accuracy, fast turnaround, sample traceability, and preconfigured instrument integrations. Whether labs are regulated or unregulated, big or small, Clarity LIMS streamlines operations so that life sciences organizations can focus on advancing healthcare. In 2014, GenoLogics was independently awarded the Frost & Sullivan Customer Leadership Award in the area of Next Generation Sequencing Informatics. Founded in 2002 and privately held, GenoLogics has offices in Canada, U.S., and Europe. www.genologics.com\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Illumina, Inc. was 237.5399932861328 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Illumina, Inc. was ",
