The whole point is, banks forgot what they were there for if you only ever see things through the filter of a large corporate, you don\u2019t get a real feel, whereas if you go and sit down with a customer, they are not shy about saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like this\u201d or \u201cthere is a problem here.\u201d\u201d \nRBS is Britain\u2019s biggest lender to businesses, but its reputation has taken a series of knocks in recent years, with customers claiming compensation for interest rate swap mis-selling , and investigations into the bank\u2019s Global Restructuring Group which was accused of profiting from small firms\u2019 financial problems. \n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a long way to go in improving customer service and the trust and the advocacy,\u201d she said. \nMs Rose said she is sending all 3,500 relationship managers at the bank on a new set of training courses working on the basics of banking from credit risk through to culture and behaviour, as well as making more staff specialise in specific sectors. \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) is also taking the course, along with the executive committee. \nAnother part of that is to show customers that she is not a distant figure at head office turning down loans on a whim. \n\u201cI\u2019m quite ordinary, and I think that is quite important, that they don\u2019t think there is a big bad boss up at central office opining on their business,\u201d said Ms Rose. \nShe was speaking after the government began selling down the shares acquired in the bank bailouts of 2008 and 2009. \nChancellor George Osborne said the sale of a 5.4pc stake in the bank for \u00a32.1bn indicates it is now \u201ctime for RBS to rebuild itself as a commercial bank, no longer reliant on the state, but serving the working people of Britain.\u201d \nThe first stage of the privatisation came after the bank reported profits of \u00a3293m in the second quarter of 2015, as RBS continues to struggle with the costs of compensating customers for past mis-selling.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was 2250.0 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was ",
