Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had risen about 33 percent this year. \n(Reporting by Amrutha Gayathri in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey) Basic Materials Industry\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Valero Energy Corporation was 49.61220169067383 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Valero Energy Corporation was ",
