The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n6 photos The two wings of Fannie Mae's future headquarters will be linked. Carr Properties has followed up its application to raze the longtime Washington Post headquarters with the detailed vision for its replacement. D.C.-based Carr has filed its plans with the Board of Zoning Adjustments for an 838,480-square-foot, 12-story metal-and-glass office building in the central business district at 15th and L streets NW. Roughly 85 percent of the building will be leased by Fannie Mae , which intends to occupy the property in two phases starting in late 2017. The new building will be deemed an addition to the existing Columbia Center at 1152 15th St. NW, which Carr acquired earlier this month for $120 million. The two buildings, linked by a canopy structure as large as 4,000 square feet, combined will add up to 1.25 million square feet. Columbia Center, which delivered in 2007, was designed by Hickok Cole Architects. The addition will consist of two office lobbies and a series of retail pavilions totaling 42,000 square feet, nearly 10 times the amount of retail on the ground floor of the Post headquarters. The structure will contain 579 parking spaces on three underground levels. The building, constructed to LEED Gold standards, is described as a \"U-shaped mass that opens southward onto L Street.\" It will feature two wings, separated by a large, open and landscaped courtyard with seating and other public amenities. The architects are listed as WDG Architecture and SHoP Architects PC of New York City. The design is strikingly similar to the proposed Uber headquarters in San Francisco, also designed by SHoP. \"Above the ground level, the floors of the proposed addition will have a fuller footprint, creating the appearance as if the upper office floors are floating above the double-height retail pavilions,\" per the BZA filing. \"The facade of the upper floors will consist of a glass and metal panel curtain wall system that will be assembled at varied depths to create a distinct pattern.\" Carr acquired the Washington Post properties in March 2014 from previous Post owner Graham Holdings (NYSE: GHC) for $157.8 million, putting its total land acquisition cost \u2014 for both the Post sites and the Columbia Center \u2014 at more than $275 million. Fannie Mae is expected to move roughly 3,500 employees into the new building, consolidating down from about 1 million square feet it currently owns and leases in the District. The Washington Post will soon leave its iconic headquarters for leased space at One Franklin Square. \nWant Washington, D.C. Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox?
