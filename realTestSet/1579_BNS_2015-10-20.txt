The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n  Halifax tempts new current account and mortgage customers Moneywise \u2013 Tue, Oct 20, 2015 16:34 BST Print \nHalifax is offering extra perks to new mortgage and current account customers, in an attempt to attract new business. \nFirst-time-buyers and home movers who successfully apply for a mortgage before 6 December with Halifax will receive a \u00a3500 gift card that can be used in PC World, Currys or Knowhow. \nThe offer excludes shared equity loans, shared ownership applications and applications through intermediaries, such as mortgage brokers. Successful applicants will receive their vouchers within 30 days of completion. \nPeople opening a Halifax current account via the current account switching service before 16 January will be entered into a prize draw to win up to \u00a350,000. There are more than 200 prizes up for grabs, starting at \u00a3100. \nThis prize draw is on top of Halifax\u2019s \u00a3100 sign-up offer and reward scheme, that\u2019s worth \u00a35 a month. To receive the monthly reward, customers must stay in credit, pay in \u00a3750 a month, and make two monthly direct debit payments. \nMoneywise Verdict: Halifax\u2019s current account has one of the more generous sign up packages, and if you\u2019re looking to sign up anyway this is a nice extra. It\u2019s not a good idea to open an account just to enter the prize draw though. \nIf you\u2019re looking to open an account for the sign-up offer, also consider first direct as it pays \u00a3150 to anyone joining via moneysupermarket.com. They\u2019ll also give you another \u00a3100 if you\u2019re not happy with the service after six months. \nThe gift voucher offer is less compelling. Halifax\u2019s mortgages aren\u2019t close to the top of the best buy tables, and they\u2019ll only lend up to 85% loan-to-value, so they\u2019re not ideal for first-time buyers. You\u2019d probably save more overall by ignoring this and going with a broker\u2019s recommendation.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank Nova Scotia Halifax Pfd 3 was 34.91371154785156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank Nova Scotia Halifax Pfd 3 was ",
