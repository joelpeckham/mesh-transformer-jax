In an environment of slower growth, investors are likely to continue to favor companies that can demonstrate higher growth profiles, and valuations are more attractive here for growth equities on a normalized basis looking back 15 years, according to Schwarz. \n\"We still think valuations for growth companies and growth mutual funds are more attractive than their growth counterparts,\" said Schwarz. \"We think at this stage at the economic cycle growth companies will do better.\" \nWithin their 40% fixed-income exposure, investors should opt for high-quality bonds , as opposed to stretching for yield and adding risk in this environment. He said the diversification benefit of Treasuries has diminished because yields are so low and inflation and growth have deteriorated. If there is a liquidity crisis in bonds, equities will likely do worse, according to Schwarz. \nFinally, for investors who need to add risk, Schwarz said he prefers high-yield bonds to stocks. Nevertheless, because of his economic concerns, he does not suggest that investors load up too much on high yield either. \n\"We like high yield right now as a replacement to equity risk,\" said Schwarz. \"But we want to get paid some yield to be there.\"\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Union Pacific Corporation was 84.54332733154297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Union Pacific Corporation was ",
