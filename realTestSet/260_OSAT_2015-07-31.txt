PUBLISHED: 16:00, Fri, Jul 31, 2015 | UPDATED: 16:31, Fri, Jul 31, 2015 GETTY NatWest users are having problems with their accounts \nAffected customers went online to complain that they couldn't get on to accounts online or through apps this morning and that expected payments had not reached their accounts. \nUsers were told that the bank was investigating problems and apologised for the inconvenience. \nBut the group, which includes Ulster brands, has now confirmed that the disruption had been the result of a cyber assault.An unknown source brought the bank's system to its knees, by flooding the website with traffic in a so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. \nNatWest and RBS systems are now back up and running and the bank has moved to make assurances that customer details or accounts were not put at risk. \nA spokesperson said: \"The issues that some customers experienced accessing online banking this morning was due to a surge in internet traffic deliberately directed at the website. \n\"At no time was there any risk to customers. \n\"Customers experienced issues for around 50 minutes and this has now been resolved. \n\"We apologise for the inconvenience caused.\" \nAfter the attack, users who were still experiencing problems were advised that deleting and re-installing the app should help to resolve remaining issues. \nExperts said that the attack could have been the result of someone who holds a grudge with the company.

On payday of all days. Your systems are useless and frustrating!\" Can't access online banking or withdraw?
