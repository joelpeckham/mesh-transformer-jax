The movement higher came after the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) increased the reference rate for the first time since the central bank implemented a new fixing policy . The increase was by 0.05 percent which brought the Yuan reference rate to 6.3975 against the US Dollar. Thursday\u2019s fix was a 1.1 percent reduction with the USDCNH rising more than 0.4 percent. Yesterday the PBOC announced that the Yuan exchange rate adjustment is almost complete. Indeed the central bank followed through with this. By far, today\u2019s fix was the least dramatic as the previous 3 were a cut by more than a full percentage point. Looking at overnight S&P 500 trade (in CFDs and futures) , the index climbed more than 0.1 percent after the announcement. It appears the market\u2019s response to China\u2019s new policy continues to taper. \nDailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets.Learn forex trading with a free practice account and trading charts from FXCM . @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Related Headlines\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was 6.400000095367432 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was ",
