David brings a wealth of technology and start up experience, which will undoubtedly enhance and accelerate the advancement of the rVue platform. \n\"David and I have been in discussions for nearly 18 months and looking for the right time to bring him and InstantSys on board. That time is now.\" \nInstantSys also provides rVue with a bench of experts and support... technology specialists needed to continue our progress without adding significant fixed costs. \nDavid added: \"rVue has a strong team of uniquely qualified technology experts who have been with the company from the early days, as well as a robust technology foundation. The InstantSys team and I are excited to work with the team in further enhancing the platform and extending rVue's lead. The digital place based media category shares the characteristics of early internet/mobile banner and video ad offerings, with few standards, decentralized buying processes, and initially limited attention as a media category, but as the industry matures it also shares the same tremendous upside potential. It's clear that digital place based media will take its place alongside TV, print, and internet/mobile as a major category of advertising spend. I look forward to helping rVue realize that potential.\" \nConference Call Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 4:30 p.m. ET, today, August 13, 2015. \nDetails are as follows:\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Alcoa Inc. was 22.412723541259766 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Alcoa Inc. was ",
