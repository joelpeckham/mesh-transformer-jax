The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nView Photo \n\nThe Reserve Bank is expected to look through recent market turmoil and keep the cash rate unchanged for the foreseeable future. \nAll 16 economists surveyed by AAP expect the RBA to keep the cash rate unchanged at its September meeting on Tuesday, and only three expect another cut before the middle of next year. \nThe central bank cut its interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point in February and again in May, taking the cash rate to a new record low of two per cent. \nEarly this week, the Chinese sharemarket suffered falls of seven and eight per cent on the back of concerns about its economy, which sparked losses in markets around the world. \nThe futures market responded by betting on an increased chance of an RBA cash rate cut, with pricing for a September reduction going as high as 16 per cent from six per cent last week. \nA rate cut in February is fully priced in and more bets have been placed on cuts for other months. \nDespite this, JP Morgan Australia chief economist Stephen Walters doubts the RBA's interest rate stance has changed much since the August meeting. \n\"RBA officials are not known for jumping at the first appearance of shadows,\" he said. \n\"The main focus, then, most likely will be on the bank's commentary. \n\"There inevitably will be nods towards recent developments to our north and to the volatility in markets.\" \nMr Walters said that the RBA, while staying alert to any serious shocks from China, will shrug off short term market volatility and focus on the performance of the Australian economy. \n\"The economy still is growing at a disappointing rate, but labour market outcomes have been decent enough,\" he said. \nAMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said the RBA's focus will be on the slowly improving Australian economy. \n\"The RBA is expected to leave interest rates on hold consistent with its assessment that recent Australian economic data has been a bit better and unemployment a bit lower than previously expected,\" he said. \n\"However, of most interest will be any comments regarding recent financial market turbulence in relation to China/emerging market driven worries and in particular whether this suggests a strengthened easing bias.\" \nDr Oliver said the falling Australian dollar will also encourage the central bank to keep the cash rate unchanged. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook RBA unlikely to change rate stance AAP \nThe Reserve Bank is expected to look through recent market turmoil and keep the cash rate unchanged for the foreseeable \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ritchie Bros.
