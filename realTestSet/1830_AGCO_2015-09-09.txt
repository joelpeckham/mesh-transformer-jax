In addition, both parties look forward to expanding the cooperation in rural finance and other areas. \n\u201cWe are entering a global phase of the \u2018Internet Plus\u2019 age. The merging of internet and traditional industries is set to go deeper still and will lead to the creation of new development formats,\u201d said Mr. Collar. \u201cAgriculture as a primary industry will certainly be one of the key forces to drive the economic transition and accelerate this revolutionary innovation in the industrial model.\u201d \nThe MOU objectives are aligned with government policy for the development of the agricultural sector in China. According to the \u2018Made in China 2025\u2019 initiative, approved by China\u2019s State Council in March, the agricultural machinery industry is one of several industry sectors that will be prioritized under its \u201cintelligent manufacturing program.\u201d This will draw on information technology, data technology and the Internet of Things in the design, processing, testing and assembly of agricultural machines. The Chinese government made clear its intention to prioritize investment in agricultural and rural areas, develop the pilot-financing and rental projects for large-sized agricultural machinery, strongly encourage agricultural machinery leasing and press forward with the reform of rural financing systems. \n\u201cThis strong strategic cooperation between AGCO and Alibaba happens in the context of economic development and is a pioneering act in the agriculture machinery industry,\u201d said Mr. Yang of AGCO China. \u201cAs a responsible international company and with the favorable policies of the Chinese government, AGCO is looking to adapt and promote the merging of modern agriculture with mobile internet, big data, cloud computing and the Internet of Things, and to stimulate innovation in modern agricultural production, new business patterns and industry models. Meanwhile, AGCO will further enhance our production quality, sales efficiency and service so that our product information and services can reach our customers in a more timely and complete manner.\u201d \n\u201cChina is entering an explosive growth period in information consumption industries. It is estimated by 2015 the amount will exceed 3,200 billion yuan, an increase of over 20% compared to 2014,\u201d said Mr. Yu of Rural Taobao. \u201cWe are honored to join hands with AGCO Corporation to bring world-class agricultural machinery to rural villagers across China, along with other areas of collaboration.
