The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n17.39 -0.12 \nThe Cashback Reward account from Natwest   offers decent cashback - but how does it rate? \nOnce it was all about cashback on credit cards. Now   battle between banks is about offering \"free\" money on spending from current accounts. \nThe latest bank to offer cashback is NatWest. Its new Cashback Reward account, launched this week, offers 3pc cashback on household outgoings, including council tax, electricity, gas and even phone and television bills. \nAccount holders must pay a charge of \u00a33 per month or \u00a336 per year. NatWest say that after accounting for the annual fee, the average customer will earn \u00a390 a year. \n= Verdict = \nThere's no doubt it's an attractive deal, but it depends on how much you spend, and also whether you have savings. \nWe explain more on that below. First (Other OTC: FSTC - news ) , let's crunch the numbers. \nIf a customer held the Natwest-RBS Cashback Reward account and spent \u00a31,400 a year on council tax, \u00a3400 a year on water and \u00a31,100 on gas and electricity as well as \u00a31,000 on broadband, TV and phone bills, they would earn a straight 3pc of \u00a3114. Minus the fee, they\u2019re left with \u00a378. The overdraft interest is high at 19.89pc plus \u00a36 a month, which would cancel out any benefits if used. \n\u2022 Our five favourite cashback reward current accounts \u2022 What is the Personal Savings Allowance? \nThe rival 123 account from Santander* pays 1pc on water and council tax, 2pc on gas and electricity and 3pc on phone, broadband and TV packages. \nBased on the above figures, customers could expect to earn \u00a346 after the annual fee. \nHowever, this account also pays 3pc on balances between \u00a33,000 and \u00a320,000, which generates a maximum interest of \u00a3592 after tax. \nOther options include the Halifax Reward Current* account that pays a \u00a3125 switching incentive, as well as \u00a35 a month loyalty payment if customers can pay in \u00a3750 and set up two direct debits. This could pay customers \u00a3185 per year, although a \u00a35 a day overdraft fee could quickly cancel this out. \nFor customers who want to earn a high rate of interest, TSB\u2019s Current Plus* current account pays 5pc on balances up to \u00a32,000, plus 5pc cashback on the first \u00a3100 spent each month on a contactless debit card. \nRachel Springall of Moneyfacts, which analyses financial products, said these kind of accounts are great payers, so long as account holders make sure they keep on top of their bills. She (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) suggested organised customers open up a cashback account alongside their main current account to take advantage of the rewards. \nHowever, in the current competitive climate, she also advised customers to keep an eye out for banks offering attractive switching incentives. \nShe said: \u201cBanks can up their account fees at anytime, so long as they notify their customers, so if existing customers are no longer happy with their deal, they should look to using the Switcher Guarantee Service and move to a more competitive account in as quick as seven days.\u201d \n\u2022 The best of Telegraph Money: get our weekly newsletter \n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of NatWest Group plc was 7.829361915588379 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of NatWest Group plc was ",
