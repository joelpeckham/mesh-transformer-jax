The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n33.37 -0.32 \nThe FTSE 100 pharmaceutical giant has en exciting pipeline of cancer drugs which could finally end the revenue decline from the patent cliff, says Questor \nAstraZeneca (Swiss: AZN.SW - news ) \u00a341.67 Questor says BUY \nThe C word \nWhen it comes to discovering drugs to treat the many different forms of cancer, AstraZeneca [LON:AZN] is one of the world\u2019s leaders. \nThe FTSE 100-listed company has developed breakthrough immuno-oncology treatments that use the body\u2019s own immune system to recognise and destroy cancer cells. \nThis technology is being combined with a greater understanding of the human genetic code to identify people who will respond better to certain types of treatment. \nAnalysts from broker Berenberg believe ovarian cancer treatment Lynparza, and lung cancer drugs AZD9291 and MEDI4736 could see their sales double from 2017 onwards from about $2.8bn (\u00a31.8bn), or 12pc of the group total, to about $7bn, or a quarter of total sales. \n= Mind the cliff = \nBig pharmaceutical groups such as AstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) are still suffering from patents running out on blockbuster drugs, and cheaper, rival copies are being made. \nThe so-called \u201cpatent cliff\u201d damages sales and lowers the profits on drugs. \nThe biggest for AstraZeneca has been around its blockbuster cholesterol treatment, Crestor, which generates about a fifth of sales for the company. \nThe good news is that analysts now believe that the worst of the sharp fall in revenues and profits should be coming to an end. \n= The investment case = \nThe shares are interesting because AstraZeneca\u2019s sales and profits are close to reaching a tipping point. \nThe long decline in revenue will reach its nadir in 2016 and analysts from Berenberg believe earnings can grow at 13pc a year for the six-year period from 2017 onwards. \nThe profit margin is also expected to reach its lowest point at about 26pc in 2016, and then recover steadily to the sector average of about 35pc by 2023. \nInvestors may think that if the recovery is still more than a year away then it is safer to wait until later next year to buy the shares. \nHowever, stock markets price today based on the forecast revenue and profits up to a year away. \nTherefore any signs that AstraZeneca is improving its trading and making progress with its cancer drugs will see the shares rise sharply. Those who wait too long will see any gains eroded. \n= Buying opportunity = \nThe shares have drifted to a 12-month low after the possible takeover from US rival Pfizer (NYSE: PFE - news ) has gone away. \nThey are now trading on 15 times forecast earnings and offer a 4.4pc prospective dividend yield. \nAnalysts from Berenberg calculate that, once the market wakes up to the value of the new cancer drugs, the shares will be worth \u00a352 each, which means gains of \u00a311 per share. \nQuestor also likes getting paid \u00a31.80 in dividends every year to wait.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Astrazeneca PLC was 25.881004333496094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Astrazeneca PLC was ",
