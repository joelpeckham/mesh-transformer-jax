The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nContent preferences Done General Motors Company GM is set to report second-quarter 2015 results on Jul 23. In the last quarter, the company posted a negative 11.34% earnings surprise. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors Influencing this Quarter General Motors is focusing on the emerging markets, particularly Brazil, China and India, to enhance its global sales by increasing capacity investment to meet the growing demand. The company is focused on the Chinese market, which is expected to become the world\u2019s largest luxury vehicle market, later this decade. All these factors should drive the second-quarter results of the company.However, General Motors is facing a challenging situation in Russia on account of declining sales owing to a weak economy. Meanwhile, Venezuela is facing challenges on account of low oil prices and currency controls which have led to a decline in the value of dollar in South America. General Motors is expected to incur a pre-tax charge of $600 million in the second quarter due to the impact of devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that General Motors is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Zacks ESP : Earnings ESP for General Motors is -2.78% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.05, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08. Zacks Rank: General Motors carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company\u2019s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.
