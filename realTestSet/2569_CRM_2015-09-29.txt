But we recognise that it is the SFO\u2019s investigation and it would be inappropriate for the Bank to comment further on the matter at the present time.\u201d \nThe SFO declined to comment. \nThe SFO launched its investigation earlier this year after it was handed the results of an inquiry conducted in 2014 by Lord Grabiner into whether any senior staff at the Bank were aware its auctions may have been rigged in 2007 and 2008. \nDuring that time the Bank lent money against low and negative interest rates in return for asset-backed securities, in a bid to keep lending markets open as the credit crunch struck. \nThe Bank had commissioned that probe, and subsequently handed the results to the SFO late last year. \nThe Bank revealed to a Treasury select committee in March that it had given the Financial Conduct Authority dozens of instances of possible market rigging since bringing in new whistleblowing rules in the wake of the foreign exchange scandal. \nMark Carney, the Bank's governor, told MPs that the central bank had uncovered 50 instances of market manipulation and that 42 of these had been handed to the City watchdog, which is investigating several of them. \nAndrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said at the time: \u201cThe Bank referred this to the Serious Fraud Office when Lord Grabiner\u2019s initial findings were made clear to them. This was the right thing to do. I was informed about the referral on November 21, 2014. \n\u201cWe must now await the outcome of the SFO\u2019s work. The sooner their findings are published the better.\u201d \nMr Carney admitted that Threadneedle Street\u2019s reputation had \u201ctaken a knock\u201d over the scandal, which drew in the Bank when allegations emerged that it had known about rigging. \nDuring that session in front of MPs, Mr Carney agreed that before the forex scandal emerged, the institution\u2019s rules on raising the alarm about possible market rigging had been unclear, but said the Bank had introduced new policies since. \nThe Bank has brought in an \u201cattestation and escalation policy\u201d to encourage intelligence staff suspecting market manipulation to come forward. \nAn independent report published last year into the scandal reserved its criticism largely to Martin Mallett, the Bank\u2019s former chief currency trader, saying he should have told his superiors about his concerns. \nWhen traders at major banks were rigging foreign exchange rates, Mr Mallett developed concerns about manipulation, several years before the scandal became public. \nLord Grabiner, the barrister who carried out the report, criticised him for failing to escalate concerns, but also said the Bank needed a proper \u201cescalation policy\u201d to make sure that staff are able to raise the alarm. \nMr Mallett was fired over unrelated conduct issues , which Mr Carney later revealed amounted to more than 20 violations of Bank rules, including \u201csharing a confidential bank document, venturing personal opinions about Bank policy\u2026 inappropriate language, inappropriate attachments to emails\u2026 incidents that could have brought the bank\u2019s reputation into dispute\u201d. \nMr Carney also said the revelations about the institution\u2019s place in the scandal \u201chasn\u2019t been a pleasant experience\u201d, but that \u201cthe test of the organisation is how it responds to this\u2026 what\u2019s critical are the changes to policies and procedures [we have put in place]\u201d. \nLord Grabiner\u2019s report, whose credibility has been questioned by MPs, was published in November 2014, on the same day that six banks were fined a combined \u00a32.7bn for allowing traders to rig foreign exchange benchmarks. \nChancellor George Osborne has told the SFO it would be given a blank cheque to investigate wrongdoing.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Salesforce.com Inc was 69.04000091552734 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Salesforce.com Inc was ",
