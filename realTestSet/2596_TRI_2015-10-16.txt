Still, investments \nmade in recent years, such as the Golden Eagle (HKSE: 3308-OL.HK - news ) project which \nstarted up in 2014, are helping to expand supplies. \nOutput of the four crudes that set the Brent benchmark - \nBrent itself, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk - is still set to be \nhigher in November despite planned maintenance on the Buzzard \noilfield, the largest field contributing to the Forties stream. \nThe table below is based on the latest known loading \nprogrammes for 12 crude streams as tracked by Reuters. \nVolumes are in millions of barrels and loading rates are in \nbarrels per day.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was 35.916748046875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was ",
