We have an enviably stable business with balanced books and the right strategy to return us to sales growth.\u201d \nAlex Russo, Asda's chief financial officer, said that profits at the supermarket were flat in the second quarter, compared to profit declines at the other big UK supermarkets. \n\u201cBehind the negative sales number lies a more positive story for Asda,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are maintaining balance in an impulsive market and performing solidly in growth channels, maximising and accelerating our areas of strength while addressing areas of underperformance.\u201d \nAsda has been battling Sainsbury (Amsterdam: SJ6.AS - news ) 's for the title of the UK's second biggest supermarket ; it currently holds a 16.4pc share of the grocery market, compared with Sainsbury's on 16.5pc and Tesco on 28.5pc. \nThe 'big four' supermarkets - a group that also includes Morrisons - have been battling competition from discount grocers Aldi and Lidl, forcing them to make extensive price cuts . Asda began a five-year plan in 2013 to slash prices by \u00a31bn. \n\u201cWe remain firmly committed to narrowing the price gap to the discounters,\u201d Mr Clarke said on Tuesday. \nSeperately, Wal-Mart reported second-quarter earnings that missed analysts\u2019 estimates after currency fluctuations and spending on employee pay rises dragged down profit. \n\u2022 Wal-Mart raises minimum pay.
