The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nwww.robbinsarroyo.com/shareholders-rights-blog/idi-inc IDI, Inc. Fails to Disclose Information About Pending Lawsuits \nAccording to the complaint, IDI officials failed to disclose adverse information concerning Michael Brauser, who was elected to IDI's board on June 2, 2015, and became Executive Chairman of the company on June 16, 2015. On April 30, 2015, IDI filed a proxy statement with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission in connection with its annual shareholders meeting to elect members of its Board of Directors. The proxy statement, which included biographical information about Brauser as a director nominee, failed to disclose that Brauser was named as a defendant in various civil fraud litigation, was co-owner of a telecommunications firm that filed for bankruptcy, and was sued in an adversary proceeding related to that firm. \nThe complaint further alleges that the disclosure of the company's legal proceedings in its 2015 Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2015, was incomplete and misleading. The 10-Q mentioned that the company was being sued by TransUnion Risk and Alternative Data Solutions, Inc., but failed to disclose that an adverse ruling could have an immediate near-term impact on the company's financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. \nOn July 21, 2015, Seekingalpha.com published an article detailing Brauser's involvement in multiple lawsuits and stating that IDI's TransUnion lawsuit could render IDI's stock worthless. The same day, the company's stock fell $5.26 per share, or over 46%, to close at $6.16 per share. IDI, Inc.
