They are asking to EPA to stick to the Bank of Ghana\u2019s directive for local services to be priced in the local currency. \nStory by Ghana/Joy Business\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of EPAM Systems, Inc. was 67.94000244140625 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of EPAM Systems, Inc. was ",
