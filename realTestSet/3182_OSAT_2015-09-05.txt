Neither the FHFA nor RBS responded to requests for comment. \nThe case was the first to reach trial of the 18 lawsuits the FHFA had filed in 2011 over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that banks sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nBefore that, the FHFA obtained nearly $17.9 billion in settlements from institutions that include Bank of America Corp , JPMorgan Chase & Co (Xetra: 850628 - news ) and Deutsche Bank AG (Other OTC: DBAGF - news ) . \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was unclear how much of the $33 million reflected the FHFA's overall costs in litigating against Nomura. The regulator had hired a private law firm, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, for the lawsuit. \nIn July, the FHFA disclosed that it had paid nearly $373.5 million to two law firms including Quinn Emanuel from 2010 through Feb. 6 of this year, when Reuters submitted a Freedom of Information Act request. \nThe case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v Nomura Holding America Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06201. \n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Chris Reese)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was 1822.5 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was ",
