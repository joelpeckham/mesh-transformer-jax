The home loan market is dynamic, with multiple changes being seen across the industry,\" NAB group executive for personal banking Gavin Slater said. \n\"Today's decision has not been easy, but we believe this is right decision for the long term.\" \nNAB's move fuels further speculation of a Melbourne Cup Day rate cut by the Reserve Bank next month. \nTreasurer Scott Morrison said banks were entitled to make their own commercial decisions. \n\"That is entirely a matter for them to explain to their customers about why they're doing this,\" Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Friday. \n\"There's no mandatory requirement on behalf of the government to pass on costs to consumers. \n\"At the end of the day, customers can choose where they want to bank and shop and buy their milk.\" @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook CBA joins Westpac in hiking interest rates AAP \nMore Australian home owners will be hit with higher mortgage rates with expectations two of Australia's big banks \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Westpac Banking Corporation was 15.966226577758789 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Westpac Banking Corporation was ",
