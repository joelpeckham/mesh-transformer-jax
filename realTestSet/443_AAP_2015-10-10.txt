The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSat, Oct 10, 2015, 1:30 PM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Economists interpret RBA, housing finance AAP \u2013 1 hour 50 minutes ago Recommend Print \nThe big event for economists this week was the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision on interest rates. \nThe decision to keep the cash rate at 2.0 per cent was well anticipated, Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird said. \n\"As such, the focus was on the Governor's accompanying statement which turned out to be basically a carbon copy of last month's statement.\" \nHe pointed out the lack of any comments suggesting the need for a lower Australian dollar, which Mr Aird said is presently trading \"in the RBA's comfort zone\". \n\"It's fallen enough to help the Australian economy rebalance without posing a risk to the near term inflation outlook.\" \nThe case for leaving rates on hold is stronger than the case for a cut, despite market pricing suggesting a 50-50 change of a cut this year, Mr Aird said. \n\"The RBA would need to downgrade their growth forecasts in the November Statement on Monetary Policy to justify a rate cut and in our view that looks unlikely.\" \nTaking a somewhat gloomier view of the economic outlook, ANZ economist Felicity Emmett reiterated the ANZ's view that the RBA will cut the cash rate from 2.0 per cent to 1.5 per cent in two moves in the first half of 2016. \nThe latest figures suggest the Australian economy \"is still trudging along\", she said. \n\"Our own view is that this is likely to continue for a while, but next year's growth could deteriorate as the boost from housing starts to fade, and the impact of the lower AUD on services trade lessens. \nAnd that means growth will be unlikely to be strong enough to the unemployment rate rising from an already elevated rate - something we think the RBA would feel particularly uncomfortable about, Ms Emmett said. \nThe week was rounded of with the ABS estimates of housing finance approvals, which showed a 5.2 per cent rise in the number of owner-occupier loans (8.8 per cent in dollar terms), aside from refinancing deals. \nAt the same time, the value of investor loans edged down marginally, the seasonally adjusted figures showed, suggesting the finger-wagging and stern memos from Australian Prudential Regulation Authority were having the desired effect. \n\"Annual investor mortgage flows (value terms) continue to decelerate, the result of increased oversight by Australian regulators,\" JP Morgan's Tom Kennedy said in a report on the data. \nBut economic figures are never clear cut, leading Royal Bank of Canada's Michael Turner to sound a note of caution. \nThe figures did suggest the measures were making a difference. \n\"However, the data may be somewhat distorted by the price incentive for borrowers now to have loans classified as owner-occupier rather than investor,\" Mr Turner said. \n\"The spike in the value of approvals for owner-occupiers (ex-refinancing) in the month argues for caution when interpreting the data.\"   IMF's 'credibility' at stake in reform row: Lagarde AFP \nWashington's use of its de facto veto at the International Monetary Fund to block reforms giving emerging countries \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Advance Auto Parts Inc was 183.83468627929688 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Advance Auto Parts Inc was ",
