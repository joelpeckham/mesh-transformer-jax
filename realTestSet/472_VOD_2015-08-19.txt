That P3 research measured parameters including call set-up, speech quality as well as downloads and uploads speed. \nCommenting on the NCA findings, Gayheart Mensah, Director of External Affairs at Vodafone Ghana said: \n\u201cWe welcome the findings from the NCA which has shown a consistency with the recent independent endorsement by P3 which ranked Vodafone best in voice clarity and internet speed. The bedrock of any telecommunication company is the quality of its network. As the terrain continues to be competitive, we need to take our customer commitment to the next level and we will never renege on this\u201d. \nThe NCA\u2019s QoS test are carried out in various localities and the results are often based on a lot of factors including the perspective of users in that particular region. \nVodafone launched a network campaign a couple of months ago, claiming the best in voice quality and 3G Internet speed. The television and radio commercials and indeed the entire campaign have received rave reviews from different segments of society.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Vodafone Group Plc was 25.751420974731445 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Vodafone Group Plc was ",
