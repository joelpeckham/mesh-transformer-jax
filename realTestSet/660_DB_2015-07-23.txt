He insisted he\u2019ll do everything he can to improve the final deal. \n\u201cConservative forces within Europe still insist on their plans to kick Greece out of the euro,\u201d Tsipras told legislators in the early hours of Thursday. \u201cWe chose a compromise that forces us to implement a program we don\u2019t believe in and we will implement it, because the choices we have are tough.\u201d \nThe prime minister is trying to hold together his ad hoc majority long enough to finalize the 86 billion-euro ($93 billion) bailout program the country needs to stave off financial collapse. Abandoned by party hardliners, Tsipras is reliant on his political opponents to deliver the measures that creditors have demanded. \nThe new banking rules will, in theory, shield taxpayers from the cost of bank failures and stipulate that unsecured depositors -- those with more than 100,000 euros with an individual bank -- will face losses before the public purse. Shareholders, senior and junior creditors will be in line to take a hit before depositors. \nHowever, the law won\u2019t come into effect until the start of 2016 and Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos told lawmakers that banks will already have been recapitalized by then. Greek lenders are in line for as much as 25 billion euros of new capital under the outline terms of the new bailout program.
