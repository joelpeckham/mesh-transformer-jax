The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTuesday, September 29, 2015 6:46PM IST (1:16PM GMT) New $20 Million XPRIZE Aims to Tackle CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuels Global Competition Challenges Innovators to Develop Breakthrough Technologies to Convert CO2 into Valuable Products Austin, Texas, United States At Fortune \u2019s Brainstorm E conference today, XPRIZE Chairman and CEO Peter Diamandis announces the $20M NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE , a competition to address CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels. With registration opening today, teams are challenged to develop breakthrough technologies that convert the most CO 2 into one or more products with the highest net value. Co-sponsored by NRG and COSIA, the 4-\u00bd year competition will include two tracks, with the new technologies tested at either a coal power plant or a natural gas facility. \u201cWe are living in an age of unprecedented technological progress and prosperity driven by energy,\u201d said Diamandis. \u201cYet, most of this energy comes from burning fossil fuels, a leading contributor to climate change. We are embarking on one urgent step in XPRIZE\u2019s energy roadmap of incentivizing a clean and positive energy future that addresses a suite of Grand Challenges.\u201d According to the International Energy Agency, 82 percent of the world\u2019s energy supply is derived from fossil fuels. While cleaner energy sources are on the rise, overall energy demand is expected to grow 37 percent by 2040, making immediate carbon mitigation solutions even more urgent. Few challenges are greater or more critical than ensuring access to clean, affordable and abundant energy. As CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels continue to be a leading contributor to climate change, the Carbon XPRIZE will address global CO 2 emissions by incentivizing solutions to convert CO 2 from a liability into an asset. The Carbon XPRIZE will incentivize breakthrough technologies that convert CO 2 into a product or suite of products such as: alternative cement, concrete, and other building materials; chemicals used to manufacture a variety of industrial and consumer goods; low-carbon transportation fuels; and possibly new products altogether. \u201cCarbon is a unique challenge in that as we move toward a low to zero-emission future, we\u2019ll need to continue using fossil fuels to meet current energy demands,\u201d said Sicily Dickenson, chief marketing officer, NRG. \u201cWe\u2019re using the highly effective XPRIZE process to engage the world\u2019s brightest minds to find a solution that helps solve emissions problems, and simultaneously creates viable products that we use every day.\u201d \u201cWe know that CO 2 emissions contribute to climate change so we\u2019re continually working to improve our environmental performance in the oil sands,\u201d said Dan Wicklum, COSIA chief executive. \u201cThis competition will be a catalyst to accelerate our progress towards a cleaner global energy future by converting CO 2 emissions into valuable products. A team may win the money, butour energy future will win the prize.\u201d XPRIZE will appoint a judging panel to evaluate the various technologies and approaches developed by teams during the competition. XPRIZE will also appoint a third-party Scientific Advisory Board of experts available to advise on a variety of approaches to CO 2 conversion. The Carbon XPRIZE is a part of XPRIZE\u2019s growing portfolio of Energy & Environment prizes and long-term vision for accelerating revolutionary energy technologies to help move the world towards a clean, abundant energy future.
