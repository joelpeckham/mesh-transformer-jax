The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUSA Compression Partners\u2019 Leverage and Its Recent Public Offering By Ruth King 1 hour ago \ue071 \n( Continued from Prior Part ) USAC\u2019s leverage \nUSA Compression Partners\u2019 (USAC) ratio of total debt to its annualized quarterly adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is 4.9x. The ratio increased from 4.8x in 1Q15 and 4.2x in 2Q14. \nThe debt-to-EBITDA ratio is often used to assess a company\u2019s ability to repay debt. Credit rating agencies commonly use the metric to determine a company\u2019s credit rating. A lower ratio is considered better from a credit perspective. A higher debt-to-EBITDA ratio increases the possibility of a default on scheduled repayments. \nMLPs generally target a ratio of below 4x. Exterran Partners\u2019 (EXLP) ratio of total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA is 4.6x. CSI Compressco\u2019s (CCLP) ratio is 3.9x. So, USAC\u2019s debt-to-EBITDA ratio is on the higher side in comparison. USAC forms 2.5% of the Yorkville High Income MLP ETF (YMLP). \nDebt-to-EBITDA ratios for oilfield services MLPs Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP) and Seadrill Partners (SDLP) are 1.7x and 4.3x, respectively. In comparison, the ratio for midstream MLP Martin Midstream Partners (MMLP) is 5.3x. \nThe above graph shows USA Compression Partners\u2019 debt-to-EBITDA ratio since its listing. It has been rising since the second quarter of 2014, but has remained below 5x over the last ten quarters. USAC had executed a $138 million follow-on primary offering in the first quarter of 2014. The proceeds were used to repay debt, which resulted in a drop in debt-to-EBITDA level from 5x in 1Q14 to 4.2x in 2Q14. USAC\u2019s recent public offering \nOn September 9, 2015, USA Compression Partners announced a public offering of 4 million common units. The MLP plans to use part of the proceeds to repay debt. As discussed above, the MLP has an elevated debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.9x. This will likely reduce its leverage levels, as the elevated ratio happened after its previous offering in the first half of 2014. \nNext, we\u2019ll take a look at USAC\u2019s planned capital expenditure and its growth over time.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of USA Compression Partners, LP was 7.755713939666748 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of USA Compression Partners, LP was ",
