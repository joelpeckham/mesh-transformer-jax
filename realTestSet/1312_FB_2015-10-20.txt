All decisions are subject to the laws of Ireland and European laws,\" he told AFP. \nHe added: \"There's a significant economic benefit to the country having these companies here and we're more than happy to provide adequate first class regulation.\" \nBut there is no doubt the DPC favours a collaborative rather than combative approach to regulation. \n\"The office proactively engages with industry, helping to shape how companies work with data, rather than simply watching for transgressions,\" a DPC spokeswoman told AFP in an emailed statement. \nSchrems said: \"The idea that being friendly with companies is going to help is just childish.\"\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Facebook, Inc. was 98.47000122070312 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Facebook, Inc. was ",
