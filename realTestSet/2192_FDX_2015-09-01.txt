The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGold Prices Find Support, Attempt to Launch Recovery Anew Move Higher Looks Corrective Within Long-Term Down Trend Gol d prices are attempting to return to the offensive having found support after recoiling from resistance capping gains since mid-May. A daily close above resistance at 1138.14, the 23.6% Fibonacci expansion, initially exposes the 14.6% level at 1150.24. On the other hand, a turn back lower that takes out the 38.2% Fib at 1118.52 opens the door for a test of the 50% expansion at 1102.66. On balance, the dominant long-term trend has favored the downside since consolidation gave way to sustained selling pressure in October 2012. With that in mind, even a sustained near-term push upward higher that clears trend line resistance \u2013 thereby clearing the way for a larger advance \u2013 is likely to appear corrective in the context of a larger decline. Disturbing the multi-year bearish bias would require a weekly close above $1250.
