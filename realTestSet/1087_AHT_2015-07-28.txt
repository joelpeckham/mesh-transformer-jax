Photo: Ford Motor/Reuters By 45 COMMENTS \nLooking to test the upper limits of what U.S. customers will pay for a pickup truck, Ford Motor Co. F 1.11 % later this year will launch a new version of its best-selling F-150 with one of the highest price tags ever attached to its workhorse truck. \nWith features including \u201cfiddleback eucalyptus\u201d wood trim, massaging seats and panoramic roofs, the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker\u2019s coming F-150 Limited model will start about $60,000, a larger starting price than a Porsche Cayenne sport-utility vehicle. \nIndustry experts say buyers for this class of uber-trucks tend to be blue-collar entrepreneurs who have the money and desire to flaunt their rides. Some have traded in German luxury cars and want the same leather, electronics and luxury appointments in a pickup, dealers say. \nOverall, the share of $50,000 and up pickup trucks sold in the U.S. has more than doubled in the last five years, climbing from 9% in 2010 to 22% this year, according to car-pricing research firm Kelley Blue Book. \nFord has seen its mix of $50,000-plus pickup sales increase to 30% in 2015, up from 13% five years ago, while at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCAU -4.88 % NV, the mix is about 21%, up from 10% in 2010, according to KBB. \nAt General Motors Co. GM -0.03 % , the No. 2 pickup seller with the Chevrolet brand, its share of pickups selling for more than $50,000 has jumped from 6% in 2010 to 26% this year, the research firm estimates, a trend bolstered by the popularity of its more premium GMC lineup. \n\u201cWe really have a truck that is so versatile it is attracting the high-end luxury car buyer,\u201d said Doug Scott, marketing manager for Ford\u2019s F-series business. \u201cThey want to be part of an exclusive club and have the most unique [truck] out there,\u201d he said. Related Ford Projects Up to 20% Mileage Gain in F-150 \nThe average sales price of a F-series hit a record $44,000 in June, $3,600 higher than a year ago, and nearly half of the vehicle\u2019s buyers opt for a higher-end version of the truck. \nSome of Ford\u2019s truck pricing power can be attributed to a recent F-150 redesign that included a move to a lighter-weight aluminum body. When new models are introduced, average sales prices typically increase. The higher prices are particularly welcome because of the higher cost of building the trucks with aluminum. \nOverall, Detroit auto makers are benefiting as customers respond to low gas prices and a growing economy by buying larger and more expensive vehicles. GM and Fiat Chrysler are getting more of their profit from pricey pickups and sport-utility vehicles. In part, demand for their bread-and butter sedans has weakened amid lower gasoline prices and emerging market sales are slumping. ENLARGE \nPickup truck sales grew at about twice the rate of the overall industry in the first half of this year, rising 10% through June, according to Autodata Corp. They now account for about 14% of all U.S. light-vehicle sales. \nOverall, U.S. auto sales are projected to top 17 million in 2015, one of the best years in the industry\u2019s history. The growth is accompanied by record high transaction prices and relatively modest discounts, indicating car companies are in a much healthier position than they were when sales reached similar levels early last decade. \n\u2018 Customers keep telling us \u2018we want more\u2026\u2019 \u2019 \u2014 Bob Hegbloom , Ram brand chief \nA fully-equipped Ram heavy-duty can run north of $70,000. The rush to add more luxury features to trucks won\u2019t stop, said Bob Hegbloom, who runs Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram division, because customers \u201ckeep telling us \u2018we want more in our trucks.\u2019 \u201d This summer, Ram rolled out a new version of its highest priced truck, the Laramie Limited, loading it up with richer features and adding $1,000 to the price tag. That model starts at about $51,000. \nMonte Clair, a general sales manager at Mac Haik Ford in Houston, said some buyers are trading in German luxury cars for well-appointed pickup trucks. \u201cThey\u2019re getting the amenities they want in a luxury vehicle but they can stay with a truck,\u201d Mr. Clair said. He recently had one customer trade in a 2012 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG for 2015 F-150 Platinum, which had been Ford\u2019s most expensive truck at $52,000. \nJohn Krafcik, a longtime auto executive now running online car buying firm TrueCar Inc., TRUE -14.99 % said Ford\u2019s move isn\u2019t just a clever marketing tactic. \u201cThese are successful blue-collar entrepreneurs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of social status and manufacturers have found a way to tap into it.\u201d ENLARGE The share of $50,000-and-up pickup trucks, like the Ford F150 Limited, sold in the U.S. has more than doubled in the last five years from 9% in 2010 to 22% this year. Photo: Ford Motor Co. \nTrueCar estimates more F-series sell at over $50,000 than any other vehicle on the market, a crown it stole from Daimler AG DDAIY -1.12 % \u2019s Mercedes-Benz E-Class in 2011. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s Ram is now No. 2 on that list. \nDespite the high prices, Ford\u2019s truck sales have slid this year because dealers haven\u2019t been able to get enough of the new models with one of Ford\u2019s two truck plants down earlier in the year for retooling. \nOn the less expensive XLT version of its F-150, the auto maker recently began advertising discounts of up to $7,050 on the 2015 model. Regionally, some dealers have been offering another $3,000 off on the new truck, prompting some analysts and dealers to question whether demand for the new truck might be softer than the company anticipates. \nFord officials say its promotions are typical of the truck business and are tied to dealers getting healthier supplies of the 2015 model year F-150. \nThrough the first half of the year, Ford\u2019s spending on truck incentives fell about $700 a vehicle, according to Autodata Corp., while it was down $9 for GM and up $95 for Fiat Chrysler. \nWrite to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com 198\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc was 591.3463745117188 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc was ",
