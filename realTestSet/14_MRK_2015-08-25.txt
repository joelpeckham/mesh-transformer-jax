By Daren Fonda See my bio, plus links to all my recent stories. , August 25, 2015 \nDividends are the lifeblood of Big Pharma stocks. The payouts ensure a steady income stream even when a company\u2019s shares stagnate. But a healthy dividend isn\u2019t the only reason to consider the shares of Merck & Co. (symbol MRK ). Not only does the drug maker\u2019s stock deliver a 3.3% yield, it also has potential for gains.

Top sellers include Januvia, a blockbuster diabetes drug, as well as drugs to treat cancer, high cholesterol and other ailments. Vaccines and animal health products round out Merck\u2019s lineup. \nSales have dipped from a peak of $48 billion in 2011, partly because Merck sold its consumer-products business in 2014. Analysts expect profits per share to inch up by just 3.5% over the next 12 months (compared with earnings in the 12-month period that ended June 30). The stock has lagged far behind such rivals as Pfizer ( PFE ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY ), trailing each by more than 20 percentage points over the past year.

The Kenilworth, N.J., company recently spent $8.4 billion to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a leading maker of antibiotics, including drugs to treat \u201csuperbugs\u201d that can cause pandemics. Merck says Cubist will add more than $1 billion to revenue in 2015 and bolster earnings per share in 2016. But more compelling from a profit perspective is Merck\u2019s pipeline of new products, including several with potential for more than $1 billion in annual sales. Merck's Next Blockbusters? \nLeading the way is Merck\u2019s cancer drug Keytruda, part of a new class of \u201cimmuno-oncology\u201d medicines that harness the body\u2019s defenses to shrink tumors. Already approved to treat melanoma, a form of skin cancer, Keytruda has shown effectiveness in treating some types of advanced lung cancer\u2014a potentially much larger market. The Food and Drug Administration is slated to rule on Merck\u2019s application for Keytruda to treat non-small-cell lung cancer in early October. Assuming Merck gets the green light and receives FDA approvals for other uses\u2014two big ifs\u2014Keytruda sales could reach $9 billion by 2023, estimates Bank of Montreal Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei. \nOther potential hits include a new drug for hepatitis C; a weekly diabetes drug (potentially expanding Merck\u2019s share of the diabetes-treatment market); and an anesthesia drug that has already been approved in Australia, Europe and Japan, and is under review by the FDA. All told, Merck is \u201con the verge of five to six years of strong growth,\u201d says Arfaei, who recently upgraded the stock from a rating of \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201coutperform\u201d and raised his 12-month price target to $70 per share, 30% above Merck\u2019s closing price on August 24 of $53.99. \nMerck still faces tough competition. Keytruda and other drugs vie for sales against rivals, and pressure from insurance companies could force Merck to lower prices, reducing profitability. Moreover, although future products look exciting, some may never reach the market. And there\u2019s always the chance that doctors will favor treatments made by other companies. \nYet investors aren\u2019t paying a steep price for Merck\u2019s future profit potential. The shares trade at 15 times estimated earnings of $3.60 per share over the next 12 months. That\u2019s roughly in line with the price-earnings ratios of Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ ). But investors may be underestimating the value of Merck\u2019s pipeline of new products, says Morningstar analyst Damien Connover. Even if the stock doesn\u2019t bounce over the near term, investors can collect that healthy dividend yield as they wait for all those drugs to reach pharmacy shelves.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Merck & Company, Inc. was 42.029788970947266 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Merck & Company, Inc. was ",
