Pace, which provides set-top box technology and software to the pay TV and broadband service industries, said it now expected the merger to close in late December 2015 or the first quarter of 2016 rather than the final quarter of this year. \nChairman Allan Leighton said: \"Whilst the potential delay to the date of completion is disappointing, the board of Pace believes that the strategic and economic rationale remains strong and reiterates its unanimous support for the combination. \n\"We continue to believe that the combination of the complementary Arris and Pace businesses will create a platform for future growth above and beyond our standalone potential.\" Tax cuts, pensions, childcare, online accounts and beer duty, here's \u2026 Related Stock Articles Follow the quotes you care about most.
