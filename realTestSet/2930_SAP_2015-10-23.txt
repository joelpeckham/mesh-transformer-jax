The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFriday, October 23, 2015 2:19PM IST (8:49AM GMT) (BW)(NV-RIMINI-STREET) Customers and Free Market Choice Are Winners in Oracle vs. Rimini Street Verdict Oracle confirmed in trial testimony that third-party support is lawful for Oracle licensees to purchaseTrial clarified permitted conduct and processes for vendors providing third-party supportNo disruption of service for Rimini Street clients Las Vegas, United States Rimini Street, Inc. , the leading independent provider of enterprise software support services for SAP SE\u2019s (NYSE:SAP) Business Suite and BusinessObjects software and Oracle Corporation\u2019s (NYSE:ORCL) Siebel , PeopleSoft , JD Edwards , E-Business Suite , Oracle Database , Oracle Middleware , Hyperion , Oracle Retail and Oracle Agile PLM software, declared enterprise software customers and free market choice the biggest winners in the recent Oracle vs. Rimini Street civil trial. The Company also provided additional details regarding the October 13, 2015 verdict and other post-trial activities. The jury verdict included the following findings: Jury rejected Oracle\u2019s damages claim of $246 million, instead awarded $50 million Jury found Rimini Street infringed, but found the infringement \u201cinnocent\u201d Jury rejected Oracle\u2019s claim that infringement was \u201cwillful\u201d Jury found that Oracle suffered no lost profits as a result of \u201cinnocent\u201d infringement Jury found violations of some computer access laws Jury rejected Oracle\u2019s claims for illegal tortious business conduct, such as inducing breach of contract and interference with Oracle\u2019s business relationships Jury rejected Oracle\u2019s claims for punitive damages Legality of Third-Party Support Confirmed Detailed testimony and evidence provided by Oracle executives and witnesses in the trial confirmed that third-party support is lawful for Oracle licensees to purchase. The evidence presented at trial supported several important principles underlying Rimini Street\u2019s operations and current service offerings: (a) Oracle licensees can choose not to renew their Oracle annual support; (b) Oracle licensees can select, switch to, and use a third-party support provider or self-support instead of renewing and paying Oracle for annual support services; (c) third parties like Rimini Street can legally offer third-party support options to Oracle licensees; and (d) support services can be provided to clients utilizing a remote access connection. These rights enable legal, free market choice for customers who want to shop a variety of different support vendors, services offerings, and pricing models. Jury Found \u201cInnocent\u201d Infringement The jury found that Rimini Street \u201cinnocently\u201d infringed certain Oracle copyrights. The verdict reflected the jury\u2019s assessment of the fair market value of a license for the actual use of Oracle\u2019s copyrighted works. In determining \u201cinnocent infringement,\u201d the court instructed the jury that: \u201cAn infringement is considered \u2018innocent\u2019 when the Defendant has proved both of the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence: The Defendant was not aware that its acts constituted infringement of the copyright; and The Defendant had no reason to believe that its acts constituted an infringement of the copyright.\u201d A significant portion of conduct at issue in the case stemmed from Rimini Street previously offering its Oracle PeopleSoft, JD Edwards and Siebel customers the choice of providing Rimini Street with either remote access to development and test environments on client-hosted servers, or providing Rimini Street with copies of their Oracle software to build development and test environments on Rimini Street-hosted servers. The court had previously held that, based on a court ruling issued in 2014, Oracle PeopleSoft software license agreements generally do not permit Oracle software to be installed or copied on Rimini Street servers. In accordance with the ruling, Rimini Street ceased the use of Oracle software on its servers and transitioned to a remote access connection service model for all clients by July 2014. Post-Trial Activities With the jury verdict rendered, the parties will now engage in standard post-trial activities. Either party may file motions related to the jury\u2019s findings. After the completion of the post-trial activities, either party may file an appeal from the court\u2019s final judgment. Injunction An \u201cinjunction\u201d is a court order that would prohibit or mandate certain activities or conduct that was found infringing or unlawful. Given the jury\u2019s findings and the fact that Rimini Street ceased using the particular processes that Oracle challenged as infringing, Rimini Street does not believe that any injunction relating to any current Rimini Street support process is necessary or warranted. Other Related Litigation In 2014, Rimini Street filed a lawsuit against Oracle seeking a judicial finding that Rimini Street\u2019s new development process and tools for PeopleSoft tax, legal, and regulatory updates, implemented by July 2014, do not infringe any Oracle copyrights. Oracle countersued, claiming alleged infringement of PeopleSoft copyrights. This litigation is in the discovery phase, and no trial date has been scheduled.
