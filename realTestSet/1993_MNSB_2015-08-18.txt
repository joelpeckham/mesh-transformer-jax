Although the five-member board specifically declined to rule on the substantive question of whether college football players are employees, the ruling makes them ineligible for collective bargaining protection under the National Labor Relations Act. This decision overturns a previous ruling in favor of the students by the Chicago regional office of the NLRB. \nIt\u2019s a significant setback for what has become an increasingly tense question in college sports. Players at many elite football schools have begun to challenge the traditional concept of the student-athlete, citing issues such as 14-hour days, informal compensation in the form of player scholarships and the billion-dollar NCAA industry as evidence that a college football player is closer to a paid employee than a typical undergrad.
