INNRSTYL.com, the newly launched fashion platform that uses high-tech fabrication and innovative design to streamline work clothes for wearability. Hong Kong Who ever said style-savvy corporate workers wouldn\u2019t want to wear sweatpants to work? Better yet, who ever thought they could? Enter, INNRSTYL. They\u2019re the fashion-forward company rolling out everything from dress pants to shoes made of comfortable, high-performance fabrics. Partnering with companies with innovative design on their minds, the game-changing company makes sitting at a desk feel like a day on the couch. Mining trends, INNRSTYL brings a chic, career-centric approach to what Huffington Post called \u201cAthleisure\u201d. The term was recently used by the iconic news source to describe wearing comfortable fabrics for everything but working out. With the softness of yoga gear, and the fit of high-fashion dress pants, INNRSTYL\u2019s flagship products are a timely cut above. INNRSTYL now launches their Comfort Dress Pants for men named Stealth and the women\u2019s version aptly called Svelte . Cesario Tam, Co-Founder and Managing Director at INNRSTYL said of the launch, \u201cThe consumers\u2019 comfort shouldn\u2019t be an afterthought when it comes to clothing design. INNRSTYL strives to be the hub for clothes with a comfortable, user-centered design for work and life.\u201d To that end, INNRSTYL has partnered with like-minded companies. Joining their ranks is The UT Lab . The UT Lab uses new-age materials like Dupont\u2019s Tyvek and Kevlar - yes, the stuff they use to make bullet-proof vests - to make shoes. Their TYVEK Light Wing Trainer is water-resistant, breathable, and feels like paper weighing in at 150 grams per shoe. Other innovative partners include Ministry of Supply and Kore Essentials. Ministry of Supply is a high tech company that brought space suit technology into their flagship dress shirt APOLLO that can regulate body temperature and Kore Essentials literally removed all belt holes to create high-grade leather belt system that ensures a perfect fit every time.
