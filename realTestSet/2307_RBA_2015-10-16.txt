The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFri, Oct 16, 2015, 7:08 PM AEDT - Australia Markets closed $A loses ground on RBA comments AAP \u2013 1 hour 56 minutes ago Recommend Print \nThe Australian dollar has sagged after investors interpreted the Reserve Bank's appraisal of property markets as evidence a rate cut is back on the cards. \nAt 1700 AEDT on Friday, the currency was trading at 72.90 US cents, down from 73.19 cents on Thursday. \nEasy Forex currency dealer Andreas Tjahja said the fall came on the back of better than expected US inflation data overnight, and the release of the RBA's Financial Stability Review. \nIn its report, the central bank said risks in the housing market remain high and the safety net for borrowers is smaller, but tighter lending standards are helping. \nThat has been seen as potentially adding to the case for a cash rate cut before the end of the year, Mr Tjahja said. \n\"The market had disregarded this (idea) after the last RBA meeting,\" he said. \n\"Sentiment in the last few days has prompted a wave of more and more investment banks offering reasons why the RBA will cut.\" \nAt 1700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was at 86.86 Japanese yen, down from Thursday's close of 87.05 yen, and at 64.05 euro cents, up from 63.74 euro cents. \nThe Australian bond market has ended the week lower, tracking US trends after inflation was higher than expectations. \nOvernight, US treasuries were also a little lower on the back of stock market strength, National Australia Bank head of research Peter Jolly said. \nFalling petrol prices pushed US consumer prices lower for a second straight month in September, but core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent. \n\"It perhaps keeps the (US Federal Reserve) rate hike on track,\" he said. \nLocally, Westpac's decision this week to slug borrowers with a mortgage rate increase was also fuelling speculation about a cut to the cash rate. \n\"The front end of the yield curve has rallied a bit over the last few days as people have moved to increase the chances the RBA would need to cut,\" Mr Jolly said. \n\"Right now the market pricing for a November rate cut is around 35 per cent, and we already have close to two rate cuts priced by the middle of next year.\" \nDespite the aggressive moves, NAB believes the RBA would wait to see how other banks and the economy respond before making any knee-jerk reactions on monetary policy, he said. \nAt 1630 AEDT on Friday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.375 (implying a yield of 2.625 per cent), down from 97.405 (2.595 per cent) on Thursday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.210 (1.790 per cent), down from 98.230 (1.780 per cent). @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Santos boosted by first GLNG shipment AAP \nSantos shares have jumped after the oil and gas producer made its first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ritchie Bros.
