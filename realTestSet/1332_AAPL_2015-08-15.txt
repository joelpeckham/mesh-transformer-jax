The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSaturday, August 15, 2015 10:45AM IST (5:15AM GMT) IBC International Honour for Excellence Recognises ARM London, United Kingdom The International Honour for Excellence 2015, the highest honour IBC bestows, this year recognises a technology \u2013 and the company behind it \u2013 which has been a key enabler of the transformation of our industry. The award goes to ARM, the company behind the processors in virtually all of our smartphones and tablets. It is sobering to realise that the iPhone is barely more than eight years old, yet it and the products that followed have transformed the way we view media. That we can drive realtime, high resolution graphics and videos on a device in the palm of our hand, with a day\u2019s battery life is a remarkable technical achievement. It is made possible by ARM\u2019s specialisation, reduced instruction set computing (RISC). Today, around one-third of all intelligent electronic devices have ARM technology inside, thanks to its development and continuing research. In turn, the creative, commercial and technical future of the media industry depends upon these mobile devices.\u201d Simon Segars, CEO of ARM, said \u201cWe see an exciting future for the broadcast and entertainment industry as evolving technology brings new revenue streams, diversity in consumption and seamless viewing experiences across all devices.\u201d \u201cBut getting there will require effort, as technology must be delivered in the most cost, capacity and energy efficient way so companies remain as sustainable as they are innovative,\u201d he added. \u201cARM designs intelligence that enables industry to create the content, refine it in production and get it on to everyone\u2019s screens, and we will fully support the sector in this next phase.\u201d \u201cIt is for this reason that we are hugely excited to be formally welcomed into the IBC family with the 2015 International Honour for Excellence.\u201d The world\u2019s first commercially successful RISC processor was launched 30 years ago by Acorn Computer Group. In 1990 the work on which Acorn and Apple were collaborating was spun out into a new company, Advanced RISC Machines or ARM. By 2002 a billion ARM RISC cores were made; by 2013 that had grown to a staggering 50bn. The International Honour for Excellence is awarded by the IBC Council. IBC Council Chair Peter Owen said \u201cMobile devices have proved a disruptive, transformative technology for the electronic media industry. Smartphones and tablets owe their existence to RISC processors.\u201d \u201cFor pioneering, enabling and innovating the most advanced RISC technology, IBC is pleased to present its 2015 International Honour for Excellence to ARM.\u201d The award will be presented during the IBC Awards Ceremony, which takes place in the RAI Auditorium on Sunday 13 September at 18:30. All IBC attendees are invited to come along to this free event.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 26.580068588256836 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
