MUMBAI: At ICICI Bank, the amount of loans that were falling behind in payments but still classified as standard loans, nearly doubled last fiscal year, increasing the risk of higher bad loans in the future, said Ambit Capital , a securities firm. Concentration risk for the bank is also rising with 32.8 per cent of its capital funds exposure to a single corporate group with same management, up from 29.1 per cent a year earlier, it said citing regulatory filing. \"The delinquency breakup of the standard loan book suggests that early delinquencies (31-90 day due) have almost doubled from 3.6 per cent of loans as at FY14 to 6.4 per cent of loans as at FY15,\" Ambit said citing ICICI Bank's filing with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) of the US. \"In absolute terms, the exposure to the biggest corporate group increased 18 per cent YoY in FY15. The name of this corporate group is not known, but if it is one of those highly levered and stressed corporates, this does not bode well for the bank.\" Among the private sector banks, investors and analysts have been raising concerns about the quality of bad loans at ICICI Bank as it has lent money to infrastructure groups unlike its peer, HDFC Bank. The bank for the June quarter said profit rose 12 per cent and the bank's gross bad loans rose to .`15,138 crore, or 3.68 per cent of its total loans. Its shares ended flat at Rs 311.3 on the BSE on Thursday. \"We experienced a significant increase in the downgrade of standard restructured loans to the non-performing category comprises 45 per cent of the total loan book. The bank had filed its annual report on July 24. ICICI Bank did not respond to the email sent by ET. Although the amount of loans that were behind payments by 30 days jumped, it may not be a cause of worry since they need not be classified as bad loans. A loan is classified as NPA (nonperforming asset) when the borrower fails to repay the loan within 90 days of the due date while the bank has to set aside 15 per cent of the loan amount as provisions. However, when a borrower fails to repay loan on due date it is an early sign of stress in the company. Taking cognisance of these early signs of stress, the Reserve Bank of India has asked banks to form a joint lenders forum as soon as a loan is overdue for over 60 days.  \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HDFC Bank Limited was 30.428491592407227 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HDFC Bank Limited was ",
