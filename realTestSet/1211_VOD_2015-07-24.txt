By Alessandro Pasetti | Fool.co.uk \u2013 16 minutes ago 240.318 +8.3680 \nIn its trading update for the quarter ended 30 June 2015, Vodafone (LSE: VOD) revealed today a stronger growth rate, which came in above expectations. \nThings are getting better, yet there are still a few problems. \nThe same applies to Pearson (LSE: PSON), whose half-year numbers have just hit the wire: it isn't doing particularly well, but news about the \u00a3844m disposal of The Financial Times to Japan's Nikkei and a higher payout was welcomed by investors. \nNeither stock is on my wish list, however. Here's why. Is Vodafone Building Trust? \nThe shares of Vodafone roared back today in the wake of a first-quarter trading update that certainly pleased its shareholders. Its stock was up 3.7% in early trade, and could certainly gain strength when the US markets open, at least if recent quarterly trends can be trusted. \nEverybody wants to know if Vodafone has turned the corner -- it hasn't, in my opinion, and I need more evidence to commit to it. \nAdmittedly, at +0.8%, its first-quarter organic service revenue growth was 0.2/0.3 percentage points above consensus estimates, and 0.7 percentage points higher than in the fourth quarter. \nTrends are good, but its growth rate is still very close to zero. \nIt's been a long way so far in its restructuring, and while European growth remains problematic (UK flat; Italy down 2%; Spain down 5.5%), Vodafone isn't faring too bad in emerging markets -- but it will need a steeper growth rate at group level to catch my attention. Germany & Valuation \nIts German operations are very important given their scale and the amount of investment that has been poured in the business over time: they reported a -1.2% growth rate against -2% in the previous quarter once the figures for cable operator Kabel Deutschland are included, which means that its acquisition-led strategy is paying some dividends. \nDoes all this make Vodafone a buy, though? \nWell, based on fundamentals, its stock is still overvalued by at least 10% at 237p a share, where it currently trades, in my opinion. \nI'd give it a pass. Pearson's Restructuring Continues \nThe shares of Pearson are nicely rising at the time of writing (+2.6%), but there are a few things you should consider in spite of enthusiasm surrounding its latest divestment, which fetched a much higher valuation than the one that the market had expected. \nIts stock trades about 13% below the multi-year high of 1,517p that Pearson recorded in mid-March this year -- but does that signal a buying opportunity? \nIts forward trading multiples based on net earnings stand above 20x, which does not signal bargain territory, particularly because the media and education sector is at a critical juncture. \nIn a move away from media, it sold Mergermarket to BC Partners for \u00a3382m in November 2013. Now the FT 's gone. \nPearson is focusing more on education than on media, which is a strategy that makes a lot of sense, but the key question is whether it'll manage to preserve its core profitability metrics. \nThe group reiterated its guidance for the year today, and the dividend rose 6% to 18p, but operating losses are widening, adjusted earnings per shares of 4.4p (2014: 4.7p) fell, primarily reflecting the sale of Mergermarket, while operating cash flow and free cash flow were down to -\u00a3333m and -\u00a3424m, respectively, from -\u00a3254m and -\u00a3328m one year earlier. \nHealthy cash flow and free cash flow are very important metrics when it comes to selecting the right equity investment, and this why I'd rather invest in one of these five shares than in Vodafone and Pearson present. \nConsider that sustainable cash flow and rising growth rates supported the surge in the valuation of a British consumer giant that is included in our report, and whose trading update surprised investors this week. \nClick here to learn more, but do it now -- our report is completely free and comes without further obligations only for a limited amount of time! \nAlessandro Pasetti has no position in any shares mentioned.
