But with the price of oil and metals like gold and silver at their lowest levels in years, fewer clients are awarding contracts for engineering, management, and other services.

The stock has fallen 36 percent over the past year. \nAnalysts remained optimistic about Fluor's prospects in spite of the results, however.

Jefferies & Co. analyst Luke Folta said the company expects to book some major contracts later this year and in 2016. \nBoth analysts rate the shares at \"Buy\" or the equivalent. Afzal cut her price target to $68 from $74 and Folta lowered his to $67 from $75. \nAccording to FactSet, 15 analysts report \"Buy\" ratings on Fluor shares and seven have \"Hold\" ratings.
