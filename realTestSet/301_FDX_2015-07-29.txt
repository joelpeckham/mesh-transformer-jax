[.N] \nNot faring so well was Twitter, which sank 11 percent in extended trade after the microblogging company said its monthly average users grew at the slowest pace since it went public in 2013. \nThe Fed ends a two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday with markets divided on whether it will take a hawkish or dovish stance, while some suspect it might chose to do neither. No move on rates is expected this week. \nIn recent congressional testimony, Fed Chair Janet Yellen neither ruled out a September hike nor guided the market toward thinking it was a done deal. \n\"We think the upcoming FOMC statement will reflect this non-committal approach,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets. \n\"In other words, there will be no explicit tweak to the guidance signalling a hike is imminent.\" \nAt most, the Fed might sound a little more positive on the economy and describe risks to the outlook as balanced rather than \"nearly\" balanced, Porcelli added. \nIn currency markets, investors seemed to decide it was safer not to be short of the U.S. dollar ahead of the policy statement at 1800 GMT. \nThe dollar was holding at 123.45 yen, from a low of 123.04 on Tuesday, while the euro stood at $1.1082. \nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar was off 0.2 percent at 96.505. \nIn energy markets, oil prices were subdued ahead of official data on U.S. stockpiles. [O/R] \nBrent futures were down 8 cents at $53.21 a barrel and near their lowest since February. U.S. crude futures slipped 6 cents to $47.92 a barrel. \n(Editing by Kim Coghill and Jacqueline Wong)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was 157.49276733398438 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was ",
