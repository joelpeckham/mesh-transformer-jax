The contract was secured by Q3 Contracting (\u201cQ3C\u201d), part of the West Construction Services segment. The award is a five year agreement to perform site restoration services. The work includes both hard and soft surface restoration, including concrete, asphalt, and sod replacement. Q3C has been successfully performing this work for the client for over ten years. It is estimated that the MSA will generate approximately $9 million per year over the course of the contract. While the agreement does not obligate the customer to award Primoris a specific dollar amount, our discussions and history with the customer form the basis for our anticipated value. \nABOUT PRIMORIS \nFounded in 1960, Primoris, through various subsidiaries, has grown to become one of the largest publicly traded specialty construction and infrastructure companies in the United States.
