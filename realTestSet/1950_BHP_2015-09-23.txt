The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPrint \nBHP Billiton has defended the use of a Singapore marketing hub to minimise its tax payments, saying most of its Australian profits continue to be taxed in its home country. \nThe resources giant, which came under fire earlier this year over its use of the Singapore hub, says its global adjusted effective tax rate was 31.8 per cent, well above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average corporate income tax rate of 25 per cent. \nThe company paid $US7.3 billion ($A10.30 billion) in taxes, royalties and other payments to governments in the countries it operates in around the world during the 2014/15 financial year. \nOf this, nearly $US5.24 billion was paid in Australia. \n\"These are large amounts, and what would be regarded as fair,\" chief financial officer Peter Beaven said on a conference call. \nBHP and rival Rio Tinto, along with other multinationals including Apple and Google have been under investigation by the Australian Taxation Office since earlier this year over the use of Singapore marketing hubs to allegedly reduce their tax bills. \nThe company said it has fully disclosed and explained to the authorities its reasons for the Singapore operations. \n\"We are in Singapore because its the most appropriate place to undertake that part of the value chain. Additionally, it also has a very attractive tax rate,\" Mr Beaven said. The Singapore operatons were 64 per cent-owned by the Australian unit, and were, therefore, also subject to Australian taxes, he said. \nBHP pays tax at an average rate of 33.5 per cent in Australia, but pays zero tax on its marketing operations in Singapore. \nLast week, the federal government introduced draft laws to target tax avoidance by big international companies. However, the move comes just a month ahead of the findings from a broader action plan under the OECD/G20 base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. \nBHP supports reform on BEPS, but believes this should only come through a multilateral effort, Mr Beaven said. \n\"If there is clumsy, unilateral action, it could end up in a very chaotic and competitive situation. You could have a situation where we have to pay tax twice,\" he said. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook BHP says it's paying a fair share of taxes AAP \nBHP Billiton has defended the use of a Singapore marketing hub to minimise its tax payments, saying most of its \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was 25.428871154785156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was ",
