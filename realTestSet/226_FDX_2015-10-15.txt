Kumar told Bloomberg News. \n- Liquidity tap left on? - \nThe Fed has held its key rate locked near zero, at an unprecedented low of 0-0.25 percent, since December 2008 in order to stimulate economic growth. \nThe path of American interest rates is vital for global markets because the United States is the world's biggest economy. \n\"No rate hike keeps the liquidity tap on,\" noted VTB Capital economist Neil MacKinnon. \nIn midday deals, London's benchmark FTSE 100 index won 0.92 percent to 6,327.10 points compared with Wednesday's close. \nFrankfurt's DAX 30 climbed 1.42 percent to 10,0056 points and the Paris CAC 40 rose 1.24 percent to 4,666. \nIn foreign exchange, the European single currency slipped to $1.1446, from $1.1469 late in New York on Wednesday. \nMining share prices were spurred higher in London by a recovery in commodity prices, dealers said. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in troubled resources giant Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) won 2.79 percent to 123.35 pence, while fellow miner Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGY - news ) added 1.12 percent to 587 pence. \nThe biggest loser was Britain's luxury fashion group Burberry, whose share price collapsed after admitting that demand had been hit by China's slowdown. \nBurberry shares tumbled 10.85 percent to stand at 1,265 pence. \nSales flatlined at \u00a31.105 billion ($1.704 billion, 1.485 billion euros) in the six months to September compared with \u00a31.1 billion a year earlier, said Burberry, which is famous for its trench coats and signature accessories (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was 140.34637451171875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was ",
