PUBLISHED: 21:34, Mon, Jul 27, 2015 | UPDATED: 21:43, Mon, Jul 27, 2015 GETTY & PA Michael O\u2019Leary is taking aim at a new target \nThe budget carrier, which competes with the likes of Expedia and Opodo by offering hotels and car hire on its own website, has written to four leading airlines, thought to be British Airways owner IAG, easyJet, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, asking them to display each other\u2019s fares on their website in a bid to circumvent comparison sites. \nIt also expects a price war to intensify as rivals are forced to respond to its increased annual growth target of carrying 103 million passengers, up from previous guidance of 100 million. \nRyanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said: \u201cI think it is something the big airlines could and should work together on because I think it makes no sense for third-party price comparison websites out there. \n\u201cIf the airlines were competitive and had a competent digital offering those kind of websites shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d I think it is something the big airlines could and should work together on because I think it makes no sense for third-party price comparison websites out there Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary \nHe said he expects a response soon. \nRyanair\u2019s charm offensive under its Always Getting Better programme, including a softer stance on booking conditions and baggage charges, helped it attract 28 million customers in the first quarter, up from 24.3 million a year ago. \nPost-tax profit jumped 25 per cent to \u20ac245 million. \nIts average fare fell by 4 per cent to \u20ac45 and it expects fares to fall by between 4 and 8 per cent in the second half. \nO\u2019Leary said: \u201cWe expect our faster capacity growth and lower oil prices may lead to an aggressive pricing response from competitors who will try to defend their market shares. \n\"We continue to be inundated with growth offers from primary and secondary airports, whose incumbent carriers are cutting capacity and traffic. \n\"These new airports, along with our 72 existing bases, offer significant growth opportunities.\u201d \nRyanair said it is on course to make annual profit towards the top end of its guidance of \u20ac940-970million, 12 per cent above last year.
