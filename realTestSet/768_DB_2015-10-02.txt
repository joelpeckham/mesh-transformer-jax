The \"main business\" test measures speculative trading in commodity derivatives as a percentage of its total commodity derivatives trading. \n\"The regulation fails to reflect the legislation that ESMA are meant to be implementing, which says that wholesale buying and selling activity is fine if it's ancillary to your main business,\" Dawson said. \nESMA said the aim was to increase transparency, efficiency and safety for equity and equity-like products. \n\"In order to achieve this, the overarching principle of MiFID is to treat firms which act like financials equal to investment firms,\" a spokesman said. \n\"For energy firms, MiFID...provides some caveats and exemptions already which are captured in the so-called tests.\" \nOil majors Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) and BP have said the new regulations would tie up billions of dollars of capital related to trading, which otherwise could have gone toward investment into new oil and gas resources. \nRestrictions on banks and capital requirements has already subdued enthusiasm for commodity trading and liquidity has already been impaired. \nThe absence of wholesalers could compromise liquidity more severely and consequences would be a wider spread between buying and selling prices and higher costs for the real economy, Dawson said. \n\"Every 10 percent increase in the spread will cost the European economy 270 million euros on an annual basis. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is not unlikely that the spread could double - which would cost the economy 2.7 billion euros,\" the energy industry group estimates. \n\"The impact of reduced market liquidity on hedging costs could translate into 11.7 billion euros in additional costs on an annual basis to industry due to the longer time needed to hedge consumption or production of energy.\" \nFinancial products to hedge production and consumption could also be taken off the shelves, which Dawson estimates could cost the EU nearly one billion euros a year, at a time when economic growth is struggling to gain traction. \n(Reporting by Pratima Desai; additional reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Veronica Brown and Adrian Croft)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 25.50295066833496 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
