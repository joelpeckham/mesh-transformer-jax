The miner in April deferred a port project that would have boosted output to 290 million tonnes by mid-2017. \nBHP is facing ever-stiffer competition from Vale and Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) for its share of the seabourne iron ore trade, which many analysts believe will not meet bullish forecasts, contributing to a collapse prices. \nBHP said it saw a 41 percent decline in the price of its ore in fiscal 2015 to $61 per wet metric tonne. Iron ore is trading around $52 a tonne, down from prices above $190 in early 2011 on slowing demand growth in China. \nThe June quarter output for BHP's share of production of 60.1 million tonnes was in line with analysts' estimates of 60 million tonnes. The full-year production figures and guidance take into account the share of output for BHP's joint venture partners in some mines. \nRival Rio Tinto this month cut its calendar 2015 target for shipments by 10 million tonnes to 340 million tonnes after two cyclones disrupted operations. \nBHP said it expects the latest impairments to total between $350 million and $650 million, mostly tied to its Cerro Colorado mine in Chile and redundancies in the overall copper business. A reduction in the use of rigs will also contribute between $50 million and $150 million to the writedown.
