The California-based technology giant shares in revenue generated in any applications on its mobile devices. \nThe newest software powering Apple mobile devices allows apps that block ads from pages while surfing the internet using Safari web browser, but does not extend that capability into applications people use. \nWhile blocking ads promised to make surfing the internet from iPhones or iPads faster and rein in telecom data use, it also sabotages what has long been the main way websites make money while providing free content or services. \nAFP\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 25.099321365356445 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
