Some 75% of experts polled by Bankrate.com said they expect Millennials to ditch cash, roll the dice and invest in stocks. While some may question their timing, since the S&P 500 is up about 210% since its March 2009 low, strategists say there is still some steam left in the bull market. \"Corporate profits will continue to be the major driver of stock prices over the next 12 months,\" Chuck Carlson, CEO of Horizon Investment Services told Bankrate in its survey. The median forecast among the experts polled in the survey on where the S&P 500 will stand over the next year stands at 2,209. That's about a 5% return from the broad index's current level of 2,107. With interest rates at record lows, rates on savings accounts and certificates of deposits have also dipped. The average interest rate for a 1-year CD stands at 0.37%, according to RateWatch, a subsidiary of TheStreet . \"Frustrated with the prospect of very low returns on cash, the tendency to garner better returns with equities will force many to shift out of cash-weighted investments,\" Mark Hamrick, Bankrate's Washington bureau chief, told TheStreet . The report comes as Millennials continue to fear Wall Street, with just 14% of Millennials saying they trust Wall Street to \"do the right thing all or most of the time,\" according to a recent study. But that distrust may be thinning. \"With the passage of time, memories of the severe market decline during the financial crisis [in 2008] are fading,\" Hamrick added. He also said technology is another force that could push Millennials into stocks. 1\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was 6.5 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was ",
