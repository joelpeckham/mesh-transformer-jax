(NYSE: AAP) beat analysts' estimates, finishing out the second quarter with nearly $150 million in profit, or about $2.27 per share, compared to an average analyst estimate of $2.25 per share, according to reports to Yahoo Finance. Advance Auto also announced on Thursday through its second-quarter earnings report that it will be closing 50 stores before the end of the year in markets across the U.S. A list of the locations that would be closing, however, was not available. The company, as of July 18, operated 5,369 stores across the country and Canada, of which about 1,060 still operate under the Carquest brand name that Advance Auto had inherited from its $2 billion acquisition of Raleigh-based General Parts International in January 2014 . Spokeswoman Laurie Stacy says all of the company-owned Carquest auto parts retail stores will be rebranded to Advance over the next couple of years. The change-over will not impact the 1,300 independently-owned Carquest stores that were not included in the General Parts deal. \"We are approaching rebranding on a market-by-market basis until all stores are complete,\" she says. But even with the store brand changeover, Stacy reiterates that the Carquest brand will not be going away. \"We recently rebranded our company\u2019s commercial program as Advance Professional Driven by Carquest and provide an exclusive offering of Carquest brand products that deliver premium quality and proven reliability in products designed and rigorously tested for the professional technician,\" Stacy stated in an email. Since the General Parts acquisition, 170 Carquest-branded stores have either been converted to the Advance Auto brand or a store's staff consolidated with a nearby Advance Auto Parts store. Only one Carquest store has been closed since the acquisition outside of those that were shuttered through consolidation, according to Advance Auto's files. In the same time period, the company has opened about 160 new Advance Auto Parts store locations, not counting the conversions from Carquest . It also owns 334 stores or branches under the Auto International, BWP or Worldpac brand names. Advance also reported an increase in sales during the 12 weeks ended July 18. Compared to the same period in 2014, Advance's second-quarter sales in 2015 increased 1 percent to $2.37 billion. \nWant Raleigh/Durham Retailing & Restaurants news in your inbox?
