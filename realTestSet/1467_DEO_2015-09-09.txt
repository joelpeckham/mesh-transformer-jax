The tender price represents a 40 percent premium to its closing price of 124 naira on Tuesday, Guinness said in a statement. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Lagos-listed Guinness Nigeria, which has lost 25.5 percent so far this year, gained 5 percent to 131.48 naira each after the news, outperforming the broader stock index down 2.85 percent after JP Morgan's bond index expulsion moves. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) said the local brewer would continue to be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange after the deal which is still subject to regulatory approvals. \nMultinationals from Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever (Amsterdam: UZ8.AS - news ) to British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) have bought more stakes in their Nigeria units, shrugging off the prospects of a weaker domestic economy and worries over a six-year old insurgency largely in the Muslim north. \nDiageo's intentions comes as pretax profits in Nigeria are falling, amidst rising competition particularly from rival brewer Heineken (Other OTC: HEINY - news ) and a consumer segment squeeze in the wake of dwindling government revenues after crude prices plunged. \nIndustry sources said Diageo was taking a bet on Nigeria's future given its relatively young population of 170 million people and the possible shift to a consumer-driven market from its economy's current reliance on the oil sector . \nLast week Guinness reported an 8 percent fall in pretax profit to 10.8 billion naira for 2015 and proposed a dividend. \n($1 = 199.00 naira) (Additional reporting by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Jermey Gaunt)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Diageo plc was 91.37357330322266 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Diageo plc was ",
