ADDING MULTIMEDIA IIX, Shujog, and KKR Partner with Glovax to Scale Social Impact Press Release : KKR \u2013 27 minutes ago Recommend 23.76 -0.39 \nMANILA, Philippines & SINGAPORE--(BUSINESSWIRE)-- Impact Investment Exchange Asia (\u201cIIX\u201d), a leader in social development through impact investment, Shujog, IIX\u2019s not-for-profit sister organization, and KKR, a leading global investment firm, successfully completed their second social enterprise technical assistance project with Glovax Biotech. Glovax is a fully integrated vaccine company in the Philippines that imports, distributes, and retails vaccines at affordable rates to low-to-middle-income Filipinos. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150720006495/en/ \n\u201cI know first-hand good health is the foundation upon which people advance in society,\u201d said Glovax founder and CEO, Giovanni Alingog. \u201cI wanted to create a business in the Philippines that gives families access to vaccines when they would not otherwise receive them so that they may have healthier lives.\u201d \nLaunched in 2003, Glovax offers a critical service in the Philippines by importing low-cost vaccines directly from manufacturers. In addition to providing logistics services to a wide-range of customers, it distributes vaccines through its branded centers to hospitals, clinics, and doctors. In its first decade, Glovax provided more than 4 million doses of vaccinations to Filipinos who might not otherwise have had access to vaccines. \nIt also manages a Low-Income Relief Unit to offer free vaccinations to the Philippines\u2019 poorest demographic. Managed in partnership with socio-civic organizations, Glovax effectively responds to local communities\u2019 needs, having provided more than 130,000 doses of free vaccinations. \nIIX, Shujog and KKR partnered to provide necessary financial, operational, and analytical expertise to better position Glovax for funding. Members of IIX, KKR, and KKR Capstone \u2013 an independent team of operational experts \u2013 conducted site visits and assessed Glovax\u2019s business model and social impact. The team helped Glovax develop a business plan, financial model and impact assessment. \nFollowing the technical assistance project, Glovax obtained a US$1 million credit line from BDO Universal Bank. With this funding, Glovax will increase the number of doses it markets annually to low-to-middle income people from 400,000 to 500,000. Also, 10 additional staff will be hired to increase its market penetration. \n\u201cThe lessons learned from KKR and IIX gave me the confidence to be more aggressive in raising funds,\u201d said Alingog. \u201cKKR and IIX showed me that raising equity now would be expensive and dilutive. Instead, we explored cheaper forms of capital. As a result, Glovax secured bank credit and is better positioned to thoughtfully grow and help more Filipino patients receive life-saving vaccines. Without this project, we may still be struggling to raise equity. Now, we are investing and growing.\u201d \n\u201cOur Social Impact Assessment shows that by helping people avoid disease, Glovax protects its customers and their families from suffering while enabling a chance to continue their education, better hold steady employment, and elevate out of poverty,\u201d said Robert Kraybill, Managing Director of IIX. \u201cGlovax is exactly the type of social enterprise which IIX was created to assist.\u201d \n\u201cLeveraging KKR and KKR Capstone\u2019s financial and operational skills gives Glovax the opportunity to increase its financial return and scale its social impact,\u201d said Steven R. Okun, Director of Public Affairs at KKR Asia Pacific. \u201cThis is what KKR\u2019s Technical Assistance program is all about \u2013 finding ways to help social enterprises get the capital that is available to them to increase their financial and social return.\u201d \nGlovax aims to next scale its business and its social impact with a target of providing approximately 3.5 million additional doses of vaccines to low-to-lower-middle-income Filipinos by 2018 by building out its network of doctors, increasing the number of vaccines it imports and distributes, and expanding its branded VaxCen clinics. \nA video case study on Glovax and the IIX and KKR technical assistance project can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeizzBttoYo&feature=youtu.be \nAbout Glovax \nGlovax opened its first vaccination clinic in 2003 and has now grown its business to three clinics and 10 retail distribution centers across Manila.
