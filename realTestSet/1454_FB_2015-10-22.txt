Posted on the site are grip-and-grin photos of Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung meeting with foreign dignitaries and press releases about government policies and activities. The site, run out of the the prime minister\u2019s office, was set up earlier this month. \nUnlike China\u2019s Communist officials, who still ban Facebook, Vietnam has joined the social media fray it once opposed. The government, while maintaining some control over information, is signaling it\u2019s willing to risk facing the wrath of citizens and overseas Vietnamese critical of its policies and one-party system as it gears for a political transition with a new slate of leaders next year. \n\u201cThe Vietnamese leadership is becoming more practical,\u201d said Vu Tu Thanh, chief Vietnam representative of the U.S.-Asean Business Council. \u201cA new and younger generation of officials have been elected to various provincial positions who are familiar with modern tools like Facebook.\u201d \nThe government, after lobbying by the U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and the Asean Business Council, of which Facebook is a member, stopped blocking the social network two years ago, he said. Nearly half of Vietnam\u2019s 90 million population is online, according to the government. There are 30 million active Facebook users who access the social media site monthly, according to Tuoi Tre newspaper. \nThe government\u2019s Facebook page is a pilot project, said Vi Quang Dao, who oversees the page as well as the government\u2019s main website. \u201cWe aim to expand channels to increase giving information to the public on government activities,\u201d he said. \nCommunist leaders are preparing for next year\u2019s Party Congress, which will usher in a political transition across the government. Vietnam\u2019s leaders have learned that taking small steps toward transparency, and admitting mistakes, gives the government more credibility, Thanh said. \nThe government is sure to have a system in place to ensure comments it considers too critical of the leadership will be omitted, he said. Already, critical comments have begun to appear. \n\u201cThis government information page is full of applause, supportive comments,\u201d a Facebook user who goes by the name Duong Hoai Linh posted on the government site Thursday. \u201cContrary opinions are all deleted and blocked. So is there freedom of speech?\u201d \nThe user\u2019s comments were later deleted, though it\u2019s unclear by whom.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Facebook, Inc. was 97.11000061035156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Facebook, Inc. was ",
