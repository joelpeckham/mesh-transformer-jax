The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMy cautious view on gold was highlighted last week and on numerous times earlier. \nFor that matter, the broad drop in the price of many commodities has continued -- oil, steel, copper and so forth. \nIt's not only gold bugs who are worried, as many countries and regions are commodities-dependent . Position: None \nGM Driving to Higher Ground Originally published at 10:17 A.M. EDT on July 23, 2015 \nDo wonders never cease? \nThe inexorable share price decline of General Motors ( GM - Get Report ) should now be stemmed after this morning's solid beat. \nAdjusted earnings per share of $1.29 were 20 cents better than consensus expectations principally due to strength in North America. \nEqually important, EBIT came in at $2.9 billion, which was $500 million ahead of forecasts, and operating margins set a company record at 7.5%. Imagine what would happen if Europe improved! \nCiting an expected second-half improvement in profits and cash flow, GM sees sustainable China joint venture profits, which have been a question mark moving forward. \nI see a steady improvement in the company's return on capital and profits in 2016, with EPS close to $5.75, which would be well ahead of this year's estimate of $4.60 per share. \nWith an historically low valuation of less than 6x next year, a dividend yield of 4.7% and a free cash flow yield estimated at above 15% for 2016, I am sticking with this undervalued stock, which seems to be more than discounting \"peak autos.\" \nI have been a consistent buyer of GM on the recent weakness and will add with a limit at $31.75 today. (I just added!) Position: Long GM\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of General Motors Company was 25.318275451660156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of General Motors Company was ",
