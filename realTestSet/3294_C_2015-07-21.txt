REUTERS/Kham - \nBy Richa Naidu \n(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc's (C.N) consumer bank has been ordered to pay $700 million (\u00a3450 million) in relief to borrowers for illegal credit card practices, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. \nThe CFPB, set up under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act aimed at reforming Wall Street, has been cracking down in recent years on credit card companies offering payment protection, credit score tracking and other add-on products. \nCiti will also pay civil penalties of $35 million each to the consumer finance watchdog and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. \nThe settlement is the CFPB's tenth such case, Director Richard Cordray said in a statement on Tuesday. ( http://1.usa.gov/1Dsmone ) \n\"They (the CFPB) are just marching through the industry,\" FBR & Co financial policy analyst Edward Mills told Reuters. \n\"The CFPB loves to have big numbers like this, especially when the largest percentage of the fine goes back to customers because there's a lot of (political) push-back about the cost of the CFPB and the way they're funded.\" \nOther major U.S. banks under that have been fined over credit card misconduct include JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). \nFINE DETAILS \nTuesday's settlement is about 1 percent of the bank's estimated revenue for 2015, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. \n\"Citi is fully reserved to pay costs associated with the agreements,\" the bank said in a statement. \nAs of May 21, Citi had paid out over $17 billion in fines and settlements since the financial crisis. \nThe CFPB said that about 7 million customer accounts were affected by Citibank's \"deceptive marketing\" practices, which included misrepresenting costs and fees and charging customers for services they did not receive. \nA Citibank unit also \"deceptively\" charged nearly 1.8 million consumer accounts often unnecessary same-day payment fees while collecting payments, the CFPB said. \nCiti said it had been issuing refunds and had stopped selling products that were part of its agreements with the regulators, including credit monitoring and debt protection products. \nCapital One Financial Corp (COF.N), American Express Co (AXP.N) and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) are among other card issuers that have been fined by the CFPB since 2012. \nCiti shares were up 0.5 percent at $59.13 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. \n(Additional reporting by Elvina Nawaguna in Washington)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Citigroup, Inc. was 50.90678405761719 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Citigroup, Inc. was ",
