The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n* Ryanair ups FY profit forecast by 25 pct \n* Cites European weather, weak short-haul capacity growth \n* Still sees fare war this winter \n* Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) open up 10 percent at all-time high (Updates with share price, details of winter fare falls, adds CEO quote) \nBy Conor Humphries \nDUBLIN, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Ryanair shares soared to an all-time high on Wednesday after the airline hiked its annual profit forecast by 25 percent on strong summer fare growth, helped by bad weather in northern Europe and retrenchment by rivals. \nThe Irish carrier, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, said it now expects net profit of between 1.18 billion euros ($1.3 billion) and 1.23 billion in the 12 months through March 2016, up from an earlier forecast of 940 million to 970 million. \nRyanair, whose hub at Stansted in eastern England serves destinations including holiday hotspots such as Alicante, Corfu and Ibiza, credited part of the growth to the success of its two-year old drive to improve customer service, \nBut it said poor weather in northern European markets, lower oil prices, the strength of sterling and a lack of new capacity on European short-haul services were key factors. \n\"The softer approach to customer care appears to be paying dividends,\" Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in a video statement. \"But I would credit more of this to there being generally benign industry factors across Europe this summer.\" \nO'Leary also pointed to unexpectedly strong late demand for flights as helping push up prices. Average fares in the six months to end-September were up 2 percent on a year ago, bettering the company's forecast that they would be flat, and impressive given Ryanair expanded capacity by 13 percent at the time. \nRyanair shares hit an all time high of 14.27 euros in early trade, up 10 percent, while its main rival EasyJet (Other OTC: EJTTF - news ) was up 2.6 percent, having already signalled an improved outlook. \nEasyJet last week raised its annual profit forecast to between 675 million pounds ($1.04 billion)and 700 million after record demand for beach holidays and city breaks. \nLufthansa, which Ryanair is targeting with a major expansion in Germany, also said last week it had experienced its strongest summer ever, with business substantially better in July and August than expected. \nRyanair said it still expected sustained fare wars across Europe this winter, but added that fares in the three months to the end of December would be flat, withdrawing an earlier forecast that they would fall by between 4 and 8 percent. \nFares will still drop by between 2 and 4 percent in the three months to March, traditionally the weakest of the year, as Ryanair boosts capacity by 20 percent. \nRyanair filled 95 percent of its seats in July and August and said it expected to fill an average of 91 percent across its financial year, up from an earlier forecast of 90 percent. \n($1 = 0.8966 euros)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ryanair Holdings plc was 77.8902359008789 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Ryanair Holdings plc was ",
