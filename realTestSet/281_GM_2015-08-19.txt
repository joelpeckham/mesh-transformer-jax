That can cause the low-beam headlamps and daytime running lights to fail. Dealers will replace the module with an existing part until a permanent repair is developed and installed. GM said Tuesday it knows of no crashes or injuries from the problem. \nThe recall expansion came after U.S. safety regulators sent the Detroit company a list of consumer complaints about headlight failures in GM cars. \nVehicles that were repaired under the first recall in November of 2014 will have to be repaired again because the replacement part can fail and cut off the headlights, spokesman Alan Adler said. \nThe 2014 recall affected 316,357 vehicles from 2006 through 2009 including the LaCrosse, Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Saab 9-7X and Isuzu Ascender.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of General Motors Company was 25.84811782836914 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of General Motors Company was ",
