EU Probe Into Disney Prices By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News \u2013 2 hours 21 minutes ago \n\nDisneyland Paris is being investigated by the EU for allegedly overcharging British and German visitors. \nThe probe, which follows complaints from members of the public, is the first move in a wider campaign against price discrimination in Europe, known as geo-blocking. \nIt has emerged that in some cases French consumers are asked to pay \u20ac1,346 (\u00a3953) for a premium package while Brits are charged \u20ac1,870 (\u00a31,324) and Germans \u20ac2,447 (\u00a31,733). \nThe European Commission has ordered the French authorities to find out whether the theme park is unfairly rigging prices \nConsumers have accused Euro Disney (Paris: FR0010540740 - news ) of illegally blocking their access to cheap deals available to residents of France or Belgium. \nThis is mostly achieved through residence-based payment and delivery rules, selective offers or by redirecting consumers to their national websites. \nElzbieta Bienkowska, the EU commissioner for the single market, is quoted by the Financial Times as saying the complaints \"were very significant, particularly in one or two instances\". \nShe (Munich: SOQ.MU - news ) added: \"It is time to get to the bottom of this. I am interested in answers and explanations. On the face of it, I struggle to see what objective justification there could be for these practices.\" \nUnder EU rules prices can be varied according to nationality if there are objective reasons, such as different market conditions or different holiday periods. \nDisneyland Paris said in a statement: \"When purchased directly with Disneyland Paris, the cost of a basic resort package - without promotional offers - is identical across all markets, give or take exchange rates. \n\"Throughout the year we try to attract guests from different markets by offering market-specific 'book-by' promotions that can include discounts. \n\"Those promotions take into consideration factors specific to people in the local market, such as their school holiday calendar and booking patterns. \n\"Anyone aware of a promotion running in a market not local to them, can contact the Central Reservations Office and request to make that specific booking.\" \nBrussels is also weighing up complaints against firms in the retail and services sector including Amazon \nSpanish hoteliers and Austrian ski-lift operators are also under the microscope - along with Venice\u2019s public lavatory system.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 31.96523666381836 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
