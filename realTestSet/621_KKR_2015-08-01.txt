 "context": "The following article called 'Jerome Kohlberg, KKR Co-Founder Who Left Firm, Dies at 90' was published on 2015-08-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nContent preferences Done \nJerome Kohlberg Jr., who orchestrated the creation of the leveraged-buyout powerhouse Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. -- today\u2019s KKR & Co. -- only to walk away following a bitter struggle with his two younger partners, has died. He was 90. \nKohlberg died on July 30 at his home in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, according to the New York Times, citing his son, James. The cause was cancer, which was diagnosed two decades ago. \nThe \u201cspiritual father of the entire LBO industry,\u201d as Fortune magazine called him, Kohlberg set out in 1976 to create an investment firm based not on earning commissions but on taking controlling equity stakes in companies at crossroads. He started the firm with Henry Kravis and George Roberts, two colleagues of his at Bear Stearns & Co. who were 18 years his junior. \nMore from Bloomberg.com: Why the Trail of Clues to Flight 370 Now Leads to France \n\u201cJerry was a real visionary, having played an important role in developing the private equity model in the 1960s, and he was a true mentor to George Roberts and me,\u201d Kravis said in an e-mailed statement. Kohlberg was \u201ca man of integrity and moral courage\u201d who \u201cgave freely of his time and wealth,\u201d Roberts said in the statement. Personal Stake\n\u201cI liked the idea of surviving on what you did, on what you were building with your own money,\u201d Kohlberg told Eric J. Weiner for \u201cWhat Goes Up,\u201d a 2005 book about Wall Street\u2019s history. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to just collect a fee or a commission.\u201d \nMore from Bloomberg.com: The CEO Worshipped by His Workers Is Back and Better Than Ever \nExpanding a practice they had begun at Bear Stearns, Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts would borrow large sums from institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies to purchase underperforming companies from shareholders. They would typically retain management and cut staff, unload unprofitable assets and end costly perks such as private airplanes, then sell the company in whole or in pieces within several years. \n\u201cI think the thing I brought to the buyout business more than anything else was the idea that management had to be an integral part of what we were doing,\u201d Kohlberg said. \u201cThey had to have ownership in the business, something at stake. We made them buy stock and also gave them some options, so that they were on the same side of the table as we were.\u201d \nMore from Bloomberg.com: Warren Buffett's Family Secretly Funded a Birth Control Revolution Breakthrough Buyout\nTheir 1979 purchase of Houdaille Industries, a maker of automobile and aircraft equipment, for about $370 million was the first buyout of a large company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \nThe firm pulled off several billion-dollar buyouts in the 1980s, including those of Wometco Enterprises, owner of cable systems and the CBS affiliate in Miami, for about $1 billion in 1984; the Beatrice Cos., a food processor, in 1986 for about $6 billion; and supermarket chain Safeway Stores Inc. in 1986 for about $4 billion. \nAs of 1988, the firm had completed more than 35 buyouts worth more than $40 billion, earning billions of dollars in profits, the New York Times reported at the time. \nThe firm\u2019s partners rose quickly into the ranks of America\u2019s wealthy. Kohlberg spent several years on the Forbes list of 400 richest Americans, with an estimated wealth that reached $1.5 billion in 2007 and 2008. Friction Develops\nAll was not happy inside KKR, however. In 1984, as the firm accelerated its deal-making, Kohlberg was sidelined for months after undergoing surgery for a benign brain tumor. Disagreements grew between Kohlberg and his younger partners about the firm\u2019s direction. The final straw, by most accounts, was the Beatrice buyout, the firm\u2019s first hostile takeover. \nIn 1987, Kohlberg warned in a speech about the \u201coverpowering greed that pervades our business life\u201d and that it could \u201ckill the golden goose.\u201d Soon afterward, he withdrew as a general partner. With his son he created another buyout firm, Kohlberg and Co. \n\u201cI won\u2019t restrict myself to small transactions, but I\u2019ll stick with deals where reason still prevails,\u201d he told the New York Times. \nKohlberg had become known as \u201cDr. No\u201d inside the firm as his younger and more aggressive partners pressed for more deals and more staff, Bryan Burrough and John Helyar wrote in \u201cBarbarians at the Gate,\u201d their account of KKR\u2019s 1989 acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. for $30.1 billion. Pushed Aside\nGeorge Anders, in \u201c Merchants of Debt: KKR and the Mortgaging of American Business \u201d (1992), wrote: \u201cAs his importance at KKR waned, Kohlberg turned angry and then bitter toward his younger partners. Kravis, determined to take the lead in the New York office, began to elbow his former mentor aside.\u201d \nThough Kohlberg\u2019s name remained on the partnership after his departure, the firm hasn\u2019t celebrated his role in its history. \u201cIt was the partnership of our founders, Henry Kravis and George Roberts, that set the tone for KKR\u2019s values and the way our firm would conduct business for decades to come,\u201d according to the firm\u2019s website . \nJerome Spiegel Kohlberg Jr. was born on July 10, 1925, and grew up in the New York City suburbs of Westchester County, where he attended public schools. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Swarthmore College in 1946 while participating in a U.S. Navy officer training program on campus. He later earned a law degree from Columbia University and a master\u2019s degree in business administration from Harvard University. Bear Stearns\nHe began work on buyouts at Bear Stearns in the 1960s, when, he said, they were known as \u201cbootstrap deals\u201d and \u201cbuying anything with over 50 percent debt was ungentlemanly.\u201d (JPMorgan Chase & Co. acquired Bear Stearns in 2008.) \nKravis and Roberts, who are cousins, worked under Kohlberg in Bear Stearns\u2019 corporate-finance division -- Kravis in New York, Roberts in San Francisco. Kravis said the three were mostly left alone, since the firm\u2019s other partners were interested in fees for closing deals, not acquiring long-term equity stakes in companies. \nWhen Kohlberg decided to strike out on his own, Roberts and Kravis joined him. Kohlberg put up $100,000 in startup funding; Roberts and Kravis each invested $10,000. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts opened its doors on May 1, 1976, in midtown Manhattan. \nFollowing his retirement from Kohlberg & Co. in 1994, Kohlberg helped manage his family foundation . With Nancy, his wife, Kohlberg in 2010 purchased the Vineyard Gazette, a weekly newspaper on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, from the family of James \u201cScotty\u201d Reston, the longtime New York Times editor and columnist. \nThe couple, who also resided in Mount Kisco, New York, had four children. \nWith assistance from David Carey and Devin Banerjee in New York. \nMore from Bloomberg.com\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of KKR & Co.
