The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWed, Jul 1, 2015, 7:01 PM AEST - Australia Markets closed 60 jobs cut by NBN contractor in Tasmania AAP \u2013 32 minutes ago Print \nLabor is calling for federal government intervention after the sacking of 60 workers by a contractor responsible for rolling out the NBN across vast areas of Tasmania. \nVisionstream on Wednesday confirmed the possibility of redundancies from its Tasmanian workforce, with a spokeswoman saying that as the project advanced, a different range of skills was needed. \n\"The revised mix of work means we need to change current staffing ratios,\" she told News Corp Australia, adding that there may be redeployment opportunities. \nTasmanian Labor MP Julie Collins said the job cuts show the coalition's lack of oversight and protection for workers in a project which has already suffered months of delays. \nShe wants Communication Minister Malcolm Turnbull to take responsibility. \n\"Mr Turnbull should come to Tasmania and sort these issues out now before it costs more Tasmanian jobs,\" Ms Collins said. \nA spokesman for the minister said staffing is a matter for the individual companies. \n\"It was heartening to see Visionstream taking steps to ensure that workers are given adequate notice of the changes and is taking steps to retrain and redeploy workers,\" the spokesman said. \nCommunications, Electrical and Plumbing Union secretary Trevor Gauld says 40 Hobart-based positions will go, along with 20 in Launceston, and that most of the jobs cut are permanent roles. \nWorkers were told the news during a meeting on Wednesday morning, when Mr Gauld said they were refused union representation. \n\"They read a list of 40 names who were told to wait while everyone else was sent back to work,\" he said. \n\"One by one, they called the 40 workers into a room and told them consultation was finished and their employment was terminated effective immediately.\" \nHe said the move will slow the pace of the rollout and damage worker morale. \nMr Turnbull's office said the NBN rollout across Tasmania has \"picked up considerable pace\" and by the end of 2016 will cover 237,000 premises. \nNBN Co has been contacted for comment. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Northeast Bancorp was 9.80172348022461 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Northeast Bancorp was ",
