 "context": "The following article called 'Olivier Brousse: Using his 'Coca-Cola secret recipe' to solve infrastructure problems' was published on 2015-08-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n27.21 +0.51 \nOvercrowded railways and congested roads scare the boss of John Laing (LSE: JLG.L - news ) but he's ready to provide the long-term solution \nFor someone describing a bleak future, John Laing chief executive Olivier Brousse is pretty upbeat. Sitting in the infrastructure investment and management group\u2019s Kingsway offices in central London, the Frenchman paints a picture of even more dangerously overcrowded trains, roads choked by traffic and air polluted by creaking power stations. \n\u201cThe Tube is already running over capacity, there\u2019s just too many people. I\u2019m scared to get on it sometimes. There was almost a riot at London Bridge Station, the police were called,\u201d says the man who has good reason to be wary of the train-travelling public. He was once something of a hate figure when in charge at Connex. \n\u201cThe population is growing out of control, there\u2019s going to be another 15m people in Britain over the next 15 years, that\u2019s equivalent to two cities the size of London now\u2026 what are we going to do to house, transport and take care of those people?\u201d \nThe reason Brousse is so cheerful about this seemingly gloomy future is that he claims to have the solution to it, not just in Britain but also in other countries where John Laing operates public-private partnerships (PPPs). If governments ask, he says, his company can help solve the problems. \nJohn Laing will raise the money to build the roads, railways, schools and hospitals required, manage their construction and earn a return when they are delivered, though the charges the industry takes have raised eyebrows among some. \nBut, he says, governments need to act fast. \u201cThe problem with infrastructure is that it takes years to think through, plan and deliver. Our projects take 15 years from idea to delivery, but they are fundamental - every time we invest they have an impact on people\u2019s lives their education, health or commute.\u201d \nBrousse regards such problems as solvable, as long as governments make \u201cbold\u201d decisions. The saga over a new runway in the South East is an example of the failure to do so. \n\u201cAt some stage, governments will have to make decisions about adding [infrastructure] capacity and spending because things will just get worse. What\u2019s the alternative?\u201d he adds, darkly. \nAnother obstacle is educating the public about the benefits of having the private sector deliver services or infrastructure that are usually the responsibility of the state. Here Brousse has real insight into how the public can feel about such takeovers. He became a reviled figure among London commuters 15 years ago, when he ran Connex, the much-criticised company running trains from the South into the capital and the first to be sacked for its poor performance. \n\u201cIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) was six years of hell and back,\u201d he says. \u201cBut absolutely I don\u2019t regret it: I\u2019ve only good memories looking back.\u201d \nAfter Connex, Brousse had similar transportation roles for its French parent company, Veolia, then went to waste and water utility group Saur in his native country, before joining John Laing last year. \n\u201cI\u2019ve always worked in private businesses that have an impact on people\u2019s daily life,\u201d he says. A constant aspect of this public service is justifying why the private sector should be involved. \n\u201cWe have to explain it\u2019s not just free profit, that we have risks and responsibilities if we get it wrong,\u201d he says, adding that often people confuse delegation of public services with them being privatised. \u201cPrivatisation is very rare,\u201d he adds. \nThe Frenchman is something of an Anglophile when it comes to PPP; in fact, Brousse says the British invented it during the industrial revolution. \u201cThat was based entirely on PPP: no canal, railway or infrastructure would have been built in Britain in the 19th century without it,\u201d he says, adding that it was refined with post-war reconstruction of bombed cities and perfected with the PFI Act of John Major\u2019s government in 1992. \u201cSince then, the UK has done more PPPs than anywhere in the world maybe 500 and how many have gone wrong? Five, 10, 20?\u201d \nHe admits to some \u201cspectacular\u201d failures, such as Tubelines, but says a few had to fail to learn how to do them correctly. \u201cFor the few failures, how many schools and hospitals have been built?\u201d he asks. \nBrousse believes PPPs fail when the contracts are poorly designed such as a toll road where a company has no control over the number of cars in use or risk is not properly allocated. \nWith so much British experience in PPPs, Brousse sees John Laing\u2019s role as exporting the idea. \n\u201cIt\u2019s like the Coca-Cola concentrate, we have this best practice based on British law and financial frameworks. We try to spread that British concentrate around the world through my team of \u2018bottlers\u2019,\u201d Brousse says. \u201cInvestors like what we do and ask how we can grow, they ask how my \u2018bottlers\u2019 are doing.\u201d \nHe admits that while the merits of PPP might be debated here, the rest of the world is just catching up, with the US and China particularly keen. While the UK and John Laing specifically can make a living out of exporting its experience, the UK needs to be audacious and embrace it to solve the coming problems, according to Brousse. He believes the cheap money created by low interest rates offers a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d opportunity that presents the chance for an \u201cinfrastructure moonshot\u201d. \n\u201cIt is not a funding problem, it\u2019s public policy problem,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity, but what is the alternative? Do we decide something today or wait until it\u2019s more costly and difficult? But the status quo is really not an option.\u201d \nAction would boost John Laing. Its interim results last week revealed the net asset value of its 100 or so investments rose \u00a351m to \u00a3822m. But, while the company is ticking along, currency headwinds contributed to a 68pc drop in pre-tax profits to \u00a332.6m, so a surge in demand for PPP would certainly mean more demand for Brousse. The shares are up 10pc on the flotation price of 195p when the group returned to life as a public listed company in February, having been taken private by Henderson in 2007. \nIncidentally, there\u2019s still confusion among some about what John Laing does: while it manages construction projects, it doesn\u2019t do any building itself, having sold off that arm more than a decade ago, and once work is completed it is not interested in running the bridges, stadiums and railways; sister company John Laing Infrastructure Fund can handle that. \nBut there\u2019s no argument for a tidying-up exercise, claims Brousse: clients appreciate who they are. \n\u201cJohn Laing is like having an \u2018Intel (Swiss: INTC.SW - news ) inside\u2019 sticker on a computer,\u201d says Brousse. \u201cYou might not understand, but you know it\u2019s going to work.\u201d \n= CV = \nName: Olivier Brousse Position: Chief executive, John Laing Age: 50 Career: Executive chairman and director general of water management group Saur; chief executive Veolia Transport; general manager Connex.
