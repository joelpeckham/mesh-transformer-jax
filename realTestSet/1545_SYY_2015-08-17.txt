By Daren Fonda See my bio, plus links to all my recent stories. , August 17, 2015 \nFood service giant Sysco (symbol SYY , $41.38) has been plodding along without much success of late. The Houston-based company\u2019s profits peaked in the fiscal year that ended in June 2011, and it recently dropped a bid to buy its largest rival, US Foods, after a federal judge blocked the proposed merger as anti-competitive.

For starters, activist investor Nelzon Peltz has climbed on board. Peltz\u2019s firm, Trian Holdings, disclosed a 7.1% stake in Sysco on August 14, and he\u2019s likely to aggressively push the firm to bolster profits and return more capital to shareholders via stock buybacks or dividends. Peltz may also lobby for a seat on Sysco\u2019s board of directors to press his case. The stock jumped 7.4% on August 14. \nFor now, Sysco\u2019s growth plan involves buying smaller food distributors, making inroads into new geographic markets, and using software and other technologies to make deliveries more efficient. Sysco, which delivers food to restaurants, hotels, schools and other institutions, is also trying to boost sales to local businesses, which tend to be more profitable than sales to restaurant chains (those big brands account for about 14% of annual sales).

Some analysts say Sysco is still a show-me stock. The company\u2019s previous cost-cutting plan generated more than $750 million in savings in recent years, but it didn\u2019t produce higher profits, says Deutsche Bank analyst Karen Short. For now, it\u2019s unclear how much of Sysco\u2019s new plan will lift earnings or be \u201cswallowed by industry headwinds,\u201d such as weak consumer spending, food price deflation and potentially higher energy costs down the road. \nPatience with the stock should pay off, though. For starters, there\u2019s the quarterly dividend, currently $0.30 per share. Sysco pays out about 65% of earnings to shareholders, a relatively high percentage of its profits. But it hasn\u2019t missed a payment since 1972, and it has raised its cash dividend annually since 1976, including during the lean years of the 2007-09 recession. \nAt its August 14 closing price, the stock yields 2.9%. Assuming earnings can climb 5% a year, on average, the stock should deliver a total return of roughly 8%. That isn\u2019t a tall order, considering that Wall Street expects profits to rise 7%, to $1.97 per share, in the fiscal year that ends in June 2016. At about 21 times estimated earnings for the next four quarters, Sysco trades at a slightly higher price-earnings ratio than the five-year average P/E of 18. But if any of its expansion plans pay off, profit growth is likely to accelerate, potentially pushing up the stock\u2019s P/E, too. \nYet with Peltz now lobbying for changes, the stock could quickly move higher. And even without his involvement, it shouldn\u2019t take much for Sysco shares to serve up tasty gains.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Sysco Corporation was 35.27126693725586 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Sysco Corporation was ",
