In grand Vegas style, the event made accessible to a Las Vegas audience a traditional Japanese art form with a rich history spanning more than 400 years. Panasonic Presents Kabuki Spectacle at Fountains of Bellagio is the first in a series of projects to create a new entertainment form with elements of Kabuki. \u201cJapan Kabuki Festival\u201d with Kabuki performances and related events, is being planned for May 2016 in Las Vegas. On a special stage that floated above the Bellagio Hotel\u2019s world-famous artificial lake, lead actors Ichikawa Somegoro and Nakamura Yonekichi delivered a stunning performance of \u201cNew Kabuki\u201d\u2013 combining the Japanese traditional summer Kabuki title \u201cFight with a Carp\u201d with fantastical modern digital art. The grandiosity of the stage performance drew tens of thousands of spectators in total over five performances. Panasonic holds the world\u2019s largest share of industrial projectors in the 5,000 lumen-plus brightness range, according to data provided by PMA Research. The projectors used for this spectacle are the same type as those that powered the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony. \u201cThis incredible digital art performance combined with an unconventional setting -- the surface of a man-made lake \u2013 demonstrates how AV projection can push the boundaries of entertainment,\u201d said Joseph M. Taylor, Chairman & CEO of Panasonic Corporation of North America. \u201cWorking with partners like Shochiku and teamLab in this project allows Panasonic to demonstrate new kinds of high-impact visual solutions for our B-to-B customers that will keep their audiences coming back. And it allows us to highlight the key features of our compact, lightweight and high-performance projectors.\u201d When it came to Panasonic\u2019s decision to partner with Shochiku, it was very much about a shared philosophy. \u201cWe can appreciate Shochiku\u2019s efforts to always create something new while, at the same time, carrying on a tradition,\u201d said Executive Officer of Panasonic Corporation in charge of Groupwide Brand Communications Division Satoshi Takeyasu. The shared goal here, as pointed out by Mr. Takeyasu, is to communicate a rare and beautiful part of Japanese culture to people in other countries who have not experienced it yet. \u201cWe hope it will leave an indelible impression of Kabuki and surprise and inspire everyone who sees it,\u201d he said.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Las Vegas Sands Corp. was 40.56269454956055 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Las Vegas Sands Corp. was ",
