 "context": "The following article called 'Price & Time: S&P 500 Down to Go Up?' was published on 2015-07-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n*.7555 Focus Chart of the Day : S&P 500 The S&P 500 has continued with its recent trend of \u201chaving to go down before up\u201d. After a very volatile few days last week with two successive closes below the 200-day moving average the index is suddenly again in a strong position. Yesterday\u2019s move through a key confluence of resistance near 2100 (50-day moving average, median line channel, 61.8% retracement of May- July decline) was potentially an important change in behavior and warns a more meaningful move higher is taking shape. The 78.6% retracement of the May \u2013July decline at 2116 is immediate resistance, but a close over 2130 is really needed to trigger an important upside push. Weakness back under 2087 would be a cause for concern.
