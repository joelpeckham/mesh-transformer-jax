Result of FB's Thursday Outage By Zacks Equity Research 50 minutes ago \ue071 Content preferences Done \u201cHello to all the people millions of people that dusted off their twitter account to see what's happening when #facebookdown \u201c \u2014 John H.@johnweb We think this tweet sums up what happened yesterday when Facebook FB users experienced a brief outage \u2014 Twitter Inc.\u2019s TWTR traffic picked up! And that\u2019s because many turned to Twitter to vent their frustration or gag about the incident. Currently Down, the monitoring website, stated that Facebook was offline for approximately 14 minutes from about 1630 GMT. However, others websites gave varying estimates. Facebook did not comment on the outage. Let\u2019s Turn to Twitter Similar to previous such incidents, this one also led to a series of \u201cpanicked -- and mock-panicked\u201d tweets. The #facebookdown theme went on to become a \u201cglobal trending item on the messaging platform\u201d according to 9news.com. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all cool now! \u201cFB users r roaming the streets nn tears, showing pictures of themselves in other people's faces yelling 'Do you like this'? #FacebookDown\u201d (sic) \u2014 Amir Sohail (@ItsAmirSohail) Don\u2019t worry, though, Facebook is up and running now!. On a More Serious Note Apart from all the witty tweets and gags, it\u2019s important to remember that outage affects revenues too because of the loss in advertising. According to The Street, \u201cFacebook is missing out on the potential for a loss of slightly more than $1.7 million in advertising-centric revenue for every hour the website and app are not working.\u201d This is based on the fact that the company generated $3.827 billion in advertising revenues in the second quarter, assuming flat revenue growth rate. Facebook currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the same space are Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Travelport Worldwide Ltd. TVPT sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
