U.S. stock index futures indicated a lower open on Friday with investors eyeing the latest release of U.S. jobs data. \nU.S. stock index futures were slightly lower on Friday with investors eyeing the latest release of U.S. jobs data, which are due at 8:30 a.m. ET. \nThe economy is expected to have added 223,000 nonfarm payrolls in July, enough to allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to pull the trigger on its first rate hike in nine years. \nThe Fed will consider a possible first rate hike at its September 16 and 17 meeting, but economists say that even with a strong jobs report, it is far from clear cut when the central will move off of the zero fed funds target rate it has had in place since late 2008. \nAround the world, central banks appear slow to want to cut their monetary stimulus.
