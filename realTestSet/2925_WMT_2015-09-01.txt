The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEnlarge Walmart Just months after winning praise for increasing wages for its workers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) has cut the hours of many employees. In February, Wal-Mart announced plans to increase wages for its entry-level employees. Wal-Mart Stores said it is increasing wages for 40 percent of its workforce company-wide, which is nearly half a million people, after the retailer reported the first increase in shopper traffic in more than two years. The cost of that wage increase has been estimated at more than $1 billion, and it seems as though the retailer is offsetting that cost with cuts to employee hours. The reductions have began weeks ago, during the busy back-to-school shopping period. \"Managing hours is a routine part of running a sustainable operation,\" Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in a statement to CNBC . \"And in select number of stores, it requires keeping those hours to what was originally budgeted.\" Wal-Mart is the No. 10 largest employer in Memphis, with more than 5,300 employees in the area. The retail giant said all of its domestic workers will earn at least $9/hour by April 2015. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25/hour. \nGet Memphis Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 56.36765670776367 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
