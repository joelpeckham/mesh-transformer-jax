Photo: Bloomberg News By 2 COMMENTS \nFacebook Inc. FB 0.08 % is vying to bring virtual reality to your phone. \nThe social network is working on a stand-alone video app that would support 360-degree or \u201cspherical\u201d videos, people familiar with the matter said. The format, typically compiled from multiple cameras, allows users to change their viewing perspective by tilting their phones. \nAs conceived, the app would work on many platforms including Apple Inc.\u2019s devices and those using Google Inc.\u2019s Android operating system. Development of the app is in early stages and it is unclear when or if the app will launch, said the people, who declined to be named discussing the confidential project. \nFacebook declined to comment. \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly called virtual reality the next \u201ccomputing platform\u201d after mobile devices. Hype around virtual reality has waxed and waned over the last three decades, but Facebook\u2019s $2 billion acquisition of Oculus VR last year sparked renewed interest and investment in the sector. \nIn March, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook would support spherical video in its news feed, saying users would be able to \u201cmove around inside the video and view it from different angles.\u201d \nOculus is expected to ship a consumer version of its Rift headset in the first quarter of next year. Mr. Zuckerberg hopes the Oculus headset will power a host of new \u201cimmersive\u201d experiences, from virtual doctor appointments to live concerts to courtside seats at a basketball game. \n\u201cOculus firmly believes that VR will initially be popular with hard-core gamers and enthusiasts who are willing to invest in high-end desktop computers for gaming for the next two years,\u201d said Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler in a research note Friday. \u201cZuckerberg\u2019s own vision is much broader than this, but it may take a few years to play out.\u201d \nA mobile-video app would offer a less immersive experience than a headset. But an app would help extend Facebook\u2019s presence in virtual reality beyond Oculus and introduce the technology to a much larger audience. \nDeutsche Bank estimates Oculus will sell about 1.5 million headsets next year. By comparison, world-wide mobile phone shipments will exceed two billion that same year, according to market-research firm Gartner. \nLast year, Google unveiled a virtual-reality viewer it calls Cardboard and was the lead investor in a $542 million round of funding for Magic Leap Inc., a Florida-based startup working on a head-mounted display that projects 3-D images over objects in the real world. \nSamsung Electronics Co. SSNHZ 0.00 % teamed up with Oculus to make the Gear VR headset due later this year. Sony Corp. SNE 0.89 % has developed its own headset called Project Morpheus. \nIn May, Google introduced tools to make it easier to create spherical videos. Its Jump camera rig includes 16 GoPro GPRO -4.31 % devices that capture 360-degree, three-dimensional pictures and video. YouTube supports those videos and there are more than 400,000 subscribers to its #360Video channel. \nWrite to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Orr Hirschauge at Orr.Hirschauge@wsj.com 531\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 26.178937911987305 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
