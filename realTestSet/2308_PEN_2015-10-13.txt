The country also exports large quantities to Europe and Asia. \n\"Naturally this the end of the strike. The parties have agreed to a full and final settlement,\" said Peter Bailey, the union's chief negotiator in the coal sector. \nHowever, South Africa's Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) rejected the wage offer, a union official said. \nAround 200 AMCU members went on strike on Oct. 5 at a small coal operation east of Johannesburg.. \nThe union said it was \"not in agreement with the Chamber\", referring to the latest offer tabled the Chamber of Mines, which represents producers in the sector.
