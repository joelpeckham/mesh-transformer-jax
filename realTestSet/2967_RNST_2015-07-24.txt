Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech/T. Pyle \nNASA's Kepler mission has confirmed the first near-Earth-size planet in the \u201chabitable zone\u201d around a sun-like star. This discovery and the introduction of 11 other new small habitable zone candidate planets mark another milestone in the journey to finding another \u201cEarth,\u201d according to the space agency. \nThe newly discovered Kepler-452b is the smallest planet to date discovered orbiting in the habitable zone \u2014 the area around a star where liquid water could pool on the surface of an orbiting planet \u2014 of a G2-type star, like our sun. The confirmation of Kepler-452b brings the total number of confirmed planets to 1,030 . \n\"On the 20th anniversary year of the discovery that proved other suns host planets, the Kepler exoplanet explorer has discovered a planet and star which most closely resemble the Earth and our Sun,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Washington . \u201cThis exciting result brings us one step closer to finding an Earth 2.0.\" \nKepler-452b is 60% larger in diameter than Earth and is considered a super-Earth-size planet. While its mass and composition are not yet determined, previous research suggests that planets the size of Kepler-452b have a good chance of being rocky. \nWhile Kepler-452b is larger than Earth, its 385-day orbit is only 5% longer. The planet is 5% farther from its parent star Kepler-452 than Earth is from the Sun. Kepler-452 is 6bn years old, 1.5bn years older than our sun, has the same temperature, and is 20% brighter and has a diameter 10% larger. \n\"We can think of Kepler-452b as an older, bigger cousin to Earth, providing an opportunity to understand and reflect upon Earth\u2019s evolving environment,\" said Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California , who led the team that discovered Kepler-452b. \"It\u2019s awe-inspiring to consider that this planet has spent 6bn years in the habitable zone of its star; longer than Earth. That\u2019s substantial opportunity for life to arise, should all the necessary ingredients and conditions for life exist on this planet.\u201d \nNASA said that to help confirm the finding and better determine the properties of the Kepler-452 system, the team conducted ground-based observations at the University of Texas at Austin's McDonald Observatory, the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins, Arizona, and the W. M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. These measurements were key for the researchers to confirm the planetary nature of Kepler-452b, to refine the size and brightness of its host star and to better pin down the size of the planet and its orbit. \nThe Kepler-452 system is located 1,400 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus . The research paper reporting this finding has been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal. \nRelated Articles\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Renasant Corporation was 28.22746467590332 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Renasant Corporation was ",
