The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJuly 31, 2015 12:16 am Pension plan makes GM look less enticing The Nikkei has no letters column, so I write to you \nSir, The implied valuation of GM (\u201c General Motors : on the Buffett table\u201d, Lex, July 29) would certainly be enticing if true. Not taken account of in the analysis are several factors, including the company\u2019s vast pension underfunding, which, while listed at $24.1bn at fiscal year-end, is actually closer to $29.4bn when more realistic actuarial assumptions are utilised. Additionally, the failure of GM to fund the plan properly leads investors into believing their cash flows and GAAP results are higher than economic reality would dictate. For instance, for its last fiscal year, GM contributed just $913m versus almost $7.5bn in benefit payments. Such underfunding has taken place each year post the IPO. \nThe upcoming end of federal pension \u2014 MAP 21 \u2014 relief will only add to the burden. In addition, GM\u2019s periodic pension cost, the amount shown on the profit and loss, of just $151m is puny in relation to the true liability and yearly benefit obligations, while inflating both GAAP income and commonly defined cash flows. \nFinally, GM\u2019s financial subsidiaries will require greater amounts of cash if the company is to grow. During its latest fiscal year, GM Financial saw its accounts receivables grow by almost 14 per cent, or $3.9bn. \nAll in all, given these considerations, GM\u2019s cash flow to enterprise value is closer to 8.4 times, rather than Lex\u2019s 3 times. I would thus be quite surprised if Warren Buffett made a play for the entire enterprise. \nKenneth S Hackel Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
