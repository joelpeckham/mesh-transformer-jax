PUBLISHED: 08:50, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 | UPDATED: 09:05, Wed, Jul 1, 2015 GETTY Mounted horses controlling the terrorism threat in Tunisia for holiday goers Too many people leave it to the last minute and only buy insurance days or even hours before they go. But experts warn that without travel cover you will lose everything if you are forced to cancel your holiday before you leave. The danger has increased since holidaymakers started shopping around on the internet to find the cheapest policy, rather than buying expensive cover from their tour operator at the time of booking. Selwyn Fernandes, managing director at insurer LV= Direct, says: \u201cPeople are now gearing up to go on holiday and while most have booked flights and accommodation, all too few buy their travel insurance at the same time.\u201d Without cover, though, you will lose all your money if you fall ill or get injured and cannot travel. He adds: \u201cIf a close relative gets ill and you need to be with them, without travel cover you won\u2019t be able to get any of your money back.\u201d Amber Howard, brand manager at travel website HolidaySafe.co.uk, says: \u201cTravel policies should include cancellation cover, which will pay for a number of problems, including unexpected family illness and, on some policies, if your scheduled airline goes bust.\u201d If a close relative gets ill and you need to be with them, without travel cover you won\u2019t be able to get any of your money back Selwyn Fernandes, managing director at insurer LV= Direct Once you realise your plans are in jeopardy, it is too late to get a policy. Events in Tunisia and Greece are a reminder of the kind of risks people face when travelling overseas but most travel insurance policies won\u2019t pay for cancellation or curtailment following acts of terrorism. Bob Atkinson of the TravelSupermarket.com website says: \u201cIf you have booked a forthcoming trip to Tunisia and want to cancel, you are unlikely to be able to claim, although Saga Travel Insurance has just said it will offer cancellation cover to those who no longer wish to travel there.\u201d In most cases, you are dependent on your travel agent, although many, including Thomson, First Choice and Thomas Cook are allowing customers to amend their Tunisia booking to new destinations free of administration charges. The Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO), which issues advice on which countries are safe to visit, has yet to advise against visiting beach areas in Tunisia. If it does, ATOL-backed travel operators must give you a refund for package tours but travellers who booked independently have no such protection. Atkinson says: \u201cIf things change and the FCO advises against travel, your insurance policy will become invalid if you go anyway.\u201d Britons travelling to Greece have been told to take enough cash for their entire stay as the country\u2019s debt crisis intensifies but many policies won\u2019t cover large sums in case of loss or theft. Although Aviva has recently doubled its cover to \u00a3600, most will only cover between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300, according to new research from comparison site GoCompare.com. And some insurers won\u2019t give you any cover at all if you lose cash on holiday. Only one in 10 will cover cash of \u00a3500 or more. You should also check the excess on any claim as this is typically between \u00a350 and \u00a3100 but can be as high as \u00a3250. Caroline Lloyd at GoCompare. com says: \u201cCover limits, excesses and exclusions vary wildly between travel policies. Make sure you buy a policy with the appropriate cover limit and understand the terms and conditions that apply to cash.\u201d Insurers will expect you to take reasonable care to safeguard against loss, damage or opportunistic thieves, she says: \u201cIf your hotel or apartment has a safe or safety deposit box, use it.\u201d Related articles\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of SIFCO Industries, Inc. was 14.899999618530273 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of SIFCO Industries, Inc. was ",
