Two smaller unions which represent mostly skilled workers and supervisors accepted the coal companies' offers last week. \nLike other mining sectors, coal has been hard hit by sliding commodity prices in the face of slowing Chinese growth, while power and labour costs in South Africa have been rising sharply. \nSouth Africa's mine workers have grown increasingly militant amid perceptions that wages for the mostly black labour force remain too low two decades after the end of apartheid rule. \n($1 = 13.8755 rand) (Editing by James Macharia and William Hardy)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Penumbra, Inc. was 39.599998474121094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Penumbra, Inc. was ",
