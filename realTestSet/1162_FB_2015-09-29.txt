More than half-a-billion shares changed hands, or more than one for every IPO share sold, showing that professional investors thought the offering was overpriced. \nWithin a week, the stock had lost 18% and it kept falling until September, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 whom the IPO had made into one of the world\u2019s richest billionaires \u2014 promised not to sell any more shares. While the pledge from Facebook\u2019s largest shareholder stopped the bleeding, allowing the shares to find a floor around $18, it wasn\u2019t enough to save the stock that first year. \nOne year after the offering, the shares closed at $26.25, or 31% lower than their first day\u2019s closing price. During that same 365 days, the Nasdaq composite gained a whopping 26%. \n\u200bWhen it comes to Internet IPOs that badly lag the returns of the broader market for tech stocks during their first year of trading\u200b, Facebook has plenty of company.\u200b Alibaba, Twitter, Groupon and Zynga all shared that distinction, as we reported here Monday . \nYet Facebook is alone among that group in one \u200bcrucial\u200b aspect: Its shares have not only rebounded \u200bfrom their post-IPO doldrums, \u200bbut have since soared. The shares this week have been trading between $87 and $90 a share, or more than 135% above their IPO price. \nThose who bought after the IPO froth came off the company\u2019s valuation\u200b, then,\u200b have been rewarded wi\u200bth \u200breturns that have trounced the broader market. \nThe Facebook IPO is a reminder of two thing. One is that, in stock buying and selling, timing is everything. It also showed that the IPO process itself sets up a zero-sum game between the listing company and its public investors. \nEvery dollar more that a company raises in the offering is one dollar less left on the table for investors to profit from a subsequent rise in its share price. As with the stock option grants that give to executives and early investors millions of discounted shares, it\u2019s a process that favors insiders over ordinary shareholders. \nInvestors could have done worse than the Facebook IPO, of course. \nThey could have bought IPO shares of Twitter, Zynga or Groupon, the three large Internet offerings of this investment boom that have been least kind to public shareholders. \n(We\u2019ll look at Twitter\u2019s IPO on Wednesday, Zynga\u2019s on Thursday and Groupon\u2019s on Friday.) \nFollow USA TODAY columnist John Shinal on Twitter: @johnshinal. 1 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1FBwdpu TOP VIDEOS\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Facebook, Inc. was 89.20999908447266 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Facebook, Inc. was ",
