Mining majors BHP, Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and Vale have continued to lift production despite a supply glut and softening Chinese demand. \nAs plunging oil prices hit shale gas, BHP has wound back on its gas output, reducing production at its onshore assets in the United States. \nTotal (Swiss: FP.SW - news ) petroleum production dropped by two percent over the June quarter from the same period last year, although overall output for the 2015 financial year edged up by four percent to a record 256 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). \nBut the diversified miner said petroleum production was forecast to decrease by seven percent in the next financial year to 237 MMboe. \n- Natural gas production slips - \nNatural gas production fell by 11 percent in the June quarter. The quarterly decline saw total production for the 2015 financial year drop by six percent to 787 billion cubic feet, amid weaker seasonal demand at Bass Strait and the deferment of developments for onshore US projects. \n\"In petroleum, through improved recoveries and lower drilling costs, we expect to maintain production in the Black Hawk and Permian in the 2016 financial year despite cutting annual shale investment by over 50 percent,\" Mackenzie said. \n\"Although our decision to cut spending in... onshore US will mean deferring gas volumes in the near term, we expect to realise greater value by developing our acreage later.\" \nBHP last week said it was taking a $2.8 billion pre-tax writedown on its US onshore assets as plunging oil prices hit shale gas, with the gas-focused Hawkville field at its Eagle Ford operations in south Texas accounting for most of the charge. \nIt added in Wednesday's update that further additional charges of between $350 million to $650 million were expected in the first six months of this year on the back of impairments and redundancies from copper projects and from onshore US rig terminations. \nBHP in January cut back its operating US shale oil rigs by 40 percent. \nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August rose 21 cents to finish at $50.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange early Wednesday, snapping four straight sessions of losses. \nWorld oil (Other OTC: WOGI - news ) prices collapsed by 60 percent between June 2014 and January when they hit a low of $45, hurt by a global supply glut.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton plc Sponsored ADR was 25.250160217285156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton plc Sponsored ADR was ",
