That move also lowered crude oil prices, widening refineries' potential profits. \nValero planned earlier this year to install a flue gas cooler on the 65,000-bpd FCCU beginning in mid-October, the sources said. \nThe earliest the work can now begin is late October and the refinery is also weighing whether to do the work in early December or early 2016 as part of a planned overhaul that will include the smaller of two crude distillation units and other units at the refinery.
