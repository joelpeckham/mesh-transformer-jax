The video streaming service said subscriptions jumped 3.3 million in the second quarter, with the bulk of the increase outside the US. Earnings were $26 million, down from $71 million a year ago. \n\"It's a big believers story, the way Amazon is,\" said Mace Blicksilver. \"On growth metrics, you must own it.\" \nBlicksilver said the market was further lifted by a confluence of benign events: The passage of an austerity package by the Greek parliament that opens the way to a potential bailout; congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that was seen as dovish on interest rates; and the steadying of the Chinese stock market. \n\"It's hard to see what's to be bearish about at this very moment,\" he said. \nLeading technology companies moved higher, including Apple (Swiss: AAPL.SW - news ) (+1.3 percent), Facebook (+1.2 percent) and Google (+3.5 percent). \nAnother giant tech company, online retailer Amazon, bolted 3.1 percent higher after announcing that customers bought 34.4 million items on Wednesday when it offered special promotions to buyers of its \"Prime\" service, a $99 per-year package delivery program. \nEBay (Xetra: 916529 - news ) surged 3.4 percent as it beat expectations on sales and earnings and confirmed the split off on Friday of subsidiary PayPal. \nCitigroup (NYSE: C - news ) jumped 3.8 percent after reporting second-quarter earnings of $1.51 per share, much above the $1.34 projected by Wall Street analysts. \nDow member Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) fell 0.8 percent as its reported lower second-quarter earnings, dragged down by $1.45 billion in legal charges. \nOther companies to report earnings included chipmaker Intel (Swiss: INTC.SW - news ) (+0.7 percent), tobacco giant Philip Morris International (Xetra: A0NDBJ - news ) (+3.2 percent), paint company Sherwin-Williams (-7.4 percent) and health care giant UnitedHealth Group (-0.7 percent). \nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury dipped to 2.35 percent from 2.36 percent on Wednesday, while the 30-year fell to 3.11 percent from 3.15 percent.
