Analysts at Nomura said the delay was not unusual, maintaining its \"buy\" rating on Shell. \n\"We see no immediate red flags for the Shell-BG deal,\" the bank said in a note. \nConcerns that the deal could face regulatory hurdles and delays as well as low oil prices have stoked investor anxiety in recent months, with BG shares trading at a discount of around 10pc to Shell shares. \nIn response to the regulator's concern about gas sales by Arrow Energy, which is 50-50 owned by Shell and PetroChina (HKSE: 0857-OL.HK - news ) , Shell said BG already had enough gas to meet all its commitments. \n\"Arrow and QCLNG collaboration could assist the development of Arrow's undeveloped resources to potentially accelerate additional gas supplies into both the domestic and export market,\" Shell said. \nThe takeover has already been cleared by EU, US and Brazilian anti-trust authorities. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) still needs approvals from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board and China to go ahead. \nSome of Australia's biggest manufacturers fear Shell's takeover of BG could worsen what they see as a lack of competition in the country's eastern gas market, spurred by three new LNG export plants, including BG's, in Queensland. \n\"This burst in demand for gas over a very short time frame for the LNG industry is effectively upending the east coast gas market,\" Sims said in a speech at a gas conference on Thursday, outlining the commission's preliminary impressions on a review of the east coast gas market due in April 2016. \nHe said the commission had evidence that after the LNG projects were approved, many Australian industrial gas users went from a market where they received three to five offers of supply on negotiable terms to a market where they received no offers or only one true offer on inflexible terms. \nShell, Australian regulators and third parties will hold a discussion over the next eight weeks to consider the issues raised by the ACCC, a Shell spokesman said. \n\"We will continue working with the regulators in Australia to ensure a timely completion of the transaction.\"\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bunge Limited was 58.91268539428711 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bunge Limited was ",
