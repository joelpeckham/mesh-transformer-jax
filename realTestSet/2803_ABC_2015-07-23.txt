The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThu, Jul 23, 2015, 1:18 PM AEST - Australia Markets close in 2 hrs 42 mins ABC to close shopfronts, 300 jobs cut AAP \u2013 2 hours 26 minutes ago Recommend View Photo \n\nThe ABC will close its brick and mortar shops and focus on online retail in a move that will slash 300 jobs. \nMore than 50 ABC stores around the country will close, with the public broadcaster set to start ending leases with landlords. \nThe change to an online shopfront is in keeping with the \"changing retail environment\" said the ABC in a statement released on Thursday morning. \nIn the statement the broadcaster said it was no longer possible for it to sustain a large network of leased stores reliant on the sales of DVDs and CDS. \nThe ABC's retail revenue has traditionally been reliant on products like DVDs, music, books, magazines, toys, novelties and clothing. \nWhile the national broadcaster will continue to manage a branded presence in other retailers like department stores Myer and David Jones, a revised retail strategy will focus largely on its online shop. \nThe head of the Australian Retail Association described the loss of 300 jobs as extremely disappointing. \n\"I accept that this is partly a result of disruptive technology and that retailers have got to re-invent themselves to ensure their longevity,\" said president Russell Zimmerman. \n\"However consumers should have a choice (between physical and online stores),\" he said. \nThe director of ABC Commercial, Robert Patterson, stressed the necessity of the decision and said it had not been taken lightly. \n\"The ABC Shops have been an important part of the ABC's relationship with its audiences for the past 35 years.\" \n\"However, this strategy will create a more cost effective, nimble and flexible approach to servicing customers.\" \nThe broadcaster's retail arm said that the welfare of the hundreds of affected staff would be its primary focus over the coming months. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Hockey still wants to speed up the economy AAP \nTreasurer Joe Hockey says the government is still looking at ways to speed up the economy through greater productivity \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) was 102.99362182617188 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) was ",
