The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n(Repeats Aug. 27 item. The opinions expressed here are those of \nthe author, a columnist for Reuters) \nBy Andy Home \nLONDON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - For every action there is an \nequal and opposite reaction. \nOr translating Sir Isaac Newton's third law of motion into \nfinancial language, markets don't move in straight lines. \nAlthough you'd be forgiven for thinking so after the \npummelling base metals have taken over the last couple of weeks. \nThere are, however, the first tentative signs of stabilisation \nas the selling momentum starts to fade. \nSome sort of short-covering reaction looks likely. Which is \nwhere things might get interesting. \nIt (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) is in the nature of the London Metal Exchange (LME) with \nits singular rolling daily prompt system that buying back a \nshort position or simply holding on to it is not as \nstraightforward an exercise as on a vanilla futures exchange. \nDates need to be adjusted on a buy-back while holding a short \nposition means rolling it forward. \nEither way, it means navigating the potentially choppy \nwaters that are the LME nearby spreads. \nAnd the outlook could be for something a bit worse than \nchoppy, judging by the way front-month spreads are tightening \nright across the base metals suite. \nPHYSICAL SQUEEZE \nThe most extreme example is tin, where the benchmark \ncash-to-three-months spread \n$540-per-tonne backwardation on Aug. 18. \nThat's the widest cash premium since 2009, when what is one \nof the LME's least liquid contracts was subjected to a \nprotracted and painful squeeze. \nThings have eased a little over the last week but as of \nThursday morning's ring sessions the period was still trading at \na hefty $101 backwardation. \nTightness in the LME tin market is easy to understand, \nreflecting more than anything else the low level of available \nstocks in exchange warehouses. \nThere were just 3,940 tonnes of \"live\" on-warrant stocks on \nAug. 17, the lowest tally since late 2012 and a low liquidity \ncover for the three sizeable shorts that were sitting on the \nAug. 18 third-Wednesday prompt date.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Helmerich & Payne, Inc. was 39.31317138671875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Helmerich & Payne, Inc. was ",
