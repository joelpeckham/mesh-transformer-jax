Copper was down 1.2 percent, alongside Chinese equities, after data showed a lower-than-expected rise in China's factory output, reinforcing worries about demand for the metal. \nThe STOXX Europe 600 Basic Resources index fell 1.7 percent, dragged down by a 5.5 percent drop in Glencore (Amsterdam: GX8.AS - news ) and a 3.1 percent weaker Antofagasta (Other OTC: ANFGF - news ) . \nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.5 percent at 1,394.50 points by 1407 GMT. It (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) had risen to a high of 1,414.99 points earlier in the session. \nAlthough the benchmark index is 6 percent higher from a low late last month, it is still down about 14 percent from its peak some two months ago, mainly on concerns about the pace of economic growth in China and the prospects of a U.S (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) . rate hike. \n\"Investors are pretty nervous ahead of the Fed meeting,\" said Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels. \"We are seeing a lot of volatility in the market because liquidity is very low.\" \nThe FTSEurofirst 300's volumes were just 48 percent of its 90-day daily average in late European trading. \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) rose 1.5 percent, with traders saying that the company was benefiting from an upbeat article by Barron's on Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) , which uses ARM designs in its products. \nOn the broader STOXX 600 index, the biggest rise came from TF1. It rose 6.9 percent after the French government decided against allowing advertising on public broadcasters. \nThe market had little reaction to data showing that the euro zone's industrial production was stronger than expected in July, thanks to a higher volume of energy, capital and durable consumer goods. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up (Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was 140.67230224609375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of FedEx Corporation was ",
