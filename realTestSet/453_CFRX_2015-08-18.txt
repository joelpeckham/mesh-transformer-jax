The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTuesday, August 18, 2015 10:53AM IST (5:23AM GMT) (BW)(CA-EASIC/TAMBA) eASIC and Tamba Networks Announce Immediate Availability of 100 Gigabit Ethernet Solution for Data Center, Core and Access Network Switching Applications Calif., Santa Clara, United States eASIC Corp. (@easic), a fabless semiconductor company that delivers a custom integrated circuit (IC) platform (eASIC Platform), and Tamba Networks , a leading developer of connectivity IP cores, announced the immediate availability of a 100 Gigabit Ethernet MAC (media access controller) and PCS (physical coding sublayer) solution for high bandwidth applications, such as data center, and core and access network switching. The combination of the eASIC Nextreme-3 silicon platform and Tamba\u2019s flexible, ultra-low-latency Gigabit Universal Ethernet MAC/PCS cores gives designers a single integrated platform for building IEEE802.3-compliant communications equipment that supports 100G Ethernet and 40GE-KR4, including FEC (forward error correction), link training and auto negotiation. \u201ceASIC is pleased to partner with Tamba to address the growing demand for 100Gbps Ethernet and 40Gbps with KR4 support for designing low latency, efficient multiplexers and distribution equipment,\u201d said eASIC Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Marketing, Jasbinder Bhoot. \u201cThe Tamba IP is fully qualified in the eASIC flow allowing our customers to get started immediately with an easy-to-use, cost-effective solution for getting to market quickly, and achieving higher performance and lower power compared to FPGA alternatives.\u201d \u201cTogether, we\u2019re delivering an efficient silicon platform for Ethernet layer implementation that fully exploits the benefits of Tamba\u2019s compact, configurable, Universal Ethernet MAC/PCS IP cores and the eASIC Nextreme-3 silicon fabric,\u201d said Tamba Networks President, Soren Pedersen. \u201cWith our IP cores, designers can achieve drastic reductions in latency, power consumption, and logic size for next-generation communications equipment. We\u2019re excited to extend those advantages to eASIC customers.\u201d To learn more about Tamba IP for Nextreme-3, go to eZ-IP Intellectual Property Alliance . About Tamba Networks IP Cores Tamba Networks\u2019 portfolio includes IP solutions consisting of a complete family of silicon-proven soft Ethernet and Interlaken cores. With a robust IP development methodology, extensive investment in quality, IP prototyping, and comprehensive technical support, Tamba enables designers to accelerate time-to-market and reduce integration risk, with performance that is absolutely unmatched in the marketplace.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ContraFect Corporation was 53.90999984741211 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ContraFect Corporation was ",
