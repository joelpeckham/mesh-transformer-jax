The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n-0.05 \nBy Zachary Fagenson \nMIAMI (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch will pay up to $28 million to settle a class action lawsuit over Beck's brand labelling that consumers said falsely led them to believe the beer was brewed in Germany under an agreement approved in Florida federal court on Tuesday. \nAttorneys for the affected consumers estimated about 1.7 million households purchased the beer products in question between May 2011 and June 2015. \nAnheuser-Busch agreed to pay 50 cents per six pack, $1 for each 12-pack, and $1.75 for each 20-pack of 12-ounce bottles. Total payments will be capped at $50 for households with proof-of-purchase, and $12 for those without. \nSome 60,000 claims have been filed, and more are expected, said plaintiffs' attorney Tucker Ronzetti at a court hearing. \nAnheuser-Busch also agreed to add labels identifying the Beck's brand as having been made in the United States for the next five years, and to make similar changes to its website. \nThe beer maker also agreed to pay $3.5 million in lawyers\u2019 fees under the agreement approved by U.S. Magistrate Judge John J. O'Sullivan in the U.S. Southern District of Florida. \nThe suit was filed by a Florida man in Oct. 2013, \u201calleging that Beck\u2019s Pilsner had been falsely or misleadingly labelled,\u201d according to court documents. \nIn its settlement, Anheuser-Busch did not admit wrong-doing. \n\"Beck's has always been truthful, transparent and in compliance with all legal requirements,\" Jorn Socquet, vice president of marketing at Anheuser-Busch said in an email. \n(Editing by Letitia Stein, Bernard Orr)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Sponsored ADR (Belgium) was 98.62193298339844 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Sponsored ADR (Belgium) was ",
