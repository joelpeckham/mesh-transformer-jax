The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJake Dean Pamela Patsley is stepping down as CEO of MoneyGram. With MoneyGram International (Nasdaq: MGI) CEO Pamela Patsley nearing the end of her employment contract, the company announced Friday that CFO Alex Holmes will take over the reins on Jan. 1. In a second quarter earnings call, Patsley said she will be stepping down from the CEO position she has held since 2009 as a publicly-filed contract states her tenure is up on Aug. 31. She will serve as executive chairman at MoneyGram through the end of 2017, a role that that will include a greater role in board governance; representing the company to customers, financial representatives and other representatives; and working closely with the company\u2019s charitable arm, the MoneyGram Foundation. \u201cWe were going to have to make some announcement, and in the spirit of great government, good disclosure and continuing to build a good relationship with our shareholders, this was a perfect time,\u201d Patsley told the Dallas Business Journal of her decision to step down. \u201cI think it is really good for the company to give the five-month transition and to be open and honest with investors. And most of all, this is great for MoneyGram and great for Alex.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m happy too,\u201d she added, saying her smaller role will allow her to spend more time with her husband. Holmes, who has worked with Patsley for a decade, was named CFO of MoneyGram in 2009 and COO last year. Patsley has been grooming him to take over her job for several years, she said. \u201cThese are not something where we just said in a meeting \u2018Let\u2019s talk about succession planning\u2019 and then made an announcement a few weeks later, \u201c she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an evolution.\u201d \u201cIn succession planning, if you look back over the past several years, you will see that Alex has had a growing role, increasing responsibilities,\u201d she added. \u201cHad he failed at some of those responsibilities, the board would have had to gone another way. But he succeeded. With the new position, Holmes\u2019 first order of business will be to wrap up financials for the company\u2019s full-year earnings call in February. After that, he will look at expanding MoneyGram\u2019s products and services. \u201cWe really have five months to sort through administrative issues, talk to the team and see where their areas of interest lie and get that taken care of so that by the time we hit Jan. 1, we have 2016 ready to go,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be about moving the company forward.\u201d MoneyGram is the 48th largest publicly-traded company in North Texas, according to the latest Dallas Business Journal research. Patsley is the only female CEO in the DBJ\u2019s 2015 list of the 100 largest public companies. The company, founded in 1940, reported full-year 2014 earnings of $1.45 billion. It beat analyst expectations with its Q2 earnings, logging $348.8 million in revenue and 20 cents in earnings per share over predictions of $347 million in revenue and 15 cents per share. \nWant Dallas Banking & Financial Services news in your inbox?
