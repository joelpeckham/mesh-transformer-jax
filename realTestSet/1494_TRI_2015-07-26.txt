The shutdown has put at risk the bourse's place in global securities indices. \nBanks reopened last Monday and Greece submitted a plan to the European Central Bank last week for an opinion before a decision was made by the Greek finance ministry which would allow the stock market to resume trading as early as Monday.The Athens Stock Exchange official said Greece needed more time to finalize the details which would allow the market to reopen based on ECB's opinion. \n(Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou; Editing by Angus MacSwan; Editing by Angus MacSwan)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was 32.08023452758789 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was ",
