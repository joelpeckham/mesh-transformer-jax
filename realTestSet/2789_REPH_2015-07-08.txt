(Nasdaq: REPH ), a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company developing multiple non-opioid therapeutics for the treatment of acute post operative pain, today announced that it has closed the private placement announced on July 1, 2015. \nPursuant to the securities purchase agreement with a group of institutional accredited investors led by Broadfin Capital, LLC, the Company issued 1,379,311 shares of common stock, providing the Company with gross proceeds of approximately $16 million. The purchase price for the common stock was $11.60 per share. \nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the financing to further fund the clinical development of Recro Pharma's lead candidates, IV/IM meloxicam and Dex-IN, in addition to general corporate purposes. \nJefferies LLC acted as lead placement agent and Brean Capital, LLC, Janney Montgomery Scott LLC and MLV & Co. acted as co-placement agents for the offering. \nAbout Recro Pharma, Inc. \nRecro Pharma is a revenue generating specialty pharmaceutical company developing multiple non-opioid therapeutics for the treatment of acute post operative pain. Recro Pharma is currently developing IV/IM meloxicam, a proprietary, Phase III-ready, long-acting preferential COX-2 inhibitor, and Dex-IN, a proprietary intranasal formulation of dexmedetomidine currently being tested in Phase II, for the treatment of acute post operative pain. As Recro Pharma's product candidates are not in the opioid class of drugs, the Company believes its candidates would avoid many of the side effects associated with commonly prescribed opioid therapeutics, such as addiction, constipation and respiratory distress, while maintaining analgesic effect. \nRecro Pharma also owns and operates an 87,000 square foot, DEA-licensed facility that manufactures five commercial products and receives royalties associated with the sales of these products. \nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements \nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
