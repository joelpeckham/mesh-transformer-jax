The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFont size Email Print \nWeb giant Amazon could take the top spot for US apparel retailing by 2017, analysts have predicted, displacing current leader Macy's. \nAccording to Cowen & Co analysts, Amazon's surge to the top will be down to its apparel business benefiting from &quotbetter selection, rising brand relationships and superior fulfilment&quot. \n&quotAmzon's US apparel and accessories business will displace Macy's as the number one US apparel retailer by 2017, in our view, driven by accelerating purchaser growth due to more selection, rising 1P brand relationships and the best fulfilment.\" \nAccording to Cowen, Amazon has around 19m apparel-related SKUs, and its US apparel purchaser growth is up 36% year-on-year in the first half of 2015, versus 28% last year. This is faster than electronics and general merchandise purchaser growth overall for the group. \n&quotWe estimate the US apparel business will grow from $16bn gross merchandise value (GMV) in 2015 to $52bn in 2020,\" the analysts predict. &quotThis implies a gain in US apparel and accessories market share from 5% to 14%.\" \nThis apparel growth for Amazon, Cowen believes, will likely contribute to further consolidation, M&A, and physical store closures. \n&quotWe see non-differentiated retailers at greatest risk, with longer-term risks to department stores and broadlines.\" \nKey risks to traditional retail, they say, include: greater price transparency driving merchandise margin pressure, conflicting vendor/supplier relationships, Amazon\u2019s distribution/speed brawn versus traditional retail, and Amazon\u2019s customer loyalty/checkout. \nLong-term winners, Cowen says, will be brand owners with the most innovative product and category leadership, and retailers leveraging bricks 'n clicks. \nIn particular, while the analysts expect Nike, Under Armour, and other global brands to benefit from Amazon's apparel growth, the analysts believe PVH Corp in particular has the highest exposure to the web giant with over 6,000 listings through first-party relationships for CK and Hilfiger. \n&quotPVH sells directly to Amazon on a wholesale basis in the US and Europe with its CK and Tommy brands. Of critical importance to PVH is protecting its brand image and management strictly oversees pricing, promotions and product that appear on Amazon and other e-tailing partners.\" \nPVH has been busy growing its partnership with Amazon and they collaborate on promotional events to avoid unplanned discounting.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Amazon.com, Inc. was 488.1000061035156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Amazon.com, Inc. was ",
