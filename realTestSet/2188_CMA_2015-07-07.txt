The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n19.005 -0.235 \nCentrica (LSE: CNA.L - news ) chief executive Iain Conn says CMA claim that households have been paying \u00a31.2bn a year too much for energy \"doesn't stack up\" \nThe Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s analysis that the Big Six suppliers have charged households \u00a350 a year too much for their energy is \u201cnot credible\u201d, British Gas owner Centrica has claimed. \nIain Conn, Centrica chief executive, on Tuesday broadly welcomed the CMA report into the energy sector, but he said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the CMA\u2019s claims that household customers had been paying \u00a31.2bn a year and SME customers \u00a3500m a year more than they would have been \u201chad competition functioned more effectively\u201d. \nMr Conn said: \u201cIf you take 2012 and 2013 for sure, the total amount of profit all the big energy suppliers made added together was \u00a31.6bn. So the implication the CMA seem to be saying in this piece of economic theory is that we should all be happy doing this for nothing, which I just don\u2019t think is credible. \n\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I want to challenge. It doesn\u2019t stack up... \u00a350 a family is the total profit we make.\u201d \nHe acknowledged that British Gas could however be more cost efficient in a more competitive market. \nMr Conn said the CMA\u2019s proposed temporary price caps on default tariffs were a \u201cperfectly feasible idea\u201d although he had questions about how it would work. \nAnalysts at Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) said the plan was \u201clikely to be seen as negative by investors\u201d while UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) said the proposal was \u201cpotentially harmful to gas retailers\u201d. \nMr Conn said: \u201cDepending where it is set and how it is set, it could have an impact on our margins for our standard variable customers, but let\u2019s wait and see.\" \nHe said other proposals put forward by the CMA, such as lifting a cap on the number of tariffs they could offer, may be \u201coffsetting factors that mean it does not materially impact the profitability\u201d. \nOther suppliers also broadly welcomed the CMA's report. RWE (Xetra: 703712 - news ) and ScottishPower both said the CMA report served to \u201cdispel myths\u201d about the energy market.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Comerica Incorporated was 41.55442428588867 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Comerica Incorporated was ",
