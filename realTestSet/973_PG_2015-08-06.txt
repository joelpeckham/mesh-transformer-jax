 "context": "The following article called 'P&G wipes out rival Kimberly-Clark in ad dispute' was published on 2015-08-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCourtesy of P&G Kimberly-Clark had advertised that its Huggies Natural Care Wipes \u201cclean better\u201d than\u2026 more Procter & Gamble Co. prevailed in a complaint filed against competitor Kimberly-Clark Corp. over a TV commercial and other ads for baby wipes. Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) had advertised that its Huggies Natural Care Wipes \u201cclean better\u201d than Pampers Sensitive Wipes, but P&G (NYSE: PG) challenged the claim before the National Advertising Division of the Council for Better Business Bureaus. The NAD, which is designed to settle disputes over ads while avoiding the expense of lawsuits, reported this week that it had recommended Kimberly-Clark stop making the claim on its television commercial, website advertising and email marketing. Kimberly-Clark said the ads were fair because a disclaimer noted the claim was based on a consumer home-use test of the Huggies and Pampers products. Irving, Texas-based based Kimberly Clark followed up by asking customers which brand they preferred. Cincinnati-based P&G argued that the test was flawed and unreliable because participants weren\u2019t polled by Kimberly-Clark until after the 14-day period in which the wipes were used, which allowed for lapses in recalling which product was best. In addition, the test could have been biased because Kimberly-Clark covered up brand labels with tape instead of removing the wipes from the distinctive original packaging, P&G said. Following the test, 77 respondents preferred Huggies, 52 preferred Pampers and 51 replied \u201cneither/don\u2019t know.\u201d P&G conducted its own testing and concluded the products \u201chave no meaningful difference in cleaning performance,\u201d the NAD reported. However, P&G said its technical testing showed that Pampers Sensitive Wipes were stronger and more flexible than Huggies Natural Care wipes, which P&G claimed were characteristics relevant to cleaning performance. P&G and Kimberly-Clark have had a series of disputes that focused on whether an advertising claim was supported by objective testing rather than based on the perceptions of consumers, the NAD said. In each case, Kimberly-Clark argued its advertising claims were best assessed by consumers who regularly used the products. Kimberly-Clark said each ad was supported by home-use studies and consumer questionnaires, but P&G said such claims couldn\u2019t be proven. In the baby wipes dispute, the NAD determined that Kimberly-Clark\u2019s advertising claim \u201cshould be substantiated with objective testing that goes beyond simply asking consumers for their opinions as to which product cleans better.\u201d The \u201ccleaning ability of a baby wipe can be objectively measured because its performance can be tied directly to a specific tangible benefit \u2013 the removal of mess from a child,\u201d but Kimberly-Clark didn\u2019t submit test results that might prove its claim, the NAD reported. Kimberly-Clark responded that it \u201ccontinues to believe that cleaning efficacy is a product attribute that can be appropriately supported with consumer-use data.\u201d However, \u201cin the interest of industry self-regulation, current and future advertising materials will take the NAD\u2019s recommendation into account,\u201d Kimberly-Clark stated. The TV commercial that included the \u201ccleans better\u201d claim is no longer being used, Kimberly-Clark added. \nWant Cincinnati Manufacturing news in your inbox?
