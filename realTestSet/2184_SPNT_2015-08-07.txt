The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCompany : Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Friday, August 7, 2015 3:25PM IST (9:55AM GMT) Taro Provides Results for Quarter Ended June 2015 Hawthorne, N.Y., United States Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE:TARO) (\u201cTaro\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) provided unaudited financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Quarter ended June 30, 2015 Highlights - compared to June 30, 2014 Net sales of $215 million, reflects an increase of $85 million. Last year\u2019s quarter net sales were negatively impacted by a $79 million provision for price protection (current quarter\u2019s price protection provision was $14 million). On a pro-forma basis, adjusted for the price protection provisions, the net sales increase would have been 10%. Sales volumes declined 10% as the result of an increase in competitor activity in the U.S. market. Gross profit was $172 million as compared to $85 million. Excluding the impact of the aforementioned price adjustments in both periods, the gross profit increase would have been 13% over the same period last year. Research and development (R&D) and Selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat. Operating income increased $80 million to $134 million, primarily due to the benefits realized from the price adjustments in the prior year. Excluding the non-recurring items, operating income on a comparable basis, would have increased approximately 17%. Net income attributable to Taro was $104 million compared to $46 million, a $58 million increase, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $2.42 compared to $1.08. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Highlights Cash flow provided by operations was $68 million compared to $36 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Cash, including short-term bank deposits and marketable securities, increased $77 million to $998 million from March 31, 2015.
