Swisscom's Italian broadband unit Fastweb is seeking damages of 1.74 billion euros, Internet firm Tiscali (Milan: TIS.MI - news ) is seeking 285 million, while small telecoms firms Eutelia, Voiceplus and Teleunit are demanding a combined sum of nearly 1.1 billion. \nA third source with knowledge of the matter said a deal in at least one of those cases could be within reach. \nA settlement, if reached, would allow the parties to bypass lengthy judicial proceedings. \nTelecom Italia is expected to set aside at least 300 million euros to cover risks connected to the lawsuits when it approves its results this week. \nIn 2013, Italy's competition authority fined Telecom Italia about 104 million euros for abusing its dominant market position as owner and manager of the country's largest fixed-line phone network. The fine was upheld by Italy's top court in May.
