Mediobanca said the purchase would help the Italian bank offer more services to its existing customers, as well as enable it to access Cairn\u2019s investor base. \nCairn Capital\u2019s chief executive Paul Campbell is staying at the firm and has been given a new, longer-term contract. \nRBS is keen to pull out of businesses like Cairn as it tries to return to sustainable profits . The Edinburgh-based bank was instrumental in establishing Cairn Capital back in 2004, when the asset management and advisory firm was set up by a group of investment bankers backed by RBS and Star Capital Partners. \nSince then, RBS has re-focused on retail and business banking, as the business is re-shaped in the wake of the financial crisis. \nA key landmark in that process was reached this week when the government sold its first stake in the bank , offloading shares amounting to 5.4pc of the bank in a \u00a32.1bn sale. \n\u201cThis transaction confirms our strategic focus on building a leading asset management business with attractive earnings and high return on capital to further develop the international footprint of Mediobanca,\u201d said Alberto Nagel, CEO of Mediobanca. \n\u201cCairn Capital is an excellent company with an outstanding management team and will be a highly complementary fit with Mediobanca's alternative asset management platform. We view credit as a very appealing asset class and see multiple synergies across the two organisations, including our corporate and investment banking business. Cairn Capital\u2019s expertise across the entire credit spectrum will enable us to offer our clients valuable long-term advice and investment products.\u201d \nThe acquisition came as Mediobanca announced its revenues increased by 12pc in the financial year ending in June, coming in at over \u20ac2bn for the first time ever. Its profits rose 27pc on the year to \u20ac590m, allowing the bank to increase its dividend by 67pc to \u20ac0.25 per share.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was 2250.0 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Orbsat Corp. was ",
