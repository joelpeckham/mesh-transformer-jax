The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n  22 October 2015 11:06 CET Get Woyome's money before I pay my tax; defaulting tax payer tells GRA taskforce By Luv Fm | Prince Appiah \nThere was drama at the Suame Magazine in Kumasi when the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) embarked a distress action on tax defaulting businesses. \nOwner of Doreenas Enterprise, a spare parts dealer, engaged in a verbal confrontation with the revenue mobilization taskforce over her tax obligation. \nAfia Abrafi is reported to have forcibly opened her shop when the taskforce locked it in an earlier operation a month ago. \nAccording to GRA officials, she owes about 168,500 Ghana Cedis in taxes between 2008 and 2013. \nThe woman initially denied the default amount to the revenue collection agency, and attempts by the taskforce to lock-up the shop again Wednesday ended in a confrontation. \n\u201cGo for Woyome\u2019s money first before you come asking me to pay any tax,\u201d she told the taskforce officials. Since the beginning of the GRA\u2019s operations in August, the taskforce will close down defaulting business then re-open when necessary payment is made.\nFor Abrafi, she needed a court order before she will allow this to happen. \u201cI need a court order before I allow you to close my shop,\u201d she declared, claiming she doesn\u2019t owe. \u201cI don\u2019t owe you, what did I buy from you that I owe?\u201d, she asked rhetorically. \nThe plump-size woman lay flat in her shop making it difficult for the taskforce to move her. \u201cYou can\u2019t take me away; I am not going anywhere, unless you kill me\u2019\u2019, she dared the taskforce. \u201cIf I owe you, take me to court, and I will bring my lawyers to defend me if you go to court.\u201d\nThe commotion drew many people to the scene but that wouldn\u2019t stop the taskforce from doing its work. \nAt a point, Auntie Afia, as she is affectionately called, said to one of the taskforce officials, \u201cI have seen your rank and name; I will serve all of you letters for embarrassing me like this\u201d. \nThis continued for about twenty minutes before the taskforce could manage to whisk her away in a vehicle to the Central Police Station. Coordinator of the Taskforce, Henry Sam, says the woman will be charged for impeding the tax administration.\n\u201cWe intend to put her before court and charge her for impeding administration in accordance with to the Internal Revenue Act,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cWithout recourse to the tax office, she forcibly opened the place and resumed normal business without satisfying the tax debt.\u201d \nWednesday\u2019s exercise was aimed at recovering over 131, 000 Ghana Cedis from recalcitrant tax defaulters. \nThe action is part of a revenue mobilization drive to retrieve a target of 120 million Ghana Cedis from across the country.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ConAgra Foods, Inc. was 27.203384399414062 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ConAgra Foods, Inc. was ",
