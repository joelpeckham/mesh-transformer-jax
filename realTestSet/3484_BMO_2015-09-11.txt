GE Capital, Transportation Finance provides wholesale and commercial end-user financing to OEMs, dealers and end users for heavy and medium duty commercial trucks and trailers. BMO will retain the Transportation Finance management team and employees.

With this transaction, the total for 2015 announced sales is approximately US$85 billion. Sherin concluded, \u201cWe expect to reach sales agreements for the majority of our U.S. businesses by the end of this year and the sale of our Transportation Finance business, one of our core commercial lending and leasing businesses, gets us closer to that goal.\u201d The transaction is subject to customary regulatory and other approvals and is expected to close in December of 2015.
