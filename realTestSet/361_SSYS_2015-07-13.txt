The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSee All Homes of the Day More than just a product issue though, the suit also alleges the defendants \u201cengaged in a fraudulent scheme to artificially inflate the company\u2019s stock price by both misrepresenting and concealing the true operational and conditions of the Company and its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary, MakerBot Industries, LLC (\u201cMakerBot\u201d).\u201d Leading up to the alleged scheme, Minnesota-based Stratasys (Nasdaq: SSYS) purchased Makerbot for $493.7 million in August 2013, at a time when the stock was worth about $90. Between then and January 3, the stock jumped 33 percent to its all-time high of $136. But between September 2014 and now, the stock dropped 73 percent \u2014 bottoming out at today\u2019s midday trading price of $34.49. In February, mid-way through that slide, Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP filed a class action lawsuit against Stratasys claiming that it mislead investors about details pertaining to the Makerbot acquisition, according to a 3D Print report . A month later Makerbot closed three retail shops and laid off 20 percent of its staff, or about 100 workers. During the struggles Stratasys seems committed to its investment in Makerbot. In June it announced plans to expand its subsidiary into Asian markets, including Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing and earlier this month it announced a deal that will put Makerbot machines in each of the more than 600 Sam's Clubs nation wide. The plaintiffs have demanded a trial by jury, though no date has been set. \nWant New York Manufacturing news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
