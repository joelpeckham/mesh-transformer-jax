Compared to the same month one year ago, the SBLI is up 19%. \u201cThe small business economy is leading the charge for growth within an overall economic environment of slow progress that has defined the current expansion,\u201d states William Phelan, president of PayNet. \u201cStrong financial health means small businesses will find easier access to credit and more of them will find borrowing needs met\u201d Phelan added.Small businesses kicked it up a notch last month: Businesses in Transportation (+25.7%), Construction (+13.8%) and Accommodation and Food Services (+15.6%) sectors showed the highest growth. Agriculture (-14.8%), Mining (-5.2%) and Wholesale (-1.2%) sectors lag the national trend. A recent PayNet study shows improved credit markets could boost GDP upwards toward 3%. The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Delinquency Index (SBDI) 31-90 days past due decreased 2 basis points from 1.24% in May 2015 to 1.22% in June 2015. As compared to one year ago, delinquency is flat; this is the first month since May 2014 that delinquency was not up year-over-year.States that were lagging during the recession have shown a big uptick in borrowing \u2013 Florida (+11.5%), Pennsylvania (+9.3%) and California (+8.8%). \u201cThis latest data release shows the private small business sector accelerating, which is a big positive as the U.S. economy evolves,\u201d Phelan added.
