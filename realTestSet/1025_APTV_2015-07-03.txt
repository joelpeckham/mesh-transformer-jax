Its Star fund exclusively invests in MIH projects and is achieving IRRs of over 30 per cent, the company said. Star fund has now been scaled up and opened to foreign investors with the launch of Star Fund II with a targeted AUM of Rs 1,500 crore, it said. \"Asha fund will be done in conjunction with DHFL and Aadhar Housing Finance, through which ArthVeda has access to a ground force of more than 5,000 personnel and relationship with 300 builders across 736 locations in India,\" Sen said, adding the expertise of the Group companies and a vast ground force will enable it to significantly reduce investment risks.
