The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nContent preferences Done \nSecond-quarter results from International Business Machines Corporation IBM came in after the market closed on Monday. While earnings looked impressive, revenues were underwhelming. This is in keeping with a theme that has developed over 12 consecutive quarters. Important lessons are emerging from this report which underlines prevailing trends in the technology domain. \nRevenue Numbers Disappoint \nThe going has been tough for many corporations in the technology arena especially for those with ties to hardware. Slowing demand for Personal Computers (PCs) has hurt sales and profits. IBM has also suffered on this count. The firm posted revenues of $20.81 billion, compared to the revenue estimate of $21.02 billion. \nHowever, the tech giant did manage to beat on earnings. The company posted EPS of $3.84, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.80. Weakness on the revenue front is possibly a result of the growing importance of cloud computing, cybersecurity and big data. It is not that IBM hasn\u2019t launched initiatives in that direction. Cloud Revenue was up more than 70% adjusting for currency and divested businesses. However, IBM seems to have come in too late into this arena. \nMicrosoft\u2019s Triumph \nMeanwhile, Microsoft Corporation MSFT is successfully transforming into a company built around a model focusing on mobile and cloud technology. It has been particularly successful in the cloud computing arena with its Azure platform. Microsoft also offers a hybrid cloud solution that enables the integration of existing IT infrastructure with the public cloud. \nOn the other hand, it has taken concrete steps to grow in the mobile arena. Its Surface tablet is poised to push sales further upward. Meanwhile, market watchers are focused on the launch of Windows 10. Microsoft\u2019s promise of a free upgrade will ensure that there is less of a slowdown as everyone gets get ready for the new OS. \nOur Choices \nThe tale of these two companies illustrates the importance of cloud computing, cybersecurity and big data.
