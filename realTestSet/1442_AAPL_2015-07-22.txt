The California company revealed it sold 47.5m iPhones in the third quarter, up 35% on the same period last year but short of analysts' expectations of 48.8m. IPad sales fell 18% to 10.9m, the sixth consecutive quarter of declines. \nApple guided towards revenues of between $49bn and $51bn in its fourth quarter, shy of the $51.1bn consensus forecast.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 29.835147857666016 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
