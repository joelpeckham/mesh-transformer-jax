The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n  Profitability of banks does not only depend on what interest rates they charge on loans, but more importantly, on how much they pay their depositors. The competitiveness of any bank depends on how low it is able to keep cost of funds. The most important component of this is the so-called CASA, where CA stands for current account and SA, for savings account. These deposits are called low-cost since banks do not pay any interest on current account deposits. On savings accounts, most banks barring Yes Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank pay 4% interest. A recent study by Nomura shows that state-run banks are not only plagued by bad loans, but also sliding CASA. Current accounts have grown at a slower pace with depositors reluctant to park surplus funds. In savings account, individuals have contributed the most with 77% share followed by SME and trusts. A report by Nomura says CASA growth has moderated from 20% on CAGR in fiscal 2008. Although savings account growth is keeping pace with overall deposit expansion at 14% CAGR, the current account growth continues to dip. Changes in incremental current account and savings account share are the most notable. Over the past two years, private banks accounted for 60% of incremental current account deposits with just 20% of total deposit share. The incremental savings account share of private banks increased to 28% in FY13-15 versus 24% in FY11-13.  \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Nomura Holdings Inc was 4.82230806350708 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Nomura Holdings Inc was ",
