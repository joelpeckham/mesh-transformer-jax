The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBy Reuters Thursday, 30 July 2015 7:28 PM \nSaudi Arabia's Etihad Etisalat (Mobily) restated results for the last 27 months on Thursday, slashing total profits over the period by nearly 1.76 billion riyals ($470 million) in its latest attempt to resolve an accounting scandal. \nThe telecom operator, whose largest shareholder is Abu Dhabi-listed Etisalat, shocked investors in November when it first restated some earnings - for 2013 and the first half of 2014 - which it blamed on accounting errors. \nMobily has now made further adjustments in response to a regulatory probe into its accounts, according to a Riyadh bourse filing, cutting its net profit in 2013 to nearly 4.69 billion riyals from 5.94 billion riyals. \nMobily also increased its loss in 2014 to 1.58 billion riyals from 913 million riyals, although its first-quarter loss in 2015 has been reduced to 45 million riyals from a previously reported 199 million riyals. \nMobily had attributed its woes to the premature booking of revenue from wholesale broadband leases and mobile promotional campaigns and it has now also made further changes to the way it accounts for some contracts and the depreciation of property and equipment. \nMobily's shares have been suspended since June pending its response to a regulator investigation. The stock is down 58 percent since the accounting scandal broke, wiping about $9.4 billion off the company's value. \nMobily's losses also put it in breach of loan covenants and it remains in talks with lenders to agree new terms on its outstanding borrowings. \nIn May the Capital Market Authority referred a case of suspected insider trading at Mobily to public prosecutors, stating more than one person was a suspect. \nMobily's shares fell 8 percent in the three trading sessions prior to its shock November announcement. \nThe company is due to reveal its second-quarter earnings on Sunday. \nParent firm Etisalat, which on Tuesday reported a 40 percent drop in its second-quarter profit that it partly blamed on Mobily, earlier this year decided to recognise its share of results from its Saudi affiliate with a lag of one quarter.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was 33.489505767822266 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was ",
