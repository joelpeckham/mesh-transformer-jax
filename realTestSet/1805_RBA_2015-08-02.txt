RBA likely to keep rates on hold AAP \u2013 2 hours 54 minutes ago Recommend Print \nIn a busy week for economic figures and events one thing seems clear - the Reserve Bank won't moving interest rates. \nThe central bank will hold its monthly board meeting on Tuesday amid a wealth of new data, including house prices, job advertisements, retail sales, international trade and the crucial monthly employment numbers. \nAcademics doubt there is a need to change the cash rate from its record low setting of two per cent at this stage, where it has stood since May. \nAustralian National University's Timo Henckel said there has been little new domestic economic data in the past month to force a change by the RBA aside from official inflation figures that showed the annual rate at just 1.5 per cent, well below the two to three per cent target band. \nAt the same time, the Greek debt crisis has been averted but China's stock market remains vulnerable to further declines. \n\"The uncertainties surrounding the Chinese economy pose the biggest immediate threat to Australia's export markets and thus to Australia's GDP,\" Dr Henckel said. \nDr Henckel chairs the ANU's so-called \"RBA shadow board\" made up of academics, economists and former RBA board members. \nThe group tries to gauge what decision RBA governor Glenn Stevens and his team might make on interest rates every month. \nFor August, the group gave a near-70 per cent probability of an unchanged two per cent cash rate. \nThe RBA will also release its quarterly monetary policy statement on Friday, which will include its latest inflation and economic growth forecasts. @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Melbourne Port lease to reap $200m AAP \nSelling the Port of Melbourne lease will provide $200 million to help Victorian farmers with investment in agricultural \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ritchie Bros.
