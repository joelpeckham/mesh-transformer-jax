The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTue, Jul 21, 2015, 7:45 AM AEST - Australia Markets open in 2 hrs 15 mins $A lower ahead of RBA minutes release AAP \u2013 17 minutes ago Print \nThe Australian dollar is lower against the greenback as traders look ahead to the release of minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's July meeting. \nAt 0700 AEST on Tuesday, the local currency was trading at 73.71 US cents, down from 73.90 cents on Monday. \nBK Asset Management managing director Kathy Lien said the release of the RBA's monthly minutes was a key event for the local currency on Tuesday. \n\"Given that the RBA met during the meltdown in Chinese equities, the tone of the monetary policy statement will most likely reflect their concern about the possibility of further weakness in stocks and its implications for China's economy,\" Ms Lien said. \n\"So, while the Australian dollar/US dollar bounced intraday, dovish minutes will send the currency pair to fresh multi-year lows.\" \nWestpac strategist Imre Speizer tipped the Aussie to stabilise around 73.25 US cents on Tuesday, as long as there was no surprise from the RBA. \nHe said the \"eventual resumption of the strong US dollar trend should weigh on the Australian dollar during the next few months\", forecasting 73.25 US cents as the next major downside target. \nCURRENCY SNAPSHOT AT 0700 AEST ON TUESDAY \nOne Australian dollar buys: \n* 73.71 US cents, from 73.90 cents on Monday \n* 91.57 Japanese yen, from 91.73 yen \n* 68.09 euro cents, from 68.17 euro cents \n* 112.23 New Zealand cents, from 112.08 NZ cents \n* 47.36 British pence, from 47.33 pence \n(*Currency closes taken at 1700 AEST previous local session) @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ritchie Bros.
