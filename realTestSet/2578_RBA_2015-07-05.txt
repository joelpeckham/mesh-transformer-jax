The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nView Photo \n\nAcademics doubt the unfolding events in Greece will result in lower interest rates when the Reserve Bank board meets on Tuesday. \nBut governor Glenn Stevens will no doubt be keeping a wary eye on the global financial market reaction to Sunday's Greek referendum. \nGreeks will vote in a referendum to decide whether their country agrees to more stringent austerity measures after it defaulted on an International Monetary Fund loan of 1.5 billion euros ($A2.18 billion) last week. \nThe outcome hangs in the balance, but Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has pursued a `no' vote. \nAustralian National University's Timo Henckel says Australia's direct exposure to the Greek economy is minimal. \n\"(But) a complete breakdown of negotiations between Greece and the European Union, followed by a Greek exit from the euro, may have noticeable ramifications for global financial markets,\" he said. \nDr Henckel chairs the ANU's so-called \"RBA shadow board\" made up of academics, economists and former RBA board members. The group tries to gauge what decision Mr Stevens and his team might make on interest rates every month. \nIt expects the cash rate to remain at a record low of two per cent on Tuesday. \nAbbott government frontbencher Scott Morrison says events in Greece are a warning of what can happen if you don't get your house in order. He noted Greece's debt didn't get to 100 per cent of GDP overnight, rather it was through unsustainable polices. \nHe said Greece had been aware of its financial problems surrounding an ageing population since the 1980s, and while it had undertaken significant reforms in recent years he believed it was too little, too late. \nIt is a \"distant\" warning for Australians, the social services minister told Network Ten on Sunday. \n\"We're seeing pictures of pensioners today in Greece crying, sitting on the streets, just in absolute despair. Well, I don't want to see that happen to future pensioners in Australia.\" \nThat is why the Australian government is seeking to raise the pension age to 70 in 2035 to ensure the pension is there in the future. \nFormer NSW Labor treasurer Michael Costa says drawing analogies between Greece and Australia is \"overblown\". He described the Greek ballot as \"dishonest\". \n\"The top of the ballot paper has `no' and the bottom has `yes',\" he told Network Ten. \"In between is text that is indecipherable and badly translated. It's a stitch-up.\" \nHe said Greece needed more, not less austerity in terms of structural reform.  \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ritchie Bros.
