The two-track approach is required as it is not feasible to roll out CO2-based air conditioning technology across the fleet by January 2017, Daimler said. \nThe Commission was not immediately available for comment. \n(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Christoph Steitz and David Evans)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 29.137985229492188 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
