The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWed, Aug 5, 2015, 12:13 AM AEST - Australia Markets open in 9 hrs 47 mins Sprott Resource Corp. Announces Agreement for $200 Million Private Placement by Long Run Exploration Ltd. NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWS SERVICES OR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES Press Release : Sprott Resource Corp. \u2013 2 hours 13 minutes ago Recommend 0.75 -0.01 TORONTO, Aug. 4, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sprott Resource Corp. (\"SRC\" or the \"Company\") ( SCP.TO ) announced today that Long Run Exploration Ltd. (\"Long Run\"), in which SRC holds a 11.9% equity interest, has entered into an agreement for a private placement of Long Run common shares to Maple Marathon Investments Limited (\"Maple Marathon\") for gross proceeds of approximately $200 million (the \"Private Placement\"). Maple Marathon is owned by MIE Holdings Corporation (\"MIE\"), an independent oil and gas exploration company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (the \"HKSe\"). The proceeds from the Private Placement will be used for debt reduction to improve Long Run's capital structure. \nLong Run, Maple Marathon and MIE have entered into an investment agreement (the \"Investment Agreement\") pursuant to which Long Run will issue to Maple Marathon 155,000,000 units (\"Units\") at an issue price of $1.30 per Unit. Each Unit will consist of: (i) one common share of Long Run; (ii) one-fifth of a common share purchase warrant expiring 18 months following closing of the Private Placement (each such whole warrant, an \"18 Month Warrant\"); and (iii) one-fifth of a common share purchase warrant expiring 24 months following closing of the Private Placement (each such whole warrant, a \"24 Month Warrant\"). Each 18 Month Warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one common share of Long Run at an exercise price of $1.40 for a period of 18 months from closing of the Private Placement. Each 24 Month Warrant will entitle the holder to acquire one common share of Long Run at an exercise price of $1.80 for a period of 24 months from closing of the Private Placement. \nAfter giving effect to the Private Placement, Maple Marathon will hold approximately 43.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Long Run (prior to giving effect to any exercise of the warrants). \nThe closing of the Private Placement is subject to various conditions, including approval by a majority of the shareholders of Long Run, approval of the shareholders of MIE and the receipt of required regulatory approvals (including approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the \"TSX\") and approvals required under the Investment Canada Act and the Competition Act (Canada)). The closing of the Private Placement is also conditional on Maple Marathon securing financing to fund its subscription for the Units. \nAs Maple Marathon will acquire more than 20% of the outstanding common shares of Long Run, the TSX rules require that the Private Placement be approved by the shareholders of Long Run at a special meeting to be called for such purpose (the \"Long Run Special Meeting\"). In addition, pursuant to the rules of the HKSe, the Private Placement will require approval of the shareholders of MIE at a meeting of shareholders of MIE to be called for such purpose. \nCompletion of the Private Placement is expected to occur following the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals and is currently expected to occur in late November 2015. \nSRC has agreed to vote its common shares in favour of the Private Placement at the Long Run Special Meeting, as have certain directors, officers and other shareholders of Long Run who hold approximately 11% of the outstanding common shares (on a non-diluted basis). The principal shareholder of MIE, holding in the aggregate approximately 54% of the issued and outstanding common shares of MIE (on a non-diluted basis), has agreed to vote in favour of the Private Placement at the MIE meeting of shareholders to be held to consider the Private Placement. \nForward-Looking Statements \nCertain statements in this press release contain forward-looking information (collectively referred to herein as the \"Forward-Looking Statements\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The use of any of the words \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", \"should\", \"believe\", \"plans\", \"intends\" and similar expressions are intended to identify Forward-Looking Statements. In particular, but without limiting the foregoing, this press release contains Forward-Looking Statements pertaining to the anticipated timing of closing of the Private Placement and the use of proceeds from the Private Placement.
