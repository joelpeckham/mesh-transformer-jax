 "context": "The following article called 'Q&A: Lloyds retail shares offer' was published on 2015-10-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRead more \nLloyds stopped paying out dividends during the financial crisis but has recently begun paying them again, and analysts expect it to yield 3.5 per cent this year, rising to 5 per cent next year. Last year investors had to be on the share register by April 2 to qualify for the dividend. What are the reasons for saying \u2018no thanks\u2019? \nAs with any share purchase, the value may go down as well as up, while valuing banks is problematic. Gary Greenwood, banking analyst at Liverpool-based stockbroker Shore Capital, said: \u201cYou have general economic uncertainties and broader regulatory uncertainties, so even institutional investors find it hard to get their heads around valuing banks.\u201d \nLloyds\u2019 biggest area of lending is mortgages, Mr Greenwood said, making the bank heavily exposed to UK property market. Bad debt charges on Lloyds\u2019 loan book are currently worth just 0.11 per cent of its risk-weighted assets. \nThat means very few of its customers are failing to repay loans, which is unsurprising given that Bank of England base rates have been low since 2009, but also improves the bank\u2019s profitability because bad debt charges cost lenders money. \nMr Greenwood cautions against buying into a lender when market conditions are so sunny, because \u201cif there is a housing market deterioration or interest rates do rise, you would expect the bad debt charges to increase\u201d. \nAnother dark cloud over Lloyds\u2019 earnings is that the Bank of England is moving closer to forcing banks to set more of their capital aside to protect them in an economic downturn, instead of lending the money out \u2014 a potential drag on profits. Is it a good idea to buy these shares now in the hope that the planned retail offer will give them a \u2018pop\u2019 later on? \nThis is uncertain, and the price of the shares could even fall slightly after the sale, if some traders engage in what is known as \u201cstagging\u201d \u2014 buying shares in a flotation at the offer price and selling them as soon as they rise. \nThe Treasury is trying to limit stagging by offering a loyalty bonus of one share for every ten held to people who keep them for more than a year. But the bonus is capped at \u00a3200, a sum unlikely to sway market professionals who choose to stag. \nThe share offer will not dilute the holdings of existing shareholders, who have had a tough summer amid market volatility: the shares were down 7 per cent in August and fractionally more in September. What is the government\u2019s history of running asset sales? What could go wrong? \nThe Coalition government was heavily criticised for underpricing the sale of shares in Royal Mail in 2014. Lazard\u2019s asset management arm made an \u00a38m profit from \u201cstagging\u201d the stock, even as its investment bank advised the government on the sale. However, the Lloyds sale cannot be fundamentally mispriced as the stock already has a market value and the government has committed to that 5 per cent discount. How do I register my interest in buying shares? \nThe government has set up a website for private investors to register their interest in buying shares \u2014 you simply need to enter your email address. Are the shares eligible for tax-efficient wrappers? \nThe government has not yet said by what mechanism it will sell the shares, though when it sold shares in Royal Mail, investors were able to buy them through online platforms such as Hargreaves Lansdown and Barclays Stockbrokers, and use tax-efficient wrappers such as individual savings accounts (Isas). \nThis article has been amended to clarify Lazard\u2019s role in the Royal Mail sale.
