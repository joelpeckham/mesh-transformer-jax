The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThis big Apple move might strike fear into advertisers \u203a \nBen Williams, Adblock Plus communications and operations director, admitted its service didn't block in-app ads as well as those seen on browser windows. One reason: Blocking ads in apps would force its company to breach consumer privacy. \nPerhaps more important is that consumers seem to not want to block ads in-app, Williams said. He believes because consumers use apps with a specific purpose in mind, and are willing to pay for that function whether it's accepting the ad model or paying to remove ads. \n\"The app function employs a single [action], whereas the browser is seen as a multitool device,\" he said. \nFacebook also points out that it gives users more access to controlling their ad experience, including which information is used for ads. \n\" Ad blockers are generally not as effective because they attempt to block entire types of content and can interfere with functionality that people want to receive,\" the spokesperson said. \"We believe that control and transparency are the best way to empower people to control their information and their experience.\" \nHowever, Cunningham said having brands flock to apps for advertising may not be the solution to ad blocking. \n\"It's a little too soon to tell who wins,\" he said. \"Apps offer the opportunity to continue to put out nice advertising and experiences, and so far our research tells us that can continue on. Will we move to an apps-only consumption? Only time can tell.\" \nNo one disputes that ad blockers threaten an independent Internet, and the economic opportunities that digital media can provide for publishers, Cunningham said. It hurts small publishers who can't afford not to sell ads and still create editorial content, he added. \nAnd, apps may not be safe forever. Adkisson said some ad-blocking software companies are trying to work with mobile carriers to block all ads. Any function that relies on mobile data, including apps, won't be immune. As user demand for ad blockers increases, he thinks some carriers maybe tempted to offer these services. \n\"While you haven't seen those companies push back against ad blocking on the net yet, I think they are going to have to,\" Adkisson said.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 25.773225784301758 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
