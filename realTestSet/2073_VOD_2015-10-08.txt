It was held liable for capital gains tax which authorities say is owed on the deal. \nA dispute over a capital gains tax demand worth more than $2 billion related to that deal has yet to be resolved. \nVodafone's treatment, seen by many investors as heavy-handed, had fuelled debate over India's unpredictable rules and regulations. \nThe Bombay High Court had separately ruled in favour of the group last year in a transfer pricing tax dispute. In that case, India's tax office had accused Vodafone India Services Pvt Ltd of under-pricing shares in a rights issue to its parent, and had demanded tax of about 30 billion rupees. \nThe government, seeking to clean up a reputation for \"tax terrorism\", decided to not appeal that case. \nTransfer pricing is the value at which firms trade products, services or assets between units across borders, a regular part of doing business for a multinational. \nSeveral other multinationals including IBM Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) and Nokia Oyj are also fighting transfer-pricing cases in India. \nVodafone said in a statement that it welcomed the latest court ruling. It did not comment further.
