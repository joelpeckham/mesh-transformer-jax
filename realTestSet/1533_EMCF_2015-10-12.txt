It will crystallise Dell's radical transformation from what was once the world's biggest PC manufacturer into an IT (Other OTC: ITGL - news ) services company focused on selling to businesses. \nMr Dell and his private equity backers Silver Lake Partners took Dell private two years ago , as the PC industry was falling into decline, and promised to turn it into a leaner IT company with higher profit margins. \nSince then, the PC slump has worsened , with sales now down more than 25pc down on their peak, but Dell still makes just over half its money from computers. To buy EMC, it is reportedly having to arrange around $40bn in debt financing. \nThe deal is reported to be a complicated transaction, with EMC investors receiving $27 a share as well as a \"floating\" share that represents the public value of VMware, a desktop virtualisation software maker that EMC owns 81pc of. This would value the deal at around $53bn. \nEMC, based in Massachusetts, is the world's largest seller of data storage systems, as well as providing cloud computing and security to businesses. \nIts investors will have to approve a deal, and as such the takeover could face some hurdles. Activist investor Elliott Management has urged EMC to sell off VMware and said it is disappointed at current performance, while investors may also ask if other bidders might drive up the price. \nBecause of this, the deal will involve a 60-day \"go shop\" period after being agreed in which EMC is able to solicit itself elsewhere, according to reports . \nMr Dell founded the company that bears his name in his university dorm in 1984. Its custom-made designs helped it become the biggest PC manufacturer in the early 2000s , but cheap competition from Lenovo and the rise of HP set it back. \nWith the entire PC market seeing sales fall, it went private for $24bn in 2013, enabling it to turn around without pressure from public shareholders (Other OTC: UBGXF - news ) .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Emclaire Financial Corp was 18.246835708618164 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Emclaire Financial Corp was ",
