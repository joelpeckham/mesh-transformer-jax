In this way I do believe that we can be the development catalyst that we aspire to be,\u201d he said.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of AngloGold Ashanti Limited was 8.582911491394043 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of AngloGold Ashanti Limited was ",
