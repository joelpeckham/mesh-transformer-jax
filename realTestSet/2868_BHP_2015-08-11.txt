It would assist us and the people of South Australia if they were to be as open as they possibly can be,\" Mr Weatherill told reporters on Tuesday. \n\"I think people are becoming frustrated in seeking to understand where BHP stands, what their level of commitment is to South Australia. \n\"You don't need to guarantee anything.
