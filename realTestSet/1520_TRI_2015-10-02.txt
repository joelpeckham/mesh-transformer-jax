The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEight Brazilian ministers axed in Dilma Rousseff reshuffle Joe Leahy in S\u00e3o Paulo and Madison Marriage in London \u00a9Reuters \nPresident Dilma Rousseff of Brazil axed eight of her 39 ministers on Friday, and redistributed the remaining posts among her coalition allies, to head off an impeachment movement. \nThe reshuffle came as one of the president\u2019s fiercest critics, Eduardo Cunha , the house Speaker, was facing increasing pressure after Swiss authorities opened criminal proceedings against him for alleged money laundering and corruption. More Colombia to sign peace deal with rebels \n\u201cThis measure is to recover economic stability and meet the targets of our fiscal adjustment,\u201d said Ms Rousseff. \nThe development follows a market sell-off of Brazil\u2019s currency, the real, on doubts over whether the left-leaning president and her Workers\u2019 party, the PT, would be able to restore sinking public finances. \nMs Rousseff has flip-flopped on promises to reduce the growing budget deficit, which at 9.2 per cent of gross domestic product is undermining confidence and helping to deepen the recession. \nShe has also faced a rebellion in her main coalition partner, the PMDB, a loose grouping of regionalist politicians, who have signalled support for impeachment if the increasingly unpopular president does not share more power. \n\u201cShoring up in a lasting way the relationship with the PMDB will prove quite difficult, given that the party has already announced its intention to field its own presidential candidate in 2018,\u201d Goldman Sachs said in a report. \nMs Rousseff had been expected to axe 10 ministries on Friday. Instead, she cut eight, as well as reducing ministers\u2019 salaries by 10 per cent. \nShe also announced a rationalisation of the senior bureaucracy, cutting 30 secretaries and 3,000 jobs. \nAmong the most important ministerial changes, Ms Rousseff replaced her chief of staff, Aloizio Mercadante, with her defence minister, Jaques Wagner. This measure is to recover economic stability and meet the targets of our fiscal adjustment \n- Dilma Rousseff \nWhile Mr Mercadante, seen by analysts as a divisive figure, will remain as education minister, his removal from the key political co-ordinator post is expected to help smooth Ms Rousseff\u2019s relations within the cabinet and with an estranged congress. \nAnalysts said the new cabinet was a hybrid of appointees favoured by Ms Rousseff\u2019s predecessor and mentor, the former PT president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and of the PMDB. \n\u201cThe face of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has returned to command the presidential palace while the Esplanade [the Esplanade of Ministries, an avenue in Bras\u00edlia] was sold in one swoop to the PMDB,\u201d said Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. \nIt was not clear, however, for how long the reshuffle would head off the impeachment movement. \nThe government\u2019s chief opponent in the house, Mr Cunha, was struck a serious blow this week when Swiss authorities froze secret accounts he and his family allegedly kept in Switzerland. \nMr Cunha has already been implicated by Brazilian authorities in a big corruption scandal afflicting Petrobras, in which he is alleged to have received bribes from the state-owned oil company\u2019s contractors. He has denied the charges. \n\u201cSince Eduardo Cunha is a Brazilian, citizen he cannot be extradited to Switzerland,\u201d the Office of the Attorney-general of Switzerland said in a statement. For this reason, it was \u201ctransferring the ongoing proceedings against Cunha to Brazil with the aim that the issue at stake can be further investigated and judged by the Brazilian judicial authorities\u201d. \nMr Cunha has declined to comment on the allegations of the accounts. \nHe is considered the government\u2019s most dangerous critic because as house Speaker he has the power to kick off the impeachment process. \nBut in a possible concession to him, Celso Pansera, reported by Brazilian media to be one of Mr Cunha\u2019s close allies, was appointed science, technology and innovation minister. \nAdditional reporting by Carina Rossi  \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was 34.71119689941406 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Thomson Reuters Corp was ",
