( FCN ), the global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations protect and enhance their enterprise value, today released its U.S. Online Retail Sales Forecast: Middle Aged but Still Looking Good , which projects U.S. online retail sales of consumer goods to reach $380 billion in 2016, a 12 percent increase from expected 2015 U.S. online sales of $340 billion. \nGenerally, U.S. online sales continue to grow at low double-digit rates compared to low single-digit rates for store-based sales. However, online sales growth has slowed down slightly in recent quarters and FTI Consulting's Retail & Consumer Products practice expects this trend of gradually slowing growth and smaller gains in market share to persist as the online channel continues to mature. These trends can vary materially by product category. \nUltimately, FTI Consulting\u2019s forecast model projects U.S. online sales to reach $550 billion by 2020 and market share for online sales to be 17 percent compared to 10.5 percent currently. Looking ahead, the firm\u2019s Retail & Consumer Products practice expects overall online market share to plateau at approximately 20 percent a decade from now, as inherent limits to the channel\u2019s sales and market share potential are approached. \n\u201cDespite the online retail channel\u2019s double-digit sales growth rate, there are some distinct signs that the channel as a whole has passed peak growth and that deceleration is setting in,\u201d said Bob Duffy , Global Leader of FTI Consulting\u2019s Corporate Finance/Restructuring segment and the firm\u2019s Retail & Consumer Products practice. \u201cGiven the nature of the consumer adoption model that governs such phenomena, we can project how this maturation will occur.\u201d \nBy now, most large omni-channel retailers have successfully developed their online businesses, with many deriving 10 percent or more of total sales from the online channel. However, much of this growth has been cannibalized from stores. \n\u201cThe next challenge for these retailers will be to move beyond the objective of sales growth at any cost and to ensure that their online platforms, in concert with store-based strategies, are improving ROI of the entire enterprise rather than redirecting sales,\u201d added Mr. Duffy. \nThe full forecast can be accessed here . \nAbout FTI Consulting FTI Consulting, Inc. is a global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations protect and enhance enterprise value in an increasingly complex legal, regulatory and economic environment.
