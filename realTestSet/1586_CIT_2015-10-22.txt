The Company announced that it would explore strategic alternatives for its $10 billion Commercial Air business, and sell its CIT Canada and CIT China businesses. \u201cOver the past five years we have made significant progress in transforming CIT,\u201d said John A. Thain, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cFollowing the completion of our OneWest Bank acquisition, we have decided to explore the strategic alternatives for our Commercial Air business and to sell our non-transportation-related businesses in Canada and China. These strategic initiatives will position CIT for long-term success by further simplifying our bank-centric business model as we focus on meeting the financing needs of our U.S. small business and middle market customers. We believe these decisions will increase shareholder value.\u201d CIT maintains one of the leading commercial air franchises in the world with one of the youngest and most technologically advanced fleets. It owns, finances and manages a fleet of more than 350 commercial aircraft serving approximately 100 customers in 50 countries.
