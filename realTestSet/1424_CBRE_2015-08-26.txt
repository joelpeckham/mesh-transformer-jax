The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCBRE Group Inc. Fifth Third Center, Tampa The Atlanta-based owner of the Fifth Third Center in downtown Tampa has axed the brokerage firm that's leased the tower for 15 years. CBRE Group Inc. (NYSE: CBG) confirmed in a statement Wednesday that Colliers International Tampa Bay would begin leasing the building in mid-September. A spokesman for Colliers declined comment. Fairlead Commercial Real Estate bought the tower in July 2014 for $47.25 million and retained CBRE as its listing agent. Fairlead CEO Jeff Shaw did not respond to a request for comment. In May, $1.5 million in renovations to the tower were announced, but CBRE said in its statement that the process was \"slower than anticipated.\" Listing agreements for top-tier properties like the Fifth Third Center can represent significant commission fees and revenue for brokerage houses, as those buildings command the highest rents. The occupancy of the tower had recently dropped from 99 percent to 86 percent, according to CBRE. Here's the full statement from Chase Pattillo , managing director of CBRE in Tampa: \"Fairlead will in fact be transition leasing on the Fifth Third building to Colliers effective Sept. 15 . CBRE and Anne-Marie Ayers have leased this building for 15 years and retained leasing twice during two sales of the building, including Fairlead\u2019s acquisition in the summer of 2014. At that time, the property was 72 percent leased, and she leased it to 99 percent leased. Over her tenure she has leased over 900,000 square feet in the building (over the 15 years). Just recently property occupancy declined to current occupancy of 86 percent. \"Fairlead has recently commenced renovations on the building including common area improvements, lobby enhancements and retrofitting of the building\u2019s caf\u00e9 area. While the market has been active for higher floor spaces, there has been some challenges for some of the submarket\u2019s lower floors. As such, the smaller stature of the building has presented challenges, particularly with a slower than anticipated renovation timeline.\" \nGet Tampa Bay Newsletters and Alerts Morning Edition >> Afternoon Edition >> Breaking News \nThank you for signing up To serve you better, please select your industry and job title Industry\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CBRE Group Inc was 31.56999969482422 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CBRE Group Inc was ",
