Written by: Janet Morrissey 07/10/15 - 1:37 PM EDT Tickers in this article: BABA KIM YHOO \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) \u2014 Wondering how to get in on the planned Albertsons IPO before it goes public? Take a look at shopping center owner Kimco Realty , which currently holds a 10% stake in the closely-held grocery store chain. Internal data released with the preliminary IPO documents indicate that Kimco's stake is worth about $1.5 billion - which is much higher than previously projected in the company's share price, according to a Green Street Advisors report. In fact, it lifts Kimco's value to about $28 a share. The stock closed Thursday at $23.63 a share. \nThe New Hyde Park, N.Y. real estate investment trust is part of a consortium led by private equity shop Cerberus Capital Management LP that has been snapping up Albertsons stores for the past decade. \nThe buying spree began in 2006, when Albertsons was split into two, with a chunk of the stores being purchased by the consortium. Kimco's \"investment generated a 5x equity multiple - a clear home run,\" said Jason White, an analyst at real estate research firm Green Street Advisors, in a report. In 2013, the consortium acquired 900 stores from Supervalu , which included the Albertsons stores that were not acquired in the 2006 deal. And in early 2015, the group added Safeway to its grocery basket, and merged the Safeway stores into the Albertsons entity.
