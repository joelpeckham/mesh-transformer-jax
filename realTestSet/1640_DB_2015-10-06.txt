The yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell to 2.04 percent from 2.06 percent Monday, while the 30-year slipped 2.87 percent from 2.90 percent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was 27.11852264404297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Deutsche Bank AG was ",
