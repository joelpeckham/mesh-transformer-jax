Japanese Yen Soars as Sentiment Sours Across Financial Markets By Ilya Spivak | DailyFX \u2013 1 hour 47 minutes ago Recommend DailyFX.com - Investors don\u2019t always prize returns above all else. Consider the 2008-09 global financial crisis: Stocks, commodities and most other assets linked to global economic growth floundered in tandem as much of the world sank into recession. An investor faced with such an environment will reasonably look to pull money out of those assets that are falling and transfer them someplace safe to wait out the carnage ( such an investor is said to be to be \u201crisk-averse\u201d, meaning he/she doesn\u2019t have a lot of tolerance for risking their capital to achieve a return). What is \u201csafe\u201d? First, this would need to be an asset that is abundantly liquid. That means its supply is sufficiently ample to absorb a lot of new demand pouring out of other markets without altering the price too much in the process. Otherwise, moving money into and out of this supposedly \u201csafe\u201d asset can create a lot of volatility, which translates into a greater risk of loss. Second, this asset should be a good store of value, meaning investors\u2019 capital will not be rapidly eroded while they wait for market conditions to improve. Historically, a prominent example of this in the foreign exchange market is the Japanese Yen . It is very liquid, and perennially low inflation has mean t that the currency\u2019s purchasing power has held up well. Needless to say, that makes it a good store of value as well. Notice that \u201creturns\u201d are nowhere to be seen in this equation b ecause the focus here is to keep what you have, not grow it. This dynamic has been on full display in recent days. The Yen has moved broadly higher against its major counterparts as the S&P 500 \u2013 a benchmark for market-wide risk appetite \u2013 turned sharply lower. The US equity benchmark represents the collective earnings outlook for the world\u2019s largest public companies. Broadly speaking, these earnings are a function of the trend in global economic activity. When traders become leery about growth prospects, earnings expectations decline and trigger risk aversion, putting downward pressure on share prices. --- Written by Ilya Spivak, Currency Strategist for DailyFX.com To receive Ilya's analysis directly via email, please SIGN UP HERE Contact and follow Ilya on Twitter: @IlyaSpivak \nDailyFX provides forex news and technical analysis on the trends that influence the global currency markets.Learn forex trading with a free practice account and trading charts from FXCM . @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Related Headlines\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was 5.599999904632568 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Akari Therapeutics Plc was ",
