She provided other personal details to check against. \nMiss Brunt claims she was told no transaction could be found, so she booked the same flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai again, and paid \u00a3118. \nLater, checking her credit card statement, Miss Brunt found she\u2019d paid for two flights. \nShe then spent hours on the phone to Expedia and sent several Facebook messages while an agent tried to contact Hong Kong Airlines to authorise a refund. \nIronically, Miss Brunt chose to use Expedia to book her flight, as she thought if something went wrong, it would be easier to resolve, rather than contacting an airline based in Hong Kong. \nShe was told she could only have a part refund of \u00a345. \nExpedia claims it did all it could to find Miss Brunt\u2019s booking, searching for her first and last name, phone number, purchase information as well as potential mis-spellings of her email. \nWhen they failed to trace the transaction, the customer service agent apparently advised Miss Brunt not to book until she checked her credit card statement. \nExpedia suggests that as Miss Brunt wasn\u2019t signed into her account, her booking wasn\u2019t saved. However, it pointed out its system alerts customers to check their itinerary or email when they come back to the site to book another flight, to avoid a double booking. \nExpedia has now refunded Miss Brunt for the mistakenly booked flight, and given her a \u00a350 flight voucher as a goodwill gesture. \nMs Brunt said this was inadequate compensation for the \"the hours wasted\". \nFrank Brehany, consumer director of Holiday TravelWatch, the consumer group, was surprised by Expedia's being unable to find the booking. \nHe said if matters like this can\u2019t be resolved amicably, the next step is to try and obtain the telephone transcript to use in your favour. \nExpedia said the best way to avoid such problems is by creating an account where customer details can be saved. If customers don\u2019t sign in and are concerned about a double booking, they should check the transaction on online banking or a bank statement before trying to book again. \nHave a question for our experts?
