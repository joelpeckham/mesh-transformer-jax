Thai owner SSI has gone into liquidation, threatening 1,700 job losses at the plant and thousands more in the supply chain. \nThe Official Receiver, Ken Beasley, said: \u201cSSI was placed into liquidation with substantial debts and had no funds available to purchase the coal needed to keep the coking ovens operational. \n\u201cThere is no realistic prospect of a buyer being found and the priority now is to close the ovens down safely. I cannot continue to draw on taxpayers funds to keep the ovens operational when there is no realistic prospect that a buyer will be found. I am continuing my liquidation of the company, including talking with interested parties about purchasing the company\u2019s other assets.\u201d \nThe Government is holding a summit on Friday to discuss the crisis in the steel industry. \nBusiness Minister Anna Soubry said: \u201cI had hoped that a commercial buyer for the coke ovens could be found but unfortunately this has not happened. This news is very, very disappointing and my thoughts are with the workers and their families. \n\u201cThe government will continue to focus on making sure we do whatever we can to help people. Our package of up to \u00a380m will help with retraining and enable local firms to grow and create jobs.\u201d \nGareth Stace, director of trade body UK Steel, said: \u201cThis decision makes the possibility of rescue more remote. But it reinforces the importance of this week\u2019s summit.\u201d\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of SunCoke Energy, Inc. was 8.41995906829834 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of SunCoke Energy, Inc. was ",
