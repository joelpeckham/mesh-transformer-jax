CLEARWATER, Fla., Aug. 04, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nicholas Financial, Inc. (NASDAQ: NICK ) announced that for the three months ended June 30, 2015, diluted net earnings per share increased 18% to $0.47 as compared to $0.40 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Net earnings were $3,670,000 and $4,909,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Revenue increased 3% to $22,025,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $21,333,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Our earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2015, were positively impacted by the Company\u2019s purchase of 4.7 million of the Company\u2019s common shares by its principal operating subsidiary on March 19, 2015. Our net earnings were negatively affected by a reduction in the gross portfolio yield and an increase in the provision for credit losses, which are primarily the result of increased competition, compared to the corresponding period ended June 30, 2014. Results for the three months ended June 30, 2014 were positively affected by a decrease in income tax expense of $804,000 or $0.07 per share. This reduction related to professional fees associated with the previously announced potential sale of the Company that were not initially deductible for income tax purposes, but became deductible as a result of the termination of the Arrangement Agreement as announced on July 1, 2014. \u201cWe have opened our first branch office in Texas, specifically in Houston. We are continuing to develop additional markets within the state of Texas and subject to market conditions; we may open additional locations during the current fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate other potential markets and may open additional branch locations, although no assurances can be given. The Company is also contemplating restructuring two of its current markets, which may eliminate two of its existing branches, during fiscal 2016,\u201d stated Ralph T. Finkenbrink, President and CEO. Nicholas Financial, Inc. is one of the largest publicly traded specialty consumer finance companies based in the Southeastern states. The Company presently operates 68 branch locations in both the Southeastern and the Midwestern states. The Company has approximately 7,708,000 shares of common stock outstanding.
