BATON ROUGE, La., Sept. 02,   Amedisys, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMED ), one of America\u2019s leading home health and hospice care companies, announced today that on August 28, 2015, it entered into a new $300 million secured credit facility.

The new credit facility is with a group of banks led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Joint Bookrunners and Joint Lead Arrangers and Fifth Third Bank and Citizens Bank, N.A. as Joint Lead Arrangers. \nProceeds from the facility were used to pay off Amedisys\u2019 existing senior term loan and second lien term loan. Amedisys will pay a call premium of $700,000 associated with the second lien term loan along with transaction fees that will be reflected in results for the third quarter of 2015. The initial pricing of this new credit facility will result in an interest rate reduction of approximately 600 basis points compared to the second lien term loan. \nPaul B.
