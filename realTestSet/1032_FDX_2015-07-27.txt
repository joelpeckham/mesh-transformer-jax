Asia markets sink after US losses, eyes on Fed meeting AFP \u2013 3 hours ago View Photo \n\nAsian markets retreated Monday following a fourth successive sell-off in New York, while investors await the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting looking for a handle on its plans for interest rates. \nThe dollar also remained weak after a disappointing read on the US housing market, while oil was also under pressure owing to a global supply glut. \nTokyo eased 0.41 percent, Hong Kong shed 1.48 percent, Shanghai gave up 1.49 percent, Seoul was 0.30 percent lower and Sydney was flat. \nInvestors took a lead from their US counterparts, who continued to cash out on Friday as data showing sales of new single-family homes fell in June and May sales were much lower than previously reported. \nThe news, which followed a downbeat Chinese manufacturing report, trumped forecast-busting earnings from Amazon. \nThe Dow fell 0.92 percent, the S&P 500 dropped 1.07 percent and the Nasdaq sank 1.12 percent. \n\"Share (LSE: SHRE.L - news ) markets are likely to remain volatile as we are still going through a seasonally weak period of the year for shares,\" Shane Oliver, Sydney-based global strategist at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., told Bloomberg News. \n\"Uncertainties remain regarding Chinese economic growth and a likely Fed interest rate hike lies ahead for later this year.\" \nFocus is now on the Fed's policy meeting this week.
