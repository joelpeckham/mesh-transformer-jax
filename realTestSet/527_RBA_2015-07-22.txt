The market projects the same level of confidence. According to overnight swaps, there is a 100 percent probability that the central bank cuts. Prior to last month\u2019s rate cut the RBNZ hiked rates over a period in 2014. The current rate is 3.25% with a 25-basis-point cut due, dropping the benchmark to 3.00%, which would still qualify as the highest standard yield among G10 currencies. NZDUSD responded to the June 10 decision to cut rates with a sharp 2.5 percent tumble (over 180 pips) and continued to decline in the days and weeks after. This level of volatility is not expected according to implied volatility measures, but the air of caution is still very clear. United States Federal Reserve The Federal Open Market Committee has a rate decision planned for Wednesday July 29 th , where Chairman Janet Yellen is expected to announce a stable fed funds rate of 0.25%. In a semi-annual testimony, Yellen and other FOMC authorities took a more hawkish tone regarding a hike in 2015. Some officials went as far as to say, September would be a possibility for a 25-basis-point move, with hikes gradually after. Markets are now weighing on the possibility, as the US Dollar index advanced to 12060 in July. While a rate hike isn\u2019t expected in the July 29 th meeting, the FOMC is sure to discuss the possibility of a late 2015 increase. Commentary from the press conference as well as minutes \u2013 released after the meeting \u2013 will allow market participants to price a hike with more clarity. Bank of England The minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee\u2019s July policy meeting were released Wednesday morning at 8:30GMT. Bank of England officials voted unanimously to keep the central interest rate stable at 0.50%. Despite the conformity, the panel expressed growing favor for increasing the benchmark rate in the not-too-distant future. Hawkish committee members Ian McCafferty and Martin Weale have alluded to pushing for a small rate hike in 2015. Governor Mark Carney said remarked previously a better decision for when to begin raising rates would come at the turn of the year.
