The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThu, Jul 30, 2015, 8:12 PM NZST - New Zealand Markets closed $A slightly weaker, helped by RBA remarks AAP \u2013 26 minutes ago Print \nThe Australian dollar is only slightly lower with traders preferring to focus on optimistic comment from the Reserve Bank governor rather than disappointing housing figures. \nAt 1700 AEST on Thursday, the local unit was trading at 73.01 US cents, down from 73.21 cents on Wednesday. \nData out late in the morning showed that building approvals in June suffered their largest monthly fall in more than a year, weighed down by a large drop in the volatile high density dwellings category. \nHowever, any negativity from the figures were partly offset by earlier comments from RBA governor Glenn Stevens that there could be a big surge in investment when China liberalises its economy. \nHe predicts that capital flows in and out of China could reach $US400 billion ($A548 billion) a year. \nFXCM chief currency strategist John Kicklighter said the remarks added to the optimism that is prevalent in Asian equity markets after their falls earlier in the week. \n\"A buoyant performance in risk-leaning assets and optimistic RBA governor Stevens commentary worked to outshine a disappointing round of local data,\" he said. \n\"Thankfully, the Chinese stock market maintained its balance through Thursday's open.\" \nMr Kicklighter said that while the Chinese stock market is still down from where it started the week, a better performance for shares globally has taken the sting out of the risk-averse nature that markets had earlier in the week. \nAt 1700 AEST, the Australian dollar was at 90.66 Japanese yen, up from Wednesday's close of 90.52 yen, and at 66.60 euro cents, up from 66.28 euro cents. \nMeanwhile, the Australian bond market was weaker. \nEarly in the day, the US Federal Reserve indicated it was inclined to raise its interest rate if the economy continues to pick up but gave no hint of when that may be. \nNomura head of macro products Jon Linton said bond markets in Australia ignored the Fed statement and instead focused on improving investor confidence in Asia. \n\"They (the Fed) are prepared to hike at any point, they are data dependent and if we have strong data in the US they will hike rates but that's nothing we didn't already know,\" he said. \n\"People look around and China isn't quite as scary as we thought it was last week and appears to have stabilised a little bit, therefore, bond markets will be heavier.\" \nAt 1630 AEST on Thursday, the September 2015 10-year bond futures contract was trading at 97.120 (implying a yield of 2.880 per cent), down from 97.170 (2.830 per cent) on Wednesday. \nThe September 2015 three-year bond futures contract was at 98.050 (1.950 per cent), down from 98.100 (1.900 per cent). @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Qantas strikes new wage deal with pilots AAP \nQantas long-haul pilots have backed plans for an 18-month pay freeze, putting the airline a step closer to expanding \u2026\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ritchie Bros.
