Microsoft said last July it would slash up to 18,000 jobs. \nNadella has played up Microsoft's cloud and enterprise software capabilities, but investors have been concerned that the transition to cloud was not offsetting weakening sales of Windows and Office and a bleeding phone business. \nMicrosoft was widely expected to write off all or part of the $7.2 billion it paid for Nokia's handset unit in 2014, a deal that left the company with a struggling business and only 3 percent of the smartphone market. \nThe company announced last month that Stephen Elop, the former top boss at Nokia, would leave. \n\"Overall, we believe Nadella's proactive approach at cleaning up the Nokia acquisition is a positive \"tipping of the hand\" around Microsoft's future focus on software,\" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note. \nMicrosoft's shares rose as much as 1.4 percent on Wednesday. \nCross Research analyst Shannon Cross said she expects more cost cutting in the next couple of years as Microsoft needs to become more competitive in the smartphone market. \nThe company, which had more than 118,000 employees worldwide as of March 31, said on Wednesday it would take a restructuring charge of about $750-$850 million in its fourth quarter ended June 30. \nRBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said he estimates the latest layoffs to reduce operating expenses by more than $1 billion on an annualised basis. \nMicrosoft shares have risen about 22 percent since Nadella took over in February last year. \n(Additional reporting by Sabina Zawadzki in Copenhagen; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Microsoft Corporation was 39.50627136230469 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Microsoft Corporation was ",
