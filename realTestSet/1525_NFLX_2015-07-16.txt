It is slated to arrive in Spain, Italy, and Portugal in the final quarter of this year. \nAlong with investing in supporting more languages and show libraries tailored to various markets, Netflix is making a priority of optimizing its service on mobile devices since they are the main tools for accessing the Internet in emerging markets, according to the company.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Netflix, Inc. was 98.12999725341797 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Netflix, Inc. was ",
