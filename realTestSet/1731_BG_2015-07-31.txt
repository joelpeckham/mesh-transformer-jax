The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n1,088.563 +9.0630 \nLONDON (ShareCast) - (ShareCast News) - BG Group (LSE: BG.L - news ) posted a 65% slump in second-quarter net income on the back of declining oil prices, although the figures still came in ahead of analysts' expectations. The company, which has agreed to be bought by Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) , posted net income of $429m, down from \u00a31.21bn a year ago, on revenue of $3.98bn, down 28% from $5.50bn. \nThe drop in revenue reflects a significant fall in realised sales prices, impacting both the Upstream and LNG Shipping & Marketing segments. However, the impact of lower prices was partly offset by higher volumes in both segments, with E&P production volumes up 19% and LNG volumes up 17%. \nNet cash flow from operating activities decreased 56% to $926m. \nFor the half year, group earnings fell 58% to $994m and the company maintained its interim dividend of 14.38 cents per share. \nIt was a brighter picture in terms of production, however, which rose to record levels. Exploration and production rose 19% to 703,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the company said it now expects output for the year to be in the upper half of its forecast range of 650,000 to 690,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. \nChief executive Helge Lund said: \"We achieved a number of key milestones during the quarter while continuing to deliver on our cost and efficiency programmes.\" RBC Capital Markets said the results revealed a \"solid operational performance\" with earnings ahead of both its and consensus forecasts, which were around $317m, adding that progress at key projects continues to be positive. At 10:39, BG shares were up 0.1% at 1,081p.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bunge Limited was 66.7903823852539 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bunge Limited was ",
