I bought some during the summer, but I should have waited longer. \nThe shares now trade at 590p, 40% below their book value of 1,000p. A return to book value could generate a profit of 69%! \nHowever, I think it's more likely that the book value will fall. Anglo said today that it had cut diamond production by 27% in the face of weak demand. As diamond sales provided 30% of operating profit during the first half of the year, this isn't good news. It will increase the pressure on the firm to cut debt. \nThe market already seems to have priced in a dividend cut, as Anglo's prospective yield of 7.7% is unlikely to be sustainable. \nHowever, cancelling the dividend would only save $1bn. To raise more cash, Anglo might also need to sell some more assets or issue new shares. Both of these measures would reduce book value per share. \nHunting \nOil services firm Hunting has been hard hit by the downturn in the US shale sector. Hunting shares have fallen by 46% over the last twelve months, compared to 18% for Petrofac and 10% for Wood Group , which have less exposure to the US onshore market. \nHowever, Hunting has a fairly strong balance sheet, with net gearing of just 12%. The firm's board is taking a long-term view of the current oil market downturn and is continuing to invest in new facilities for the future. \nAnalysts expect Hunting's earnings per share to hit a low of $0.17 this year, before rising to $0.25 next year. This puts the shares on a 2016 P/E of 25 with a prospective yield of 2.6%. \nIf the oil market starts to rebalance next year and Hunting's bet pays off, it could be a smart buy. At 405p, a return to book value could generate a 43% profit. \nBarclays \nBarclays has been a poor performer this year, despite the arrival of its highly-regarded new chairman, John McFarlane. However, value investing is often a slow process and the bank's value credentials remain strong, in my opinion. \nBarclays trades at a 28% discount to its book value. The shares currently have a 2015 forecast P/E of 10.6, falling to 8.9 in 2016. The dividend yield is expected to rise from 2.6% last year to 3.6% in 2016. \nFundamentals are also improving. Barclays' common equity tier 1 ratio (CET1) rose from 10.3% at the end of 2014 to 11.1% at the end of June. Return on average shareholders' equity rose from 6.5% to 7.7% over the same period. \nOn the other hand, it's not yet clear how Barclays intends to reshape its investment banking division, nor how successful this will be. \nBarclays remains a work in progress with potential, in my view. \nInvesting in firms such as Barclays and Anglo American can be risky. Things could get worse before they start to improve. \nThat's why I'd urge anyone interested in these companies to consider the stocks featured in \" 5 Shares To Retire On \" before making any investment decisions. \nThe companies featured in this exclusive FREE report do not operate in the troubled commodity and banking sectors.
