The deal valued the entire Internet television company at more than $4.0 billion, it said. \nThe offer represents a 30.2 percent premium over the stock's closing price on Thursday, said Youku Tudou, which described the \"going private\" proposal as preliminary. \nMost of Youku Tudou's online video offerings are professionally produced content licensed from copyright holders, according to the company. \n\"Youku Tudou?s high-quality video content will become a core component of the digital products of Alibaba's e-commerce (business),\" Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said. \nAlibaba's Taobao platform holds more than 90 percent of the consumer-to-consumer market in China, while its Tmall platform is believed to command more than half the Chinese market for business-to-consumer transactions. \nBut Alibaba has also invested in its first Hollywood film, \"Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation\", acting as promotional partner in China with Paramount Pictures for the movie. \nLast month, Alibaba also set up a new company to focus on professional sports, including media, events and ticketing.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Alibaba Group Holding Limited was 71.77999877929688 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Alibaba Group Holding Limited was ",
