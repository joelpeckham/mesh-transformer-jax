These facilities are providing significant additional supply to the 1.8 million customers served by National Grid in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island. \nThe New York Bay Expansion is designed to deliver an additional 115,000 dekatherms a day of natural gas into National Grid\u2019s distribution system through the Rockaway Delivery Lateral and the Narrows meter station. That\u2019s enough gas to meet the needs of 500,000 homes and will supply National Grid\u2019s immediate and growing needs for the 2017/2018 winter. \n\u201cA reliable and resilient supply of energy is critical to the local New York and Long Island communities we serve,\u201d said Ken Daly, President, National Grid New York. \u201cWilliams\u2019 New York Bay Expansion project will help ensure affordable, cleaner, safe, reliable, secure and stable energy to meet our customers\u2019 needs and support the region\u2019s economic vitality.\u201d \nThe New York Bay Expansion Project, which is estimated to cost as much as $130 million, will include installation of additional horsepower at three existing Transco compressor facilities, in addition to uprating Transco\u2019s existing Lower New York Bay lateral and replacing approximately 0.25 miles of 42-inch pipe in Middlesex County, New Jersey. The project will also include modifications to existing Transco meter and regulator stations in Middlesex County, New Jersey, Chester County, Pennsylvania and Richmond County, New York. The work is confined to existing company property or rights of ways. \n\u201cDemand for natural gas in New York City and other major markets continues to grow as customers recognize its value as a clean, affordable and abundant energy source,\u201d said Rory Miller, senior vice president of Williams Partners\u2019 Atlantic-Gulf operating area. \u201cOur extensive footprint in North America gives Williams a strategic advantage to leverage across existing infrastructure to meet emerging needs.
