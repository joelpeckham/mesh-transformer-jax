The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNEW VIDEO-ON-DEMAND SOLUTION OVER SATELLITE WILL BE PRESENTED AT IBC 2015 Luxembourg, Munich, Germany SES Platform Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SES S.A. (NYSE Paris:SESG) (LuxX:SESG), is presenting a live showcase of LIQUID VOD, a new solution for video-on-demand services (VoD) via satellite, at IBC 2015. LIQUID VOD is an innovative way to distribute video content over satellite, delivering a real VoD user experience. The IBC live showcase demonstrates how satellite distribution can provide an instantaneous and enriched video experience on demand. This solution bridges the lack of broadband internet connectivity in underserved areas and delivers content to an ever-increasing number of users without incremental distribution cost. It is designed to deliver premium content based on available encryption systems and supports all major business models (SVoD, TVoD). \u201cIf there is one shortfall of satellite distribution in general, it is the current limitation to near-video-on-demand offerings based on fixed schedules for operators and platforms. SES is always looking to innovate and, by developing LIQUID VOD, we are very confident this obstacle will be overcome soon. There are still many areas in the world without area-wide broadband supply, and in these regions LIQUID VOD would be a perfect solution for operators to launch VoD services to exploit the growing demand for non-linear content,\u201d said Wilfried Urner, CEO of SES Platform Services. LIQUID VOD will be presented at the SES stand at Hall 1, stand 1.B51 during IBC 2015, Amsterdam.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. was 49.05467224121094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. was ",
