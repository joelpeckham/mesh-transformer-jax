 "context": "The following article called 'Capstone Acquires BHP\u2019s Arizona Copper Mine' was published on 2013-04-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCapstone Mining Corp. (CS) , the owner of\ncopper mines in Mexico and  Canada , agreed to buy BHP Billiton\nLtd.\u2019s Pinto Valley mine and a railroad in the U.S. for $650\nmillion in cash, marking its biggest acquisition.  Capstone is expected to complete the purchases in the\nsecond half of 2013, the Vancouver-based company said today in a\nstatement.  Capstone is pushing ahead with its ambition of becoming a\nmid-size copper producer by exploiting a so-called buyers\u2019\nmarket for assets held by the world\u2019s largest metals and mining\ncompanies. BHP, the world\u2019s biggest mining company, and  Rio\nTinto (RIO)  Group are among sellers seeking to shore up earnings and\ncut costs after more than $60 billion of writedowns in the\nindustry.  \u201cThis acquisition gives Capstone our third producing mine\nwith a long mine life and is consistent with Capstone\u2019s strategy\nof building an intermediate copper producer focused in the\nAmericas,\u201d said Chief Executive Officer Darren Pylot.  Pinto Valley is projected to produce 130 million pounds to\n150 million pounds of copper in concentrate and about 10 million\npounds of copper cathode a year, as well as molybdenum and\nsilver, according to the statement.  Including by-products, Capstone will produce copper at a\ncash cost of about $1.80 a pound. Copper futures for July\ndelivery climbed 1.3 percent to settle at $3.2265 a pound on the\nComex in  New York .  BHP Divestitures  BHP (BHP)  shareholders will probably respond well to the company\ndisposing of smaller assets like Pinto Valley, which have been\ntaking up \u201ctoo much management time and too much peripheral\ncapital,\u201d said Vincent Pisani, a Melbourne-based analyst at\nShaw Stockbroking Ltd. \u201cIt\u2019s taken some time, but I think BHP\nare finally getting it,\u201d he said.  The Pinto Valley deal takes BHP\u2019s divestments to $5 billion\nduring the last 12 months, according to a BHP statement today.  BHP suspended mining at Pinto Valley in February 2009 and\nsaid operations began again in the last quarter of 2012.\nCapstone, which is also acquiring the related San Manuel  Arizona \nRailroad, said BHP had spent $194 million on equipment and\ninfrastructure to enable operations to resume.  Asset Sales  BHP may potentially sell assets worth $25 billion and\nLondon-based  Rio Tinto  $10 billion, Deutsche Bank AG analysts\nsaid in a note last month.  Scotia Capital Inc. provided financial advice to Capstone\nand its directors on the deal, according to Capstone\u2019s\nstatement. Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP and Davis, Graham &\nStubbs LLP provided legal advice, the company said.  BHP rose 0.9 percent to 1,832 pence at the close in  London .\nCapstone fell 3.4 percent to C$2 in Toronto.
