 "context": "The following article called 'Credit Agricole Issues $884 Million of Kangaroo Bonds as Sales Hit Record' was published on 2010-10-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCredit Agricole SA , France\u2019s third-\nlargest bank by market value, raised A$900 million ($884 million)\nin its first issue of kangaroo bonds, helping push sales of the\nsecurities this year to a record.  The bank sold A$275 million of 6.5 percent  notes  that were\npriced to yield 6.61 percent, according to an e-mailed statement\nfrom Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which helped manage the\nsale. The Paris-based lender also sold A$625 million of\nfloating-rate notes priced to yield 125 basis points more than\nthe three-month bank bill swap rate. Credit Agricole initially\nplanned to sell at least A$300 million of notes.  Demand for the bonds due October 2013 was strong as\ninvestors sought \u201cexposure to a new name,\u201d  John Manning ,\nSydney-based senior credit strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland\nGroup Plc, said by phone today. \u201cOne of the main drivers for\noffshore issuers is that the basis swap remains attractive.\u201d  Borrowers including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and\nLandwirtschaftliche Rentenbank sold almost A$2.1 billion of\nnotes this week, taking kangaroo issuance in 2010 to an all-time\nhigh of more than A$33 billion, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co. became the first non-\nsupranational or agency issuer to sell kangaroo bonds since 2008,\nwith a A$1 billion offering in March.  Basis Swap  The basis swap, which measures the cost of exchanging\ngreenback-based debt for Aussie dollars, closed at 22 basis\npoints yesterday after averaging 10.7 basis points in the past\n10 years, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage\npoint. Borrowers typically use cross-currency basis swaps to\nexchange floating-rate payments in one currency to another.  The swap rose to a record 50 basis points on Nov. 26, due\nto an increase in U.S. dollar bond sales by Australian banks.\nThat meant kangaroo bond sellers -- who make the opposite\ntransaction -- got the biggest-ever discount.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Credit Suisse\nGroup AG, RBC Capital Markets and Credit Agricole CIB also\nhelped manage the French bank\u2019s sale of kangaroo bonds today,\naccording to the statement.  Rentenbank, Germany\u2019s development agency for agribusiness,\ntoday added A$400 million to its existing line of 6.5 percent\nkangaroo notes due in April 2017.  CIBC, Canada\u2019s fifth-biggest bank, yesterday raised A$750\nmillion in the first sale of Australian dollar covered bonds\nsince the start of the credit crisis in 2007.  The previous record for sales of kangaroo bonds,\nAustralian-dollar notes sold by foreign issuers in Australia,\nwas A$32.4 billion in 2006, according to Bloomberg data.
