 "context": "The following article called 'Absa Tanzania Unit to Boost Capital as Banks\u2019 Bad Loans Grow' was published on 2012-12-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAbsa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African\nbank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , said shareholders are in talks\nto boost capital at its Tanzanian unit to help it grow amid an\nincrease in bad debts and regulatory changes.  The National Bank of Commerce Ltd. in Tanzania remains well\ncapitalized, Johannesburg-based Absa said in an e-mailed\nresponse to questions today. A plan to raise funds in the first\nquarter of next year would support the lender\u2019s growth\nopportunities, Absa said.  NBC is considering boosting the capital it\u2019s required to\nhold against deposits by 4 percent by raising funds\n\u201cinternally\u201d and a decision will be made next month, Managing\nDirector Lawrence Mafuru said in an interview in the commercial\ncapital, Dar es Salaam. Absa owns 55 percent of NBC.  While lenders including  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  and  Ecobank\nTransnational Inc. (ETI)  have expanded in the East African nation, bad\ndebts increased at four of Tanzania\u2019s top six banks by assets in\nthe three months through September, according to Serengeti\nAdvisors Ltd., a Dar es Salaam-based research group. Impairments\nat NBC, the fourth-largest lender, grew to 14.7 percent of total\nloans in the third quarter, compared with 11.1 percent three\nmonths earlier, it said.  Federal Bank of the Middle East Ltd.\u2019s Tanzanian unit, the\ncountry\u2019s biggest lender, also reported increased bad debts\nalong with  National Microfinance Bank Ltd. (NMB)  and Standard\nChartered Bank Tanzania Ltd., Serengeti said.  Agricultural Loans  \u201cWe need the funds to allow the bank to face the market\nwith a lot more strength,\u201d Mafuru said yesterday. \u201cThe money\nwill help the bank remain within regulatory requirements of\ncapital adequacy, as we increase lending and invest in\ntechnology.\u201d  Impairments have increased partly because of the failure by\nborrowers in the agriculture industry to repay debts because of\nlower cotton prices, Mafuru said.  About a quarter of all loans in Tanzania go to the\nagriculture industry, with about 10 percent going to cotton\nfarmers, according to Mafuru. The fiber is Tanzania\u2019s second-\nbiggest export commodity, after gold, he said.  The average ratio of non-performing loans to total loans\nfor all 45 banks that operate in Tanzania was 8.1 percent in\nJune, having risen from 7.5 percent in March and 6.7 percent\nDecember 2011, according to the Bank of Tanzania.  Tanzanian lenders have the highest level of impairments in\nthe five-nation East African Community, said Abubakar Ukhotya,\noperations manager at the central bank\u2019s directorate of banking\nsupervision.  Tanzanian Growth  \u201cOur desirable levels of NPL ratio to the loan book is 5\npercent,\u201d he said in an interview. The ratio in  Kenya , East\nAfrica\u2019s biggest economy, is 5.4 percent, and 2.5 percent in\nUganda, according to World Bank data.  Tanzanian banks\u2019 assets may grow as much as 15 percent next\nyear, spurred by an accelerating economy, increased electricity\noutput and expanding manufacturing and construction industries,\nsaid Mafuru, who also heads the Tanzania Bankers Association.\nGrowth this year was 10 percent, according to Serengeti.  In the \u201cmedium term,\u201d banks in Tanzania stand to benefit\nfrom increased business from the discovery of 33 trillion cubic\nfeet of gas off its coast by companies including  BG Group Plc (BG/) \nand  Statoil ASA (STL) , it said.  \u201cThe hydrocarbon discoveries present significant\nopportunity for domestic banks to support prospective local\nsuppliers of goods and services to the large firms carrying out\nexploration and production activities in the gas sector,\u201d\nSerengeti analyst Aidan Eyakuze said in an e-mailed response to\nquestions. \u201cI anticipate further banking asset growth to be\ndriven from these activities in the medium term.\u201d  Tanzania, East Africa\u2019s second-biggest economy, may grow\n6.8 percent in 2013 compared with an estimated 6.5 percent this\nyear, according to the International Monetary Fund.  Tanzania\u2019s government owns 30 percent of NBC, while the\nInternational Finance Corp., the World Bank\u2019s private-lending\narm, holds 15 percent.  NBC last month reported net income fell by almost half to\n4.2 billion shillings ($2.6 million) in the third quarter, from\n8.2 billion shillings a year earlier.
