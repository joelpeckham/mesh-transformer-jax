 "context": "The following article called 'Irish Bet on Bond Market Return as Wine Tax Helps Cut Budget' was published on 2012-12-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIrish Finance Minister Michael Noonan\nsaid he is confident that the country can return to the bond\nmarkets as he reins in the European Union\u2019s biggest budget\ndeficit by taxing wine drinkers and mansion owners.  Noonan today laid out measures so Ireland can stick with\nits promise to the International Monetary Fund and European\nfunders of its 2010 bailout to cut the shortfall to 7.5 percent\nof gross domestic product next year. From midnight tonight, a\nbottle of wine will go up by 1 euro ($1.30), while a new\nproperty tax will come into effect in July 2013.  \u201cWe will not dither or procrastinate, but will drive\nforward to lead this country out of the despair and despondency\nand lack of self-worth in which we found ourselves in March\n2011,\u201d Noonan told lawmakers in parliament in Dublin today,\nreferring to the month when the government took power.  Ireland is about 75 percent through cuts amounting to 33.4\nbillion euros, or about a fifth of the size of the economy,\nstretched over eight years through 2015. While the deficit will\nstill be the highest in the 27-member EU for the fourth year in\na row in 2013, the austerity has been lauded by investors.  The National Treasury Management Agency plans to raise\nabout 10 billion euros in the market next year as it returns to\nsyndicated bond sales and regular monthly long-term debt\nauctions, its chief executive officer, John Corrigan, said on\nNov. 22. Ireland sold Treasury bills and bonds in July for the\nfirst time in almost two years.  Being Smart  \u201cIreland has been smart through the crisis so far by not\npromising too much too soon,\u201d said  Padhraic Garvey , head of\ndeveloped markets debt strategy at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam,\nbefore the budget was announced. \u201cAchievable targets are what\nis required to pave the way for wider market access for 2013.\u201d  The Finance Ministry forecast last week that this year\u2019s\ndeficit will be 8.2 percent of GDP compared with the 8.6 percent\ntarget it promised the IMF and EU.  Yields on the country\u2019s benchmark 2020 bond rose 2 basis\npoints today to 4.46 percent, down from 7.4 percent at the start\nof June and from as high as 14 percent in July 2011.  Stabilizing public finances are \u201can essential prerequisite\nto long-term growth and job creation,\u201d Noonan said. Ireland can\nonly access markets if investors believe that \u201cwe have a\ncredible fiscal strategy and agree that our debt is\nsustainable,\u201d he said.  Taxing Property  Ireland will introduce a property tax from July, levied at\nan annual 0.18 percent for homes valued below 1 million euros,\nrising to 0.25 percent above that threshold, Noonan said.  He will exempt new homes bought up to the end of 2016 from\nthe tax and will introduce legislation on real-estate investment\ntrusts, or REITs, to help boost the property market, whose\ncollapse triggered Ireland\u2019s economic demise.  Ireland is establishing the trusts to lure investors into\nthe commercial property market, Noonan said. Their introduction\nwill assist the National Asset Management Agency as it sells\nproperty. The agency was set up by the previous government to\ntake on bad bank debt as it propped up the financial industry.  \u201cThe property measures are also designed to create\nadditional jobs in the property and construction sectors,\u201d\nNoonan said today. Home prices, down 50 percent from their 2007\npeak, have risen in three of the past four months, according to\nthe Central Statistics Office in Dublin.  Mortgage Debt  At the same time, the government plans to tackle the levels\nof debt, a lot of which stems from the property market. The\ncentral bank is overseeing the rollout of solutions to deal with\n\u201cunsustainable personal and commercial debt,\u201d he said.  Allied Irish Banks Plc, the largest mortgage lender, has\npledged to contact 1,500 customers a month to work on\nrestructuring their home loans, he said.  \u201cThis is the level of ambition that the government expects\nfrom all banks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Irish financial crisis could be\nsummarized in one word: debt. The government is committed to\ndealing with both.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJoe Brennan in Dublin at \n jbrennan29@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nEdward Evans at \n eevans3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was 6.842342376708984 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was ",
