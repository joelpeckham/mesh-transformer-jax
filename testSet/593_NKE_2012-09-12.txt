 "context": "The following article called 'Samsung, Nike, InBev, Apple, Warhol: Intellectual Propert' was published on 2012-09-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSamsung Electronics Co. (005930) \u2019s request\nfor a judge to lift a preliminary ban on U.S. sales of its\nGalaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer was opposed by Apple Inc.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose,  California ,\nissued an order temporarily blocking sales of the Tab 10.1\ncomputer in June, almost two months before a jury found Aug. 24\nthat Samsung infringed six of seven Apple patents at stake in a\ntrial between the two companies and awarded Apple $1.05 billion\nin damages.  Apple, in a court filing Sept. 10, argued that Suwon, South\nKorea-based Samsung\u2019s effort to lift the ban should be denied\nbecause Samsung\u2019s appeal of Koh\u2019s June order \u201cdivests this\ncourt of jurisdiction.\u201d Koh has set a Sept. 20 hearing to\nconsider Samsung\u2019s request.  \u201cDissolving the injunction only to reinstate it shortly\nthereafter would cause confusion in the market and is not\nnecessary to prevent irreparable harm\u201d to Samsung, Cupertino,\nCalifornia-based Apple argued in the filing. \u201cIndeed, Samsung\nadmitted that the injunction is not likely to have a significant\nimpact on its business, given that it is already selling a\nsuccessor to the Galaxy Tab 10.1.\u201d  Koh also scheduled a Dec. 6 hearing to consider Apple\u2019s\nrequest for a permanent U.S. sales ban of eight Samsung\nsmartphone models and the tablet following the jury verdict.\nSeven of the eight smartphones that Apple seeks to ban are part\nof Samsung\u2019s Galaxy line.  Koh said previously that Apple has indicated it may seek to\nbroaden the scope of Samsung products it wants banned in a\npermanent injunction. Apple said in an Aug. 27 court filing that\nKoh should also bar U.S. sales of a version of the tablet that\nruns on mobile networks, even though that product wasn\u2019t covered\nby the Aug. 24 verdict.  Samsung sought to have the ban on the Tab 10.1 lifted on\nAug. 26 after the jury found the device didn\u2019t infringe the\nApple design patent on which the June 26 court-ordered sales ban\nwas based. The jury instead found that the Tab 10.1 infringed\nthree of Apple\u2019s software patents.  Adam Yates , a Samsung spokesman, declined to comment on\nApple\u2019s filing.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-\ncv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California\n(San Jose).  New Nike Patent Covers Golf Clubs With Data-Collecting Sensors  Nike Inc. (NKE)  wants to make improving your golf game easier.  The world\u2019s largest producer of sporting goods on Sept. 4\nreceived patent 8,257,191 , which covers the use of data-\ncollecting sensors on golf clubs to improve personalization. In\none scenario, the analysis of a swing is shown on a display\nscreen embedded on the back of the club\u2019s head. That would make\ngetting fit for golf clubs faster and more precise, the company\nsaid.  Nike has been integrating digital technology into sports\nequipment as a way for users to measure and improve results. It\nalso increases the time consumers spend with the brand, which\ncan increase loyalty and sales. The company this year introduced\na wristband that tracks daily activity and shoes equipped with\nsensors that can record such metrics as how high a basketball\nplayer jumps during a dunk.  Mary Remuzzi, a spokeswoman for Nike, declined to comment\non the patent and when such products might come to market.  The Beaverton, Oregon-based company also received patent\n8,258,941, which covers a data collection system that places\nsensors and transmitters in shoes that automatically track the\ndistance and time of a run or walk. The data would then be\nshared with the user by sending it to a mobile device or\ncomputer.  While golf equipment has become more sophisticated,\nincluding balls designed to cater to a player\u2019s strengths,\nfitting is largely a trial-and-error process, Nike said.  Technology covered by this patent would remove that\nuncertainty by using accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure as\nmany as 100 data points to record such measurements as the angle\nof the club face, Nike said.  Last month Nike obtained a patent for a computerized radar\nsystem that places sensors on soccer balls and other equipment\nas a way to offer data analysis for team sports. Other products\nin Nike\u2019s digital sport unit include a watch that can track\nlocation, distance and heartbeat and a video game workout for\n Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) \u2019s Kinect for  Xbox 360 .  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  AB InBev\u2019s Claim to \u2018Bud\u2019 Name Based on Fraud, Czech Brewer Says  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) \u2019s claim to the European Union-wide\ntrademark on the word \u201cBud\u201d for beer and other products is\nbased on a fraud that began more than a century ago, Budejovicky\nBudvar NP told a European court.  \u201cAnheuser-Busch\u2019s claim to the name is based on a fraud\nthat goes back to 1894,\u201d Fabienne Fajgenbaum, a lawyer\nrepresenting Budvar, told a three-judge panel of the EU\u2019s\nsecond-highest court in Luxembourg yesterday. \u201cWhen Mr. Busch\ndiscovered an extremely interesting beer in the town of Budweis,\nCzech Republic, he went back to the U.S. and brewed a beer in\nthe way it had been done in the region since the 13th century.\u201d  The hearing was part of a fight that started 16 years ago\nwith Anheuser-Busch\u2019s bid to get an EU trademark for the name\nBud. The EU General Court may have the final say on whether the\nworld\u2019s biggest brewer can get the sole rights to the name\nacross the 27-nation bloc.  The EU\u2019s top court last year told the lower EU court to re-\nexamine the case after making a number of mistakes in an earlier\nruling that upheld Czech competitor Budvar\u2019s challenge.  \u201cBudvar had over 100 years to start using the term Bud and\nit didn\u2019t start doing so until 1997,\u201d said Verena von Bomhard,\na lawyer representing AB InBev. \u201cBud is certainly not original\nof our Czech friends.\u201d  The EU\u2019s trademark agency -- where Anheuser-Busch sought\nthe EU trademark rights in yesterday\u2019s case in 1996, 1999 and\n2000 -- rejected Budvar\u2019s opposition on lack of evidence for its\nprior rights to the name. The Czech company markets its brew as\nBudvar in some places with the word Budweiser in smaller print\nand in others it sells beer as Bud, adding \u201coriginal Czech.\u201d  Budvar claims so-called appellation of origin or\ngeographic-indication rights, an EU protection for products\nassociated with a certain region, arguing its beer comes from\nCeske Budejovice, which is called Budweis in German. Anheuser-\nBusch, founded by a German-born immigrant to the U.S., Adolphus\nBusch, said it started using the Budweiser trademark in 1876, 19\nyears before Budvar was formed.  The cases are: T-225/06 RENV, T-255/06 RENV, T-257/06 RENV,\nT-309/06 RENV, Bud\u011bjovick\u00fd Budvar v. OHMI - Anheuser-Busch.  Apple Accuses Polish Grocery Website of Trademark Infringement  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  filed a complaint with the Polish patent office,\naccusing an online grocery website of trademark infringement,\nthe Montreal Gazette  reported .  The Cupertino, California-based company objects to the\nalleged use of the apple icon\u2019s inclusion in the store\u2019s logo,\naccording to the newspaper.  An executive for the accused store -- A.pl -- called the\ninfringement allegation \u201cludicrous,\u201d the Gazette reported.  According to the newspaper, no hearing date has been set\nfor the dispute.  For more trademark news, click here.  Copyright  Copyright Elements Tossed Out in Velvet Underground Banana Suit  The  Velvet Underground , a pop band from the 1960s, has no\n\u201crealistic prospect of injury\u201d from the owner of copyrights to\na number of the late  Andy Warhol \u2019s works, a federal judge in\n Manhattan  ruled.  The dispute between the band and the estate is related to a\ncover Warhol designed for the 1966 album \u201cThe Velvet\nUnderground and Nico,\u201d which featured a banana and the artist\u2019s\nsignature.  Even after the band broke up, it continued to use the\nbanana design, according to court papers, and licensed it for a\nvariety of  consumer goods , from  t-shirts  to  key chains  and\npillowcases. The copyright owner, the  Warhol Foundation for the\nVisual Arts Inc. , also licensed the banana design, and in 2009,\ntold the band its use of the cover design infringed the\ncopyright.  The band responded, claiming that the design had acquired\nwhat is known under U.S. copyright law as \u201csecondary meaning\u201d\nassociated with the  Velvet Underground . It, in turn, objected to\nthe foundation\u2019s licensing of the image for use with iPhone and\niPad cases and sleeves.  A suit was then filed by the band in January, seeking a\ndeclaration that the foundation had no copyright in the design,\nand accused it of infringing the Velvet Underground trademarks.  The parties then signed an agreement in which the\nfoundation agreed not to sue the band for copyright\ninfringement. Afterward, the foundation asked the court to\ndismiss the case.  In her Sept. 7 order, U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan\nsaid there was no controversy over the copyright, and dismissed\nVelvet Underground\u2019s request for a non-infringement declaration.\nThe band\u2019s trademark infringement allegations against the\nfoundation remain alive.  The case is The Velvet Underground v. The Andy Warhol\nFoundation for the Visual Arts Inc., 1:12-cv-00201-AJN, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  Minnesota Song Downloader Loses Appeal, Again Owes $222,000  A Minnesota woman accused by the music industry of\nillegally downloading songs was ordered to pay $222,000 in\ndamages after an appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling\nthat had reduced the amount.  The St. Louis-based  U.S. Court of Appeals  said in a Sept.\n11 opinion that the  record companies , which appealed the\ndistrict court\u2019s decision to assess $54,000 in damages against\nJammie Thomas-Rasset, were entitled to the larger amount. The\ncase has been tried before three juries.  U.S. District Judge Michael Davis in July 2011 reduced the\nthird jury\u2019s $1.5 million damage award to $54,000, or $2,250 for\neach of 24 recordings infringed. The music labels appealed to\nreinstate the first jury\u2019s award of $222,000. The U.S. also\nappealed, to defend the assessment of damage awards under the\nfederal Copyright Act.  \u201cThe evidence against Thomas-Rasset demonstrates an\naggravated case of willful infringement by an individual\nconsumer who acted to download and distribute copyrighted\nrecordings,\u201d the court said. \u201cWe conclude that the record\ncompanies are entitled to the remedies that they seek on\nappeal.\u201d  \u201cWe are pleased with the appellate court\u2019s decision and\nlook forward to putting this case behind us,\u201d the  Recording\nIndustry Association of America , the record companies\u2019 trade\ngroup, said in an e-mailed statement.  Thomas-Rasset was sued in 2006 and accused of downloading\n1,702 songs without authorization from the file-sharing website\nKazaa and making them available for free to other computer\nusers. For the case, the judge approved a sample of 24 songs to\nreduce the time and expense of researching copyrights.  Andrew Mohraz, a lawyer for Thomas-Rasset, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to a message seeking comment.  Three juries reached verdicts in favor of the record\ncompanies. The judge granted a second trial after the first\nbecause of an improper jury instruction. A third trial was set\nafter the record companies refused to accept the judge\u2019s\nreduction of the jury\u2019s $1.92 million award in the second trial.  The Minnesota suit was brought by labels owned by the\nworld\u2019s four largest recording companies, Sony Corp.\u2019s  Sony\nMusic Entertainment , Access Industries Holdings Inc.\u2019s Warner\nMusic Group Corp., Vivendi SA\u2019s  Universal Music Group  and\nCitigroup Inc.\u2019s EMI Group.  The appeals case is Capitol Records v. Thomas-Rasset,\n11-2820, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ( St.\nLouis ). The lower-court case is Capitol v. Thomas-Rasset,\n06-01497, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota.  Bible College Acknowledges Making Unauthorized Textbook Copies  An Australian Bible college admitted in that country\u2019s\nfederal court that it made at least 1,900 unauthorized copies of\ntextbooks produced by  smallPrint Australia  and removed the\nbranding information, the Australian newspaper  reported .  Although  TBM Training Pty Ltd.  of  Melbourne , which offers\nministry and theology courses through the Total Bible Ministry,\nacknowledges removing copyright information from the texts, it\ndenied allegations that it substituted its own brand, according\nto the newspaper.  In a court filing, the school said its staff thought\nbecause it wasn\u2019t charging students for the copies, it didn\u2019t\ninfringe anyone\u2019s copyright, the Australian reported.  SmallPrint General Manager John Loveday, which filed the\ncase against the college, told the Australian that this kind of\ncopyright infringement had become more common in  Australia  and\nthat his company had sued several other educational institutions\nfor similar actions.
