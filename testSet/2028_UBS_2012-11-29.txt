 "context": "The following article called 'SCA Property Plans to Acquire Properties From Woolworths, Coles' was published on 2012-11-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSCA Property Group (SCP) , the shopping\ncenter trust spun off by  Woolworths Ltd. (WOW) , plans to acquire malls\ndeveloped by the retailer and rival  Wesfarmers Ltd. (WES) \u2019s\nsupermarket chain Coles Ltd. to expand its asset base.  SCA Property, which listed on the Australian stock exchange\non Nov. 26., will start its own redevelopments of some existing\nmalls in the next two years, interim Chief Executive Officer\nAnthony Mellowes said. The company also expects to seek a credit\nrating next year, he said.  \u201cWoolworths and Coles will develop 50 percent of new\nneighborhood shopping centers, and they\u2019re not long-term owners\nof them, so they fit really well into this portfolio,\u201d Mellowes\nsaid in an interview yesterday. \u201cNext year sometime, we will\ninvestigate seeking a  credit rating , to access longer-term debt\noutside of Australian banks.\u201d  The listing of SCA Property, which rose 2.1 percent since\nits debut to A$1.435 as of yesterday, was the largest initial\npublic offering in  Australia  since  Westfield Group (WDC)  hived off\nownership of some of its Australian and New Zealand malls into\n Westfield Retail Trust (WRT)  two years ago. It comes as Australian\nretail sales and  consumer confidence  start to recover after 1.5\npercentage points of interest rate cuts by the central bank.  SCA Property has about A$150 million ($157 million) of\ncapacity for acquisitions before the ratio of its net debt to\ntotal assets exceeds 40 percent, the upper end of its target\nrange, James Besson, an analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a report\nthis week.  Redevelopment Plans  SCA Property -- which owns 56 completed centers and 13\nproperties under development by Woolworths across Australia and\n New Zealand  -- has no plans to build new malls, Mellowes said.  \u201cSCA\u2019s not going to be a speculative property developer,\u201d\nMellowes said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for the big development\nprofit, we\u2019re focused on yield.\u201d  UBS on Nov. 26 began coverage of SCA Property shares with a\n\u201cneutral\u201d rating and JPMorgan Chase & Co. rated the company\n\u201cunderweight.\u201d Both said SCA\u2019s lease structure -- where 61\npercent of rents come from Woolworths -- will lead to lower-\nthan-average income growth.  \u201cWoolworths leases appear to favor the tenant,\u201d Rob\nStanton, an analyst at JPMorgan, wrote in a report.  The company is seeking to cut total vacancies from the\ncurrent 5 percent to about 2 percent in the next 24 months,\nMellowes said. Woolworths has provided a rental guarantee for\ntwo years for vacant stores in completed properties and for two\nyears from completion of each mall under development, according\nto listing documents.  Mellowes, who was Woolworths\u2019 head of property operations,\nis serving in his current role while the group searches for a\npermanent chief executive, Philip Clark, chairman of SCA\nProperty\u2019s board of directors, said in a separate telephone\ninterview yesterday. Mellowes is also a candidate for the\npermanent position, which is expected to be filled in the first\nquarter of 2013, Clark said.
