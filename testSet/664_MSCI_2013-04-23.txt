 "context": "The following article called 'Treasury 10-Year Yields Rise From 2013 Lows Before Sale' was published on 2013-04-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTreasury 10-year yields rose from\nthe lowest level this year before the U.S. is scheduled to sell\n$35 billion of two-year debt, in the first of three note\nauctions this week totaling $99 billion.  The benchmark  yields  fell earlier as reports showed  China \u2019s\nmanufacturing is expanding at a slower pace and euro-area output\ncontracted for a 15th consecutive month in April. Yields pared\nlosses as purchases of new U.S. homes rose in March, capping the\nbest quarter for the industry since 2008. European stocks\nrallied the most in eight months on speculation the  European\nCentral Bank  will boost monetary accommodation. U.S. equities\ngained for a third day.  \u201cEquities are higher already today, so it\u2019s tough to say\nthe market\u2019s view of global growth has deteriorated\nsignificantly,\u201d Michael Pond, head of global inflation-linked\nresearch at Barclays Plc, one of 21 primary dealers that trade\nwith the  Federal Reserve .  Benchmark  10-year yields  were little changed at 1.70\npercent as of 12:01 p.m. in  New York , according to Bloomberg\nBond Trader data, after reaching 1.64 percent, the lowest level\nsince Dec. 12. The price of the 2 percent note due February 2023\nwas 102 23/32.  Ten-year yields were as high as  1.73 percent  yesterday,\nversus the 200-day moving average of 1.75 percent. The average\nis an indicator of momentum.  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500  Index (SPX)  gained 1 percent and the\nMSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWO)  of stocks added 1.2 percent.  Notes Auction  The two-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.23\npercent in pre-auction trading. The previous two-year auction on\nMarch 26 drew bids for 3.27 times the amount of securities\navailable, the lowest level since July 2011.  \u201cLevel-wise, these twos are pretty rich,\u201d said  David Ader , head of U.S. government-bond strategy at CRT Capital Group\nLLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . \u201cThe auction could tail a little\nbit because of the levels. The excitement in our market is not\nin the two-year sector, it\u2019s out the curve.\u201d A tail is the\namount of yield in excess of where the security was trading\nbefore the auction.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $35 billion in five-year\nnotes tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year debt the next day.  Bidding has slowed at Treasury auctions this year, with the\n$632 billion in debt sales attracting an average of $2.95 in\norders to buy per dollar of debt sold, compared with a record\n$3.15 in 2012, data released by the Treasury and compiled by\nBloomberg show.  Economic Data  The preliminary reading of 50.5 for China\u2019s  Purchasing\nManagers \u2019 Index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit\nEconomics compared with a final 51.6 for March. The figure was\nalso below the median 51.5 estimate in a  Bloomberg News  survey\nof 11 analysts. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  A composite  index  of activity in the service and\nmanufacturing industries in the 17-nation euro bloc was 46.5\nthis month, a separate report showed.  \u201cWith all the slowing data, the debate continues to be: Is\nthis just a momentary blip or a sign of things to come?\u201d said\n Adrian Miller , director of fixed-income strategies at GMP\nSecurities LLC in New York. \u201cThe home-sales figures were a push\nat best and at worst a confirmation of a brief slowing in the\nhousing market, that\u2019s all.\u201d  Sales of  single-family properties  in the U.S. climbed 1.5\npercent last month to a 417,000 annual pace from a 411,000 rate\nin February, Commerce Department figures showed today in\n Washington . The median estimate of 76 economists surveyed by\nBloomberg called for March sales to rise to 416,000.  Relative Value  U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 3 percent annual\nrate in the first quarter after growing 0.4 percent in the final\nthree months of 2012, according to the median forecast of\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News before a Commerce\nDepartment report on April 26.  \u201cPeople are starting to see  Europe  take off instead of it\nbeing an albatross or inhibiting the U.S., it\u2019s forcing people\nout,\u201d  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income\ntrading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. Treasuries are\ntrading \u201cinverse to equities,\u201d he said.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes\nexpectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, reached\nnegative 0.84 percent in the U.S, the lowest level since\nDecember. Negative readings indicate investors are willing to\naccept yields below what\u2019s considered fair value.  Treasury volatility as measured by Bank of America Merrill\nLynch\u2019s  MOVE index  fell to a record 50.58 basis points\nyesterday, below the previous low of 51 basis points reached in\nDecember. The data stretches back to 1988.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage\nbonds a month to boost the economy by putting downward pressure\non borrowing costs, including $937 million of securities\nmaturing between August 2023 and February 2031 today, according\nto the New York Fed\u2019s  website .  Treasuries have returned 0.7 percent this year, according\nto Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German  government\nbonds  have also earned 0.7 percent, the indexes show.
