The stock plunged 6.7 percent. \nM&A headlines and positive trading updates, notably from banks, failed to maintain Thursday\u2019s rally. \nDanish telecoms company TDC ( TDC.CO ) led the STOXX 600, shooting up by nearly 18 percent -- its best day since June 2007 -- after it rejected a takeover approach from Macquarie and three Danish pension funds. \nSwiss Re\u2019s ( SRENH.S ) shares were up 2.1 percent after the reinsurer said it was in talks with Japan\u2019s SoftBank ( 9984.T ) to sell a minority stake. \nFinancials limited the damage, with strong earnings from UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ). \nSocGen\u2019s shares rose by 1.9 percent after the bank reported forecast-beating results despite a quarterly drop in profit. \n\u201cFrench retail revenues better than guidance and good numbers in markets, with equity derivatives back to normal,\u201d Jefferies analysts said. \nItaly\u2019s UniCredit rose 2.1 percent after profit topped forecasts and Banco BPM ( BAMI.MI ) was up 0.3 percent after the bank raised its target for shedding bad loans. \nFrance\u2019s Pernod Ricard ( PERP.PA ), up 2.1 percent after it raised its profit goals, were among the other companies to gain after earnings statements. \n\u201cThe question was does this correction change the earnings picture or the economic picture? At this point, no it doesn\u2018t,\u201d said Pierre Bose, head of European strategy at Credit Suisse. \nAfter this week\u2019s sharp correction, valuations of the STOXX 600 have fallen back below their one-year average. \n\u201dIt\u2019s not cheap, but it\u2019s much closer to fair value,\u201c Bose said. \u201dThe market was moving close to vertically for the first few weeks of this year and absolute valuation has been a bit expensive for the past 18 months. \n\u201cFrom that point of view the correction that we\u2019ve had is actually extremely helpful.\u201d Reporting by Helen Reid; Editing by David Goodman\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Teradata Corporation was 40.099998474121094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Teradata Corporation was ",
