The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHyundai Motor Co. (005380) , the fastest growing mass-market auto group in Europe, is holding off on major expansion in the region, focusing instead on lifting profits and retaining customers with growth prospects delayed by the debt crisis.  \u201cNow is not the time to think about adding additional capacity,\u201d European Chief Operating Officer Allan Rushforth said in an interview. \u201cWhat we want to do is more efficiently and effectively use the capacity we\u2019ve got and improve the fabric of the business to improve our margins.\u201d  The Seoul-based carmaker postponed a target of selling 500,000 vehicles annually in  Europe  until next year as the sovereign-debt crisis saps demand, Rushforth said from the regional headquarters in the Frankfurt suburb of Offenbach. With growth slowing, Hyundai plans to increase advertising spending as part of an effort to boost awareness and increase loyalty as it seeks to increase market share in the region to 5 percent by 2015 from 3.4 percent now.  Hyundai and its  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  affiliate have increased combined sales by 16 percent in Europe this year, compared with a 6.6 percent drop in the total market, according to ACEA, the European car industry group.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) \u2019s sales edged up 0.5 percent, while  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Renault SA (RNO)  and  General Motors Co. (GM)  have recorded drops of more than 10 percent.  Turnaround Wait  The Korean auto group owns factories in the  Czech Republic , Slovakia and  Turkey . Hyundai today showed the five-door version of the i30 compact at the Paris Motor Show, and Kia presented the Pro_Cee\u2019d, a sporty three-door variant of the Cee\u2019d hatchback.  Even after five consecutive years of contraction, a quick turnaround in the European auto market is unlikely, said Rushforth, who expects that demand will not return to pre-crisis levels before the end of the decade.  Hyundai, which imports 10 percent of its cars sold in Europe from South Korea, has capacity for 500,000 vehicles at its plants in the Czech Republic and Turkey. It also imports vehicles made in  India  to the region. Hyundai is now forecasting sales of 450,000 cars this year.  \u201cThe cars we build are pretty good, but how we come to market is a bigger challenge right now,\u201d Rushforth said, citing Volkswagen as the standard for sales and loyalty programs in the region. Last year, VW Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn  praised Hyundai\u2019s i30 in a  video  made at the Frankfurt car show.  Rally Return  As part of the marketing push, Hyundai announced today that it plans to re-enter world rally racing in a bid to show that its vehicles can compete technically as well as on value, according to Rushforth. This summer, Hyundai also sponsored the European soccer championship, including outdoor viewing venues in Berlin, Paris and Madrid, to raise its profile.  \u201cWe are at a stage in our development where we have to work really hard\u201d on improving our sales operations, especially boosting loyalty, said Rushforth, who spent seven years working for VW and its Audi luxury unit before joining Hyundai in 2007.  That\u2019s a change in tack for Hyundai, which largely built its presence in Europe by wooing new customers with inexpensive models. Last year, 72 percent of its sales were to buyers new to the brand.  As part of the effort to encourage repeat business, Hyundai acquired its independent distributor networks in France and Germany last year to gain more control over the dealers in Europe\u2019s two biggest markets.  Also, the Korean carmaker is expanding a 2010 tie-up with  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  to provide  car loans  for buyers in the region. Hyundai already finances 39 percent of retail sales in Europe, almost double VW\u2019s 20 percent.  \u201cMost of our European competitors are busy working very hard at customer retention -- keeping the customers they\u2019ve got -- and we need to do the same,\u201d Rushforth said.
