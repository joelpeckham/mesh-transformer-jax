Mennen, based in Morristown,  New Jersey , and sold to New\nYork-based  Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL)  in 1992 for $670 million, was\nfounded in 1878. A descendant, George S. Mennen, set up a trust\nin 1970, according to formerly sealed court papers in Delaware\nChancery Court in Wilmington.  The heirs, including Kathryn Mennen, a granddaughter of\nGeorge S. Mennen, contend in a redacted complaint that\nWilmington Trust took no restorative action as George Jeffrey\nMennen, a co-trustee and her uncle, \u201cwrongly dissipated\u201d trust\nassets through investments in failing businesses.  The case is in the document-discovery stage, with the heirs\nalleging in papers made public today that the bank produced as\nevidence \u201conly self-serving legal advice favorable to\nWilmington Trust while withholding other legal advice that\nundercut its position.\u201d  Lawyers  Thomas W. Briggs Jr. , representing Wilmington\nTrust, and  Jeffrey S. Cianciulli  representing the Mennen\ndefendant, didn\u2019t immediately reply to e-mail requests for\ncomment on the suit.
