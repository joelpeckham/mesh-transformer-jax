The stocks are down 43 percent this year  \u201cThey gave a good cost target and production guidance for\n2011 was strong -- more so than expected,\u201d said  Tomas Skeivys ,\nan analyst at Terra Markets ASA with a \u201cbuy\u201d recommendation on\nthe stock, who said he would raise his target price.  The company said today it targets a full production cost at\nits Singapore plant of 97 euro cents ($1.36) a watt by the\nfourth quarter of next year, when including materials from its\nU.S. plant, down from about 1.49 euros a watt in the third\nquarter.
