(7201) , the most prolific\nelectric-car maker, plans to offer free rapid charges for its\nbattery-powered Leaf hatchback for new customers in Texas,\nexperimenting with a strategy pioneered by  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)   Starting Oct. 1, people who buy or lease a new Leaf in\nDallas, Fort Worth and Houston will get unlimited free access\nfor a year to public chargers operated there by  NRG Energy\nInc. (NRG) \u2019s  eVgo  unit, the companies said yesterday in a statement.\nThe companies may expand the service to other markets depending\non customer response, said  Brian Brockman , a Nissan spokesman.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pilot program, so we\u2019ll want to see how it goes,\u201d\nBrockman said by phone yesterday. \u201cNRG has eVgo networks in\nother markets, and we have high hopes for this program.\u201d  Nissan, along with alliance partner  Renault SA (RNO) , has become\nthe world\u2019s largest seller of autos powered solely by\nelectricity. A pricing reduction this year and low-cost lease\ndeals have helped U.S. Leaf sales more than triple through\nAugust to a record 14,123 units.  Tesla, the electric-car maker based in Palo Alto,\nCalifornia, is expanding its network of supercharger stations to\nrepower its Model S luxury sedan. Customers who buy 85 kilowatt-hour-battery versions of the car, or an optional upgrade to the\nbase model, are guaranteed free charges at the stations for\nlife.  \u2018Medium-Sized Enticement\u2019  The offer of free fuel for the Leaf will be an enticement\nfor some buyers, \u201cbut I\u2019d call it a medium-sized enticement,\u201d\nsaid Jack Nerad, industry analyst and executive editor for\nKelley  Blue Book  in  Irvine , California.  \u201cFor the right person, near these charge stations, it\ncould be a good thing and have some appeal,\u201d Nerad said. \u201cBut\nit\u2019s still striking me that in most instances, an electric car\nwill mainly be a second or third vehicle for most people,\nbecause of the range limitations and how long it takes to charge\nthem.\u201d  The 2013 Leaf, built at Nissan\u2019s Smyrna, Tennessee, plant,\naverages 75 miles (121 kilometers) per charge. Repowering the\ncar\u2019s depleted lithium-ion battery pack takes about four hours\nfrom a 240-volt charger. EVgo\u2019s direct-current fast chargers can\nrepower the battery to 80 percent in 30 minutes, Brockman said.  The North American unit of Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan is\nin Franklin, Tennessee.
