The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHog futures fell for the third time\nthis week on speculation that U.S. meatpackers will slow\nlivestock purchases as they cut back on slaughtering for the\nIndependence Day holiday on July 4. Cattle were steady.  \n Some grocers may wait until next week to restock shelves\nwith pork and beef, said  Lawrence Kane , a market adviser at\nStewart-Peterson Group in Yates City, Illinois.  Spot-market hog \nprices are down 1.6 percent this week and  cattle  are little\nchanged, as meatpacker demand slumps, U.S. Department of\nAgriculture data show.  \n \u201cWith the long weekend, packer activity is diminishing\nrapidly,\u201d Kane said. Food retailers \u201cbought already for the\nFourth of July, so everybody is waiting and seeing what\ndisappears, before they look next week to see what they need to\nbuy.\u201d  \n Hog futures for August settlement dropped 0.2 cent, or 0.2\npercent, to 81.45 cents a pound at 11:32 a.m. on the Chicago\nMercantile Exchange. Futures declined 1.5 percent in the three\nmonths ended yesterday, the first drop in three quarters.  \n Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.075 cent to 89.95\ncents a pound on the CME. The most-active contract dropped 3.8\npercent in the second quarter, the first decline in five\nquarters. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.375\ncent, or 0.3 percent, to $1.12675 a pound.  \n Livestock futures pared losses as the dollar dropped,\nraising speculation that U.S. meat exports will increase.  \n The  dollar  sank to a seven-week low today against a basket\nof six major currencies. The U.S. sold 21 percent more beef to\noverseas buyers in the four weeks ended June 24 than a year\nearlier, the USDA said today.  \n \u201cFor the countries that do have some money, the cheaper\ndollar makes our meat look a little more viable,\u201d Kane said.  \n Wholesale  choice beef  fell 0.1 percent at midday to $1.5536\na pound, the first drop this week. Wholesale  pork  prices have\ndropped 2.9 percent in the past four sessions to 81.8 cents a\npound yesterday, the lowest level since June 16.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Whitney McFerron  in Chicago at \n wmcferron1@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CME Group Inc. was 35.365478515625 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CME Group Inc. was ",
