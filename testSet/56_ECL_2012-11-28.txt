 "context": "The following article called 'Ecolab\u2019s Nalco Dismissed From Lawsuits Over 2010 BP Spill' was published on 2012-11-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEcolab Inc. (ECL) \u2019s Nalco Holding Co.\nunit, which provided a chemical dispersant used to deal with the\n2010  BP Plc (BP/)   Gulf of Mexico   oil spill , has been dismissed from\nlawsuits over the incident.  BP used the Nalco dispersant to break up oil and reduce the\nharm to the  Gulf Coast  following the explosion and sinking of\nthe Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April 2010. Plaintiffs\nsued Nalco, claiming the dispersant, called Corexit, was\ndefective and more toxic than the oil itself.  Nalco said the claims for exposure-related injuries were\npreempted by federal law giving the government authority to\ndirect all actions to remove a substantial spill. U.S. District\nJudge  Carl Barbier  in  New Orleans  agreed, finding today that the\nclaims were preempted by the U.S. Clean Water Act and the\nNational Contingency Plan, which put the government in charge of\nthe response.  \u201cNalco did not decide whether, when, where, how or in what\nquantities Corexit was applied in response to the Deepwater\nHorizon/Macondo Well oil spill,\u201d Barbier said in a 36-page\nopinion today.  Barbier also said allowing such claims might harm an all-\nout response to future spills.  \u201cIf the court were to permit\u201d the claims against Corexit,\neven if the product was found to be defective or dangerous,\n\u201cthen during the next substantial spill or \u2018spill of national\nsignificance,\u2019 the threat of liability might cause the\nmanufacturer of dispersant X to refuse to provide its product,\u201d\nBarbier said.  \u2018We\u2019re Ecstatic\u2019  Barbier said he wasn\u2019t considering whether Corexit was\ntoxic or defective, just that the claims against Nalco had to be\ndismissed as a matter of law.  \u201cWe\u2019re ecstatic,\u201d Michael J. Monahan, spokesman for  St.\nPaul , Minnesota-based Ecolab, said today. \u201cIts a vindication of\nthe position we\u2019ve had all along,\u201d he said in a phone\ninterview.  Steve Herman , an attorney for the plaintiffs, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to an e-mail for comment on the dismissal.  The lawsuit is part of In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig\nDeepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010,\nMDL-2179, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana\n(New Orleans).
