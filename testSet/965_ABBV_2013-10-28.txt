 "context": "The following article called 'Bristo-Myers Shares Rise on Drug Trial Results' was published on 2013-10-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  rose to its\nhighest closing price since 2001 after releasing trial results\nthat showed its experimental drugs for  lung cancer  and\nrheumatoid arthritis helped patients.  Bristol-Myers rose 6.7 percent to $52.02 at 4 p.m.  New York \ntime, the highest closing value since December 2001 and the\nbiggest one-day gain since March 2009. The New York-based\ncompany released data over the weekend that showed its top\npipeline project, an immune-system based cancer treatment,\nextended the lives of lung cancer patients. The company\u2019s\nexperimental rheumatoid arthritis treatment was found to be\nabout as effective as a current standard treatment sold by\n AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) , a study found.  In a trial of 418 rheumatoid arthritis patients, 78 percent\nof those who took Bristol-Myers\u2019s clazakizumab with methotrexate\nreduced their symptoms by at least 20 percent, the company said.\nThat was twice the rate of patients who took only methotrexate,\na generic treatment for the disease. Of patients taking\nmethotrexate and Humira, AbbVie\u2019s injectable drug that  sold \n$9.27 billion last year, 76 percent had symptoms fall by at\nleast 20 percent.  \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging, especially since they had a comparator\narm there with Humira plus methotrexate,\u201d said Grant Louie, a\nrheumatologist and professor of medicine at  Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Medicine . \u201cIt does appear to be\ncomparable.\u201d  Sales Returning  Bristol-Myers\u2019s  sales  are returning to growth after patent\nexpirations shrank revenue in the past five quarters, led by the\nloss of marketing exclusivity for the anti-stroke pill Plavix.\nNew products, led by the company\u2019s cancer and hepatitis C\nfranchises, are emerging and may boost sales further.  The company on Oct. 25 also released additional survival\ndata on nivolumab, its experimental lung cancer treatment. The\nstudy showed that 42 percent of treated patients were alive\nafter a year, and 24 percent after two years. The two-year\nsurvival data are an improvement over previous results and are\n\u201creasonably encouraging,\u201d  Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst with\nInternational Strategy & Investment Group LLC, said in a note to\nclients.  Bristol-Myers is deciding whether to move clazakizumab, the\nrheumatoid arthritis drug, into the final of three stages of\nclinical trials usually required for approval before applying\nfor marketing clearance, said Pushkal Garg, a Bristol-Myers\u2019s\nhead of immunoscience development.  Development Path  \u201cWe\u2019re very excited about the results here, and we\u2019re\nmapping out the next phases of the development plan,\u201d Garg said\nin a telephone interview.  Rheumatoid arthritis causes inflammation of the joints,\noften in the hands and feet. It is thought to be caused by\nproblems with the immune system, according to the U.S. Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. About  1.5 million\npeople  in the U.S. have it, according to the Arthritis\nFoundation.  Clazakizumab\u2019s biggest difference may be in getting a\nportion of patients in remission from the disease, or reducing\nits symptoms severely, Garg said.  \u201cWhere we really see the unmet need for clazakizumab, is\nyou have 70 percent or more of patients who don\u2019t get into\nremission,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really want to try and get patients\ninto remission.\u201d  Symptoms Reduced  The drug cut symptoms of the disease by 70 percent for 27\npercent to 38 percent of patients in the study compared with 19\npercent on Humira. Measures of remission were also greater on\nclazakizumab than on Humira, according to the study.  The data were released as part of the American College of\nRheumatology annual meeting in  San Diego .  Future trials will need to show the drug\u2019s side effects are\nmanageable, especially since doctors are already familiar with\ntreatments on the market. Patients in the study released today\nhad reactions at the injection sites at a higher rate than those\ntaking Humira, and the drug also raised cholesterol levels and\nliver enzymes that could signal toxicity.  \u201cThat could raise concerns for the patient and the\nregulatory agency,\u201d Louie said. \u201cOften in the real world,\npatients say, \u2018To heck with it,\u2019 and discontinue medication\ninstead of dealing with it.\u201d  Bristol-Myers hasn\u2019t touted clazakizumab much to  investors ,\nwith executives focusing on the experimental drugs for cancer\nand hepatitis. If successful in final stage trials, it would\ncompete with the multibillion-dollar drugs that currently\ndominate for rheumatoid arthritis, Humira and Enbrel, which is\nsold by  Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)   Drug Deals  Bristol-Myers bought the drug in 2009 from closely held\nAlder Biopharmaceuticals Inc. The deal gave Alder an initial\ncash payment of $85 million, and as much as $764 million in\nmilestone payments and the potential for more than $200 million\nin payments and royalties if the drug gets to market.  Rheumatoid arthritis patients typically start treatment\nwith methotrexate, a cheaply available generic drug. If\nmethotrexate doesn\u2019t work or becomes less effective, doctors can\nadd a therapy such as like Humira or Enbrel. There\u2019s no cure for\nthe chronic disease.  Clazakizumab works through a pathway called IL-6, helping\nto block the inflammatory effects of rheumatoid arthritis.\nBasel,  Switzerland-based Roche Holding AG  has a related drug,\nActemra, which sold $898 million last year. AbbVie, based in\nNorth Chicago,  Illinois , is developing a drug that uses the IL-6\npath, ALX-0061, which it licensed from Ablynx last month in a\ndeal worth as much as $840 million.  The study didn\u2019t offer data on another measure of disease\ncontrol, called radiographic progression, that uses imaging to\nmeasure the breakdown in joints, Louie said. That may be an\nimportant measure for regulators when the decide whether to\napprove a drug.
