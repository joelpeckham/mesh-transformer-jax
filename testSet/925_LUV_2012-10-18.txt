 "context": "The following article called 'Southwest Curbs Labor Spending After 13% Cost Growth' was published on 2012-10-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSouthwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , the discount\ncarrier that has never had layoffs, plans to shrink its\nworkforce amid spending cuts of at least $100 million after\nhigher fuel prices helped cost increases outstrip sales growth.  Southwest, which reduced its staff by 1,400 with buyouts in\n2009, will be \u201ctrimming our total headcount complement\noverall,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said today in a\nmessage to employees. While he declined in an interview to\ndetail how that might be done, Kelly later said on a conference\ncall that the airline isn\u2019t contemplating layoffs.  Southwest\u2019s expenses grew by almost 13 percent through the\nfirst nine months of this year, outpacing a 12 percent rise in\nsales. Holding down costs is central to the Dallas-based\nairline\u2019s business plan because it allows Southwest to remain\nprofitable while offering lower fares that win customers.  \u201cWe\u2019ll be very aggressive with our cost controls next\nyear,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of concerns about high\n fuel prices  and economic uncertainty.\u201d  The carrier has focused more in the past few years on\nbuilding revenue than on expenses, Kelly said. Southwest\npreviously has said it won\u2019t add to its fleet of 692 aircraft\nuntil it hits certain financial targets, including a 15 percent\nreturn on invested capital. The return was 7 percent in the 12\nmonths through Sept. 30.  \u2018Commodity Business\u2019  The airline\u2019s cost to fly each seat a mile, a measure of\nefficiency, rose 5 percent in the third quarter and 3.7 percent\nin the nine months through September. Fuel costs increased 11\npercent in the first three quarters, and Southwest expects\nprices to climb again before year end.  \u201cAt the end of the day, airlines are largely a commodity\nbusiness,\u201d said Savanthi Syth, a Raymond James & Associates\nInc. analyst based in St. Petersburg,  Florida , with an\noutperform rating on the shares. \u201cIn that type of environment,\nservice is important, but maintaining lower costs is\nessential.\u201d  The airline is evaluating ways to reduce supplier costs and\nsupport from outside vendors and consultants, Kelly said, in\naddition to \u201clooking for opportunities to stop doing some\nthings that don\u2019t have value.\u201d  Southwest, which has never laid off  workers , isn\u2019t\nconsidering a hiring freeze at this point, he said. The carrier\nhas offered early retirement programs for employees in the past.  Southwest had 46,048 workers at the end of September, up\n2.1 percent from a year earlier.  \u2018Hiring Frost\u2019  \u201cIf nothing else, there\u2019s frost on the hiring front,\u201d\nKelly said. \u201cIt\u2019s very fair to say there will be much stricter\ncontrols surrounding hiring for next year. We will hire more on\nan exception basis versus business as usual.\u201d  The airline\u2019s stock climbed 0.34 percent to $8.98 at the\nclose in  New York  trading. The shares have gained 4.9 percent\nthis year, compared with a 16 percent increase in the Bloomberg\nU.S. Airlines Index.  Southwest is \u201cclearly seeing some weakness in the economy\nand in demand,\u201d primarily among business travelers, Kelly said.\nSo far in October, however, passenger revenue from each seat\nflown a mile is running about 4 percent ahead of a year earlier,\nhe said.  Cutting spending is complicated by the ongoing work to\nintegrate AirTran Airways, which Southwest acquired last year,\nKelly said. He declined to discuss additional cost-reduction\nplans under review.  Third-quarter profit  fell to $97 million, or 13 cents a\nshare excluding one-time items, on weaker travel demand and a\nlower average fare, Southwest said. That compared with earnings\nof $122 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier.  Replacing Aircraft  The result was a penny above the average 12-cent estimate\non that basis from 16 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were\nflat at $4.31 billion.  Southwest will begin implementing a new revenue-management\nsystem next year and will further integrate its network with\nthat of AirTran. The carrier reported $110 million in pretax\nsynergies from combining the companies through September and\nexpects $400 million next year.  The airline is in the midst of a program to boost the\nnumber of seats on some planes and is replacing older aircraft\nwith new, more fuel-efficient versions of the  Boeing Co. (BA)  737.\nEfforts to modernize the fleet will add more than $700 million\nin pretax results each year once fully put in place in 2015.
