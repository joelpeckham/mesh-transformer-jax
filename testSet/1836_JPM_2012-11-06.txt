 "context": "The following article called 'Deutsche Bank Rejects FERC Penalty for Market Rigging' was published on 2012-11-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Bank AG (DBK) \u2019s energy trading\nunit denied manipulating power markets and told the U.S. Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission it should drop a proposal that the\nbank pay a $1.5 million fine and give up $123,198 in profit.  FERC\u2019s enforcement staff, in a Sept. 5 order, said Deutsche\nBank Energy Trading LLC submitted false information related to\nits energy trading in California in early 2010.  \u201cThe legal position enforcement has taken here is\nradical,\u201d the unit of the Frankfurt-based bank said in a filing\nposted today on FERC\u2019s website. \u201cIf the commission does not\nabandon these deeply flawed allegations now, they will be\noverturned by a federal district court.\u201d  Agency spokesman Craig Cano said FERC had no comment on the\nfiling. \u201cThe commission will consider the response,\u201d he said\nin an e-mail.  FERC also is investigating alleged manipulation by traders\nfrom  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  as part of an\nincreased effort to monitor markets where electricity is bought\nand sold. Since January 2011 the agency has announced 11 market-\nmanipulation probes, and in March it reached a record $245\nmillion settlement with Constellation Energy Group Inc. over one\nof those cases.  Deutsche Bank said in its filing that the energy-trading\nunit \u201cdid not intentionally trade against its interests,\u201d as\nthe regulatory\u2019s enforcement unit concluded after an\ninvestigation.  \u2018Arbitrage Opportunities\u2019  \u201cTraders saw arbitrage opportunities -- the chance to \u2018buy\nlow and sell high\u2019 -- because prices\u201d at one power-delivery\npoint were \u201csignificantly\u201d lower than at another location,\naccording to the filing.  The agency\u2019s enforcement office took the position that\n\u201cknowingly trading in two related markets is per se unlawful\nmarket manipulation, even if the trading is profit-seeking in\nboth markets,\u201d Deutsche Bank said in its filing. \u201cAccepting\nthat mistaken contention would mark a sea change in commission\nprecedent.\u201d  FERC on Oct. 31 proposed a record $469.9 million in\npenalties against London-based Barclays and an additional $18\nmillion on four of the company\u2019s former traders who allegedly\ngamed markets in the Western U.S. It gave Barclays and the\nindividuals 30 days to respond.  The agency is investigating a unit of New York-based\nJPMorgan for allegedly gaming energy markets in  California  and\nthe Midwest, resulting in at least $73 million in improper\npayments to generators.
