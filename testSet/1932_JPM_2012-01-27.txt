 "context": "The following article called 'Stalled Tax Boost Risks Japan Bond Slump as Noda Fails to Get LDP Backing' was published on 2012-01-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  says doubling the consumption tax is a necessary remedy to\naddress soaring debt and social welfare costs. His opponents\ndon\u2019t disagree; they\u2019re just not going to let him do it.  The main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party  has rejected\nrepeated calls to negotiate on the proposal and instead demanded\nnew elections, as polls show 60 percent of voters oppose the\nlevy and Noda\u2019s popularity plunging. LDP lawmaker Ichita Yamamoto in an interview said \u201craising the consumption tax is\nimpossible\u201d under Noda\u2019s watch.  Failure to reach a compromise threatens to deepen the\nstagnation underscored by six prime ministers since 2006 and an\neconomy struggling to recover from last year\u2019s earthquake and\nnuclear disasters. The impasse could also push up bond yields,\ndepriving the government of financing a record debt burden with\nthe world\u2019s second-lowest borrowing costs.  \u201cIf Noda fails, it will have a very big impact on the\nmarket,\u201d former  Bank of Japan  Deputy Governor Kazumasa Iwata\nsaid in a Jan. 25 interview.  Iwata said the possibility of an \u201cunusual shock\u201d can\u2019t be\nruled out, comparing the risks to the  bond market  with two\nepisodes when shifts in sentiment caused  yields  to spike.\nBetween October 1998 and February 1999, and again between June\nand September 2003, yields on 10-year bonds more than tripled.  Yields Fall  The prospect of escalating borrowing needs has yet to hit\n Japan \u2019s securities, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year\ngovernment bond dropping one basis point, or 0.01 percentage\npoint, to 0.965 percent at 10:30 a.m. in Tokyo.  The government may have a revenue shortfall of 50.8\ntrillion yen ($656 billion) in the fiscal year starting April\n2015 without an increase in the  sales tax , according to a\nfinance ministry report obtained by Bloomberg News. Such a gap\nwould contrast with the Noda administration\u2019s pledge to limit\nnew bond sales to about 44 trillion yen a year through fiscal\n2014.  Noda on Jan. 24 renewed his call for dialogue on the\n Democratic Party of Japan \u2019s plan to raise the sales tax to 8\npercent in April 2014 and 10 percent in October 2015. A Cabinet\nOffice report the same day said the government will probably\nmiss its goal of balancing the budget by 2020 even if the plan\npasses, and officials have said further increases are likely.  Rising Discontent  A Mainichi newspaper survey  published  Jan. 23 said the\nproportion of the public opposed to the increase rose to 60\npercent from 54 percent in December. Noda\u2019s approval rating fell\nto 32 percent from 38 percent, and is down 24 percentage points\nsince he became the DPJ\u2019s third leader since 2009, when it\nousted the LDP from half a century of control.  LDP leader Sadakazu Tanigaki has said Noda\u2019s party reneged\non pledges to cut spending and overhaul the pension system, and\nshould call new elections. His legislators say that, while\npublic discontent over the deadlock may hurt their party as\nwell, defeating the DPJ takes precedence. The Mainichi poll put\nruling party support at 17 percent and the LDP\u2019s at 16 percent.  \u201cMany people hate us, and this is serious,\u201d Yamamoto\nsaid. \u201cThe point is there won\u2019t be a breakthrough if the\ncurrent situation continues.\u201d  LDP lawmaker Takeshi Noda, who isn\u2019t related to the prime\nminister, says ruling party dissension undercuts the government.\nNine DPJ legislators opposed to raising the  consumption tax  left\nto form their own party and other members have expressed\nreservations.  \u2018Split in Two\u2019  \u201cThe ruling party is split in two,\u201d said Noda, who is\nhead of the LDP\u2019s tax panel. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to ask for opposition\nsupport before he unites his own party. The bill won\u2019t pass the\nlower house.\u201d  At the same time, the LDP\u2019s own platform calls for raising\nthe consumption tax and Tanigaki, a former finance minister,\ncalled for doubling the levy in 2006. Opposition lawmakers have\ncriticized Prime Minister Noda\u2019s inability to cut spending. The\nDPJ has yet to come up with the 16.8 trillion yen ($216 billion)\nin revenue it pledged to find by reducing \u201cwasteful\u201d outlays.  Social-security expenses, which have more than doubled in\nthe past two decades, will account for 52 percent of general\nspending in the fiscal year beginning April 1.  \u201cThe LDP also proposes raising the consumption tax to 10\npercent, so the number is fine,\u201d Liberal Democratic legislator\nand former Credit Suisse First Boston economist Yukari Sato said\nin an interview. \u201cBut the government plan lacks specifics in\ncutting social security expenses. An election should be held to\nbreak through the current sense of frustration.\u201d  Election Dispute  Deputy premier  Katsuya Okada , whom Noda appointed this\nmonth to lead the tax increase effort, has repeatedly rejected\nthe notion of going to the voters before the legislation passes.  \u201cDecisions have to be made,\u201d Okada said Jan. 22 on Fuji\nTelevision. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for an election.\u201d Two days ago\nOkada said that even a 10 percent increase in the sales tax\n\u201cwill be insufficient\u201d to sustain the pension fund system in\nthe world\u2019s most rapidly aging society.  Political squabbling may imperil Japan\u2019s credit.  Standard &\nPoor\u2019s  in November said it may be preparing to lower the\nsovereign rating given Noda\u2019s lack of progress in tackling the\ndebt issue. S&P rates Japan AA- and has had a negative outlook\nsince April.  Japan\u2019s politicians \u201chave to look around the world,\nespecially at the European debt crisis,\u201d said Masaaki Kanno,\nchief economist in  Tokyo  at JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. and a\nformer Bank of Japan official. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to waste.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nSachiko Sakamaki in Tokyo at \n ssakamaki1@bloomberg.net ;\nTakashi Hirokawa in Tokyo at \n thirokawa@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJohn Brinsley at \n jbrinsley@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 28.49544906616211 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
