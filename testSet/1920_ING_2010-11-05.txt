 "context": "The following article called 'Taiwan Consumer Prices Rise a Second Month After Typhoon Pushed up Costs' was published on 2010-11-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTaiwan\u2019s  consumer prices  rose for a\nsecond straight month after a typhoon destroyed crops, pushing\nup food and transportation costs.  The consumer price index advanced 0.56 percent in October\nfrom a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in Taipei today.\nThat compared with the median  estimate  for a 0.3 percent\nincrease in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 economists. Prices\nrose a revised 0.28 percent in September.  Taiwan  is on course to be one of the world\u2019s fastest-\ngrowing economies this year after expanding 13.1 percent in the\nfirst half. While the recovery has failed to ignite overall\ninflation, the central bank raised borrowing costs in September\nfor the second time in 2010 to ward off a property bubble.  \u201cIn an environment where the global economy is looking\nhealthier,\u201d the central bank will probably raise the benchmark\ninterest rate by another 0.125 percentage point in December,  Tim Condon , head of Asia research at ING Groep NV, said before the\nrelease. The bank may boost borrowing costs by a total of 0.75\npercentage point within a year from the current rate of 1.5\npercent, he said.  Today\u2019s report was released after the close of trading on\nthe stock exchange. The Taiex index climbed 1.1 percent. The\nTaiwan dollar closed 0.1 percent higher at NT$30.560 versus the\nU.S. currency, and rose as much as 1.8 percent earlier, its\nbiggest daily gain since January 2000, according to Taipei Forex\nInc.  Typhoon Megi caused agricultural losses of NT$136 million\n($4.5 million) in October, the Taipei-based Council of\nAgriculture said in a statement on its website on Nov. 2.  Food Prices  Food prices rose 0.23 percent from a year earlier, today\u2019s\nreport showed. The price of transportation advanced 1.22 percent\nand clothing prices climbed 0.16 percent.  Core consumer prices , a category excluding vegetables,\nfruit, fish and energy, increased 0.57 percent after gaining\n0.71 percent in September.  Wholesale prices, which track the cost of goods sold to\nretailers and producers, climbed 3.84 percent from a year\nearlier, compared with a revised 3.79 percent increase in\nSeptember.  Inflation this year may be less than the 1.23 percent\nestimated by the statistics bureau,  Perng Fai-nan , the governor\nof the central bank, said last month. It may exceed that figure\nin 2011, he also said.  Perng and the policy board raised the benchmark interest\nrate to 1.5 percent in September.
