 "context": "The following article called 'Canada's Dollar Posts Declines Versus Greenback, Euro as Oil Price Slumps' was published on 2010-10-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanada\u2019s dollar depreciated against\nthe greenback and traded near a seven-month low versus the euro\namid a decline in crude oil as traders bet the country\u2019s central\nbank is through with interest-rate increases until next year.  Canada\u2019s currency, nicknamed the loonie, reached parity on\nOct. 14 for the first time since April. It has weakened 2.2\npercent since then. The U.S. dollar reversed earlier declines\nand strengthened against 14 of its 16 most-traded counterparts.\nThe loonie is poised for a 1.5 percent decline on the week\nversus the greenback, after appreciating for seven straight\nweeks, and it\u2019s up 0.3 percent this month and up 2.6 percent\nthis year.  \u201cBroader U.S. dollar movements, rather than anything\nCanadian-dollar specific,\u201d are hitting the loonie,  Shaun Osborne , chief currency strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank,\nsaid via e-mail. \u201cU.S. dollar dips are providing an opportunity\nfor shorts to cover ahead of looming event risk,\u201d he said,\nreferring to a Federal Reserve meeting on Nov. 2-3.  The loonie dropped 0.6 percent to C$1.0267 per U.S. dollar\nand fell 0.3 percent to C$1.4293 against the euro at 5:04 p.m.\nin Toronto. It touched C$1.4334 per euro yesterday, the weakest\nlevel since March 1. One Canadian dollar buys 97.42 U.S. cents.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  told reporters in\nOttawa yesterday there are expectations for more monetary\nstimulus from the Fed. He left the benchmark overnight interest\nrate at 1 percent two days ago, and a day later said gross\ndomestic product likely grew 1.6 percent in the third quarter,\nless than a July prediction of 2.8 percent.  Carney Futures  Futures prices indicate Carney may not raise rates for six\nmonths. The rate on the six-month overnight index swap, a gage\nof what investors think the policy rate will average during that\ntime, ended yesterday at 1.05 percent, down from 1.17 percent on\nSept. 16, indicating rate-rise bets are dwindling.  \u201cWith rate hikes off the table for a while in Canada and\nthe market tying us so tightly to the U.S. economy, the Canadian\ndollar should continue to lag on the crosses,\u201d  Blake Jespersen ,\ndirector of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal in Toronto,\nsaid via e-mail.  The MSCI World Index of equities fell 0.2 percent. Crude\noil futures, Canada\u2019s largest export, declined 1.4 percent\npercent after earlier rising as much as 1.1 percent.  Shorter-term government bonds fell, driving the two-year\nyield up two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.38\npercent. The price of the 1.5 percent security maturing in\nDecember 2012 dropped 4 cents to C$100.24.  The greenback is the worst performing major currency during\nthe past three months on speculation that Fed officials will\nsignal further measures are needed as part of the central bank\u2019s\nquantitative-easing plan to support growth. The currency of\nCanada, which ships about two-thirds of its exports to the U.S.,\nis the second-worst performer.  \u201cWhen the U.S. dollar is under pressure we have, over the\nlast three months, seen the Canadian dollar underperform versus\nthe other majors,\u201d  Jeremy Stretch , global head of foreign-\nexchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\u2019s CIBC\nWorld Markets unit, wrote via e-mail. \u201cThat scenario may\ncontinue to play out, but the conservative Canadian dollar may\nbenefit versus the previously top performers when and if we see\na U.S. dollar snapback.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Chris Fournier  in Montreal at \n cfournier3@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDave Liedtka at   dliedtka@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 34.330299377441406 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
