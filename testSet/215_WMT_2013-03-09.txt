The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) \u2019s reputation\nmanagement chief, a former Democratic strategist, is leaving in\nJune, the company said yesterday in a memo.  Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs Leslie A. Dach, 58, has been responsible for public policy, government\nrelations, corporate communications and sustainability\ninitiatives. Wal-Mart is searching for a successor, Chief\nExecutive Officer  Mike Duke  said in the memo to employees. The\nannouncement came as U.S. regulators continue to probe\nallegations of bribery in Wal-Mart\u2019s Mexico operations.  Dach, who commutes weekly between his Washington home and\nthe company\u2019s Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters, told Duke\nthat now is the \u201cright time\u201d to leave, Duke said in the memo.  When Dach\u2019s appointment was announced in 2006, observers\nincluding Patricia Edwards, then a  money manager  at Wentworth,\nHauser & Violich, said Dach would help Wal-Mart augment its\nimage. At the time, critics said the company needed to improve\nworking conditions for its employees -- complaints still voiced\nby union-backed groups such as OUR Walmart.  Before joining the world\u2019s largest retailer, Dach held\nsenior positions in Democratic presidential campaigns and\nhandled work for the Clinton administration, according to his\nbio page on Wal-Mart\u2019s website. He has served on the government-\nrelations staffs of the National Audubon Society and the\nEnvironmental Defense Fund.  Edelman Connection  Dach was also vice chairman of Edelman, a global public\nrelations firm, where his work included leading Wal-Mart\u2019s\ncorporate social responsibility division. He has been a special\nassistant to the chairman of the U.S. Senate Agriculture\nCommittee and sits on the World Resources Institute board.  \u201cLeslie has played a pivotal role in helping us understand\nthe broader role Wal-Mart can play in meeting the major\nchallenges facing society today, and social goals are now an\nintegral part of how we run our business,\u201d Duke said in the\nmemo. He cited Dach\u2019s work in the areas of hunger, nutrition and\nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment.  Dach was unavailable for comment, Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-\nMart spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Dach\u2019s is the second executive-level departure to be\nannounced in as many weeks. Tom Mars, executive vice president\nand chief administrative officer for Wal-Mart U.S., will leave\nMarch 13 after 11 years with the company.  Corporate Image  Dach led efforts to improve Wal-Mart\u2019s corporate image\nthrough environmental and anti-obesity initiatives and others\naimed at making the company seem \u201cmore worker- and women-\nfriendly,\u201d Faye Landes, an analyst at New York-based Cowen\nGroup Inc., said in a note.  Dach was a frequent participant at analyst meetings, where\n\u201che convincingly documented the company\u2019s improved standing in\nconsumers\u2019 eyes,\u201d Landes said in the note.
