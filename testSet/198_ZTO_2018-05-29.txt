They said they expect the deal to close in June.\nThe investment would be Alibaba\u2019s third in a Chinese courier after buying a minority stakes in YTO Express Group Co Ltd and Best Inc.\nThe e-commerce firm has been expanding its logistics network at home and abroad as it works to diversify its customer base. As part of that effort, it became majority shareholder in September of Cainiao, which provides logistics support to Alibaba\u2019s main e-commerce platform, Taobao.\nZTO owns 1 percent of Cainiao, which it co-founded with Alibaba and over a dozen other Chinese companies in 2013.\nZTO\u2019s chairman, Lai Meisong, told Reuters the latest deal would allow ZTO and Alibaba to better share resources and help ZTO cut costs through access to new technologies. He said the pair decided to enter a deal so as to work more closely on operations and build trust between affiliates.\nA sign of Alibaba Group is seen during the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, December 3, 2017.
