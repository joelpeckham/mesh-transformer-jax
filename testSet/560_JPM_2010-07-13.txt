Novellus rose 5.8 percent. ADC Telecommunications\nInc. jumped 41 percent after agreeing to be bought. All 10\nindustry groups in the S&P 500 advanced, led by financial firms.  \n The  S&P 500  climbed 1.5 percent to 1,095.34 as of 4 p.m. in\nNew York as all but 25 of its companies rose. The index closed \nhigher for a sixth straight day for the first time since April. \nThe  Dow  rallied 146.75 points, or 1.4 percent, to 10,363.02. \nBoth gauges closed at the highest levels since June 21.  \n \u201cYou basically had companies report not just good\nquarters, but good guidance,\u201d said  Eric Green , director of\nresearch at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia, which\noversees $5 billion. \u201cNot much caution about the future, which\nis what everybody had feared the last several weeks.\u201d  \n All four S&P 500 companies that reported results from the\nmarket\u2019s close yesterday through the start of trading this\nmorning topped the average analyst estimate for per-share profit\nin Bloomberg surveys.

It forecast third-\nquarter revenue above the average estimate. Intel is among 23\ncompanies in the index to announce results this week. The shares\ngained 5.2 percent to $22.10 in after-hours trading.  \n  Profits  for S&P 500 companies are projected to have\nincreased 34 percent in the second quarter and by the same\namount in 2010, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by\nBloomberg.   \n \u201cEveryone\u2019s already looking for a very good second quarter\nin terms of earnings season,\u201d said  Kevin Bannon , chief\ninvestment officer at Highmount Capital LLC in New York, which\nmanages $1.8 billion. \u201cTo help push the market forward is going\nto be a function of what managements say about the outlook.\u201d  \n Greek Borrowing  \n U.S. stock futures rallied before the start of trading as\nGreece sold 1.63 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of 26-week\nTreasury bills at a rate below the 5 percent charged by the\nEuropean Union for its bailout package, easing concern the\nnation faces punitive costs to borrow.  \n U.S. stocks rose yesterday, adding to gains from the\n biggest weekly rally  in a year for the S&P 500, as analyst\nupgrades of technology companies boosted optimism before the\nstart of the earnings season.

The deficit was projected to narrow\nto $39 billion, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg\nNews survey.  \n  Alcoa , the largest U.S. aluminum producer, gained 1.2\npercent to $11. The company said after trading hours yesterday\nthat rising sales of aluminum for packaging and commercial\ntransportation helped it report per-share  earnings  of 13 cents,\nexceeding the 11-cent average estimate of 17 analysts surveyed\nby Bloomberg. Global aluminum consumption will gain 12 percent\nthis year, compared with the company\u2019s previous forecast of 10\npercent, Alcoa said.  \n Materials Companies  \n Materials companies in the S&P 500 rose 2.2 percent as a\ngroup, and the financial, consumer discretionary, industrial,\ntechnology and energy groups also rose at least 1.2 percent.  \n Chevron Corp.  led gains in energy companies, rising 1.9\npercent to $73.23.
