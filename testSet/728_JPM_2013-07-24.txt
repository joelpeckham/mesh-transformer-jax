 "context": "The following article called 'China Coal-Fired Economy Dying of Thirst as Mines Lack Water' was published on 2013-07-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAt first glance, Daliuta in northern\n China  appears to have a river running through it. A closer look\nreveals the stretch of water in the center is a pond, dammed at\nboth ends. Beyond the barriers, the Wulanmulun\u2019s bed is dry.  Daliuta in Shaanxi province sits on top of the world\u2019s\nbiggest underground coal mine, which requires millions of liters\nof water a day for extracting, washing and processing the fuel.\nThe town is the epicenter of a looming collision between China\u2019s\nincreasingly scarce supplies of water and its plan to power\neconomic growth with coal.  \u201cWater shortages will severely limit thermal power\ncapacity additions,\u201d said Charles Yonts, head of sustainable\nresearch at brokerage CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in Hong Kong.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t reconcile targets for coal production in, say,\nShanxi province and Inner Mongolia with their water targets.\u201d  Coal industries and power stations use as much as 17\npercent of China\u2019s water, and almost all of the collieries are\nin the vast energy basin in the north that is also one of the\ncountry\u2019s driest regions. By 2020 the government plans to boost\ncoal-fired power by twice the total generating capacity of  India .  About half of China\u2019s rivers have dried up since 1990 and\nthose that remain are mostly contaminated. Without enough water,\ncoal can\u2019t be mined, new power stations can\u2019t run and the\neconomy can\u2019t grow. At least 80 percent of the nation\u2019s coal\ncomes from regions where the United Nations says water supplies\nare either \u201cstressed\u201d or in \u201cabsolute scarcity.\u201d  Desert State  China has about 1,730 cubic meters of fresh water per\nperson, close to the 1,700 cubic meter-level the UN deems\n\u201cstressed.\u201d The situation is worse in the north, where half\nChina\u2019s people, most of its coal and only 20 percent of its\nwater are located.  Shanxi -- the nation\u2019s biggest coal base, with about 28\npercent of production -- has per capita water resources of 347\ncubic meters, less than the Middle Eastern nation of Oman. Inner\nMongolia and Shaanxi, which together contribute 40 percent of\ncoal output, have less than 1,700 cubic meters per person.  A government plan to boost the coal industry and build more\npower plants near mines will lift industrial demand for water in\nInner Mongolia 141 percent by 2015 from 2010, causing aquifers\nto dry up and deserts to expand, according to Greenpeace and the\nChinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Geographical Sciences\nand Natural Resources. About 28,000 rivers have vanished since\n1990, according to the Ministry of Water Resources and National\nBureau of Statistics.  Ordos Wells  \u201cAfter five years there won\u2019t be enough water in Ordos in\nInner Mongolia,\u201d said Sun Qingwei, director of the climate and\nenergy campaign at Greenpeace in Beijing. \u201cThe mines are\nstealing ground water from agriculture. Local governments want\ntheir economies to boom.\u201d  Wells drilled near Haolebaoji near Ordos by Shenhua Group,\nthe world\u2019s biggest coal producer, have caused groundwater\nlevels to drop to a depth of as much as 100 meters, drying out\nthe region\u2019s artesian wells, Greenpeace said in a report\nyesterday. Two calls to Shenhua weren\u2019t answered.  The water that does exist is mostly polluted. A government\nsurvey published in February shows that only about a quarter of\nthe groundwater in the North China Plain -- an area that\u2019s\nbigger than  Greece  and includes Beijing and Tianjin, the\nprovince of Hebei and parts of Henan and Shandong -- is fit for\nhuman consumption.  Severe Pollution  Severe water pollution affects 75 percent of China\u2019s rivers\nand lakes and 28 percent are unsuitable even for agricultural\nuse, according to the 2012 book \u201cChina\u2019s Environmental\nChallenges,\u201d by Judith Shapiro, director of the Masters program\nin Natural Resources and Sustainable Development at the School\nof International Service at American University in  Washington .  Geneva-based Pictet Asset Management\u2019s $3.17 billion global\n water fund  doubled its exposure to stocks offering water\nservices in China to 10 percent since 2007. For Zurich-based\nRobecoSAM\u2019s 611 million-euro Sustainable Water fund, \u201c emerging\nmarkets  offers the best opportunities in the world for water\ninvestments and China is the standout.\u201d  Water-treatment companies  Beijing Enterprises Water Group\nLtd. (371)  and  China Everbright (165)  International Ltd., which Pictet\ninvested in in 2009, are among its best performers this year,\npartly on prospects for stricter environmental regulation in\nChina, said Geneva-based portfolio manager Arnaud Bisschop.  Beijing Enterprises has risen 55 percent this year to\nHK$3.10 and Deutsche Bank sees it reaching HK$3.20 within a year.\nChina Everbright is up 83 percent to HK$7.18 and JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. estimates it will reach HK$7.60 by mid-October.  \u2018Utmost Urgency\u2019  \u201cThe best opportunity is in industrial water re-use, and\nfor the mining industry, it is of the utmost urgency,\u201d said\nJunwei Hafner-Cai, a manager of RobecoSAM\u2019s Sustainable Water\nfund. \u201cWater that has been released from the coal mines and\nfrom petrochemical plants has resulted in severe pollution on\ntop of the water scarcity.\u201d  A shortage of coal because of the lack of water to mine and\nprocess the fuel may force China to increase imports, pushing up\nworld prices, according to Debra Tan, director at research firm\nChina Water Risk in Hong Kong. China, which mines 45 percent of\nthe world\u2019s coal, may adopt an aggressive \u201ccoal-mine grab\u201d to\nsecure supplies, said Tan.  Chinese demand will account for 25 percent of global coal\nimports by 2015, London-based shipbroker ACM Shipping Group Plc\nsaid in a report in April.  Indonesia  is the largest overseas\nsupplier of power-station coal to China, which buys as much as\n45 percent of the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s exports of the fuel.  China is responding with harsher limits on water usage, a\nnew tariff structure that allows for steep price gains, and\nplans to spend 4 trillion  yuan  ($652 billion) by 2020 to boost\nwater infrastructure and resources.  Water Caps  Caps introduced in January limit the annual increase of\nwater used by the four biggest coal-producing regions to 2.9\npercent annually until 2015, while their combined coal output is\nset to increase almost 5 percent a year, according to CLSA.  Water shortages mean \u201cindustrial plants are more and more\nunder pressure,\u201d said Guillaume Dourdin, Beijing-based head of\nthe North-West China region for  France \u2019s Veolia Water, which\ntreated 1.2 billion tons of waste water in China last year. \u201cIn\nsome places we can see it is a constraint for industry. We don\u2019t\nsee a water war in China but obviously there are some tensions\non the resource in some parts.\u201d Veolia Water, a unit of  Veolia\nEnvironnement SA (VIE) , Europe\u2019s biggest water company, has more than\n13,000 employees in China.  Truck Queue  In Daliuta, the mine is \u201csucking up the groundwater,\u201d\nsaid Sun at Greenpeace. Trains hundreds of cars long rumble\nalong elevated tracks through the town center, hauling coal. On\nthe highway to Yulin, trucks carrying the fuel queue nose-to-tail for more than five kilometers to pass through toll booths.  Daliuta\u2019s coal output surged 26 percent last year to 29.4\nbillion tons, according to owner  China Shenhua Energy Co. (1088) , the\nnation\u2019s biggest coal producer.  The town\u2019s river-turned-pond was dammed about six years ago\nto beautify the area for new apartment blocks along the banks,\nsaid Zhe Mancang, who owns a liquor store nearby. The artificial\nlake is now contaminated with waste water from the mines.  \u201cI worry about the water,\u201d said Zhe, 58. \u201cBut I\u2019ve no\nchoice. My family\u2019s here and my customers are from the mines.\u201d  The effect of water shortages extends beyond the north. New\nrules this year require the manufacturing hubs of Jiangsu and\nGuangdong provinces and  Shanghai  to reduce water use every year\neven as their economies expand. Nationwide growth in usage is\ncapped at 1 percent annually.  Water Prices  In the city of Guangzhou water prices rose 50 percent for\nresidents and 89 percent for industrial users in May 2012 to\nhelp pay for improvements to quality and supply, according to an\nApril report by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Stricter controls will raise the risk of investment in\nwater-intensive industries and heavy polluters including coal,\nmetals and paper production, especially in the north, said Tan.  \u201cIn an absolute worst case you\u2019d see a large-scale shift\nin economic activity and population further south for lack of\nwater, and manufacturing increasingly moving abroad,\u201d said\nScott Moore, a research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s\nSustainability Science Program in Cambridge,  Massachusetts .  To alleviate the shortage in the north, the central\ngovernment in 2002 approved the 500 billion yuan South-to-North\nwater diversion project, the largest irrigation project in the\nworld. The plan is to carry 44.8 billion cubic meters of water\nfrom the Yangtze river along three routes.  Tianjin Canal  The 1,467-kilometer-long eastern canal to Tianjin is\nscheduled for completion at the end of this year. The central\nroute to Beijing, more than 1,270 kilometers, is slated to open\nnext year. The western route is still being planned.  Even this massive program may not be enough. The Asian\nDevelopment Bank said in a report last year that China\u2019s demand\nfor water may exceed supply by as much as 200 billion cubic\nmeters by 2030, according to some estimates, unless \u201cmajor\ncapital investments to strengthen water supplies are made beyond\nthose presently planned.\u201d  More efficient use would help. Chinese industry uses four\nto 10 times more water per unit of production than the average\nin developed countries, Tan wrote in a February report. Only 40\npercent of industrial water is recycled, compared with 75\npercent to 85 percent in developed countries, the World Bank\nsays.  Yellow River  China has had some success. In the late 1990s, so much\nwater was being taken from the Yellow River, the nation\u2019s\nsecond-longest waterway, that it dried up before reaching the\nsea for as much as 226 days consecutively. After quotas\ncontrolled by electronic sluice gates were implemented, the\namount of water needed to generate 10,000 yuan of GDP fell to\n308 cubic meters in 2006, from 1,672 cubic meters in 1990,\naccording to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.  China\u2019s efforts to expand alternative energy, including\ninvesting $65.1 billion in clean energies like solar and wind\npower in 2012, aren\u2019t enough to match rising demand. The\nnation\u2019s dependence on thermal power generation, including gas\nand oil, will decline by just three percentage points to 76\npercent by 2030, Bloomberg New Energy Finance analysts Maxime\nSerrano Bardisa and Alasdair Wilson wrote in a February report.  Among the biggest losers are farmers, who have to dig\ndeeper and deeper wells to find clean water, or are forced out\nby local governments who see bigger economic gains from mining.  In Zhanggaijie village, 90 minutes from Yulin city in\nShaanxi, Li Qiaoling\u2019s corn harvest slumped to 2 to 3 tons per\nmu (667 square meters) from 4 to 5 tons four years ago, she said.\nLi, 43, had to deepen her well to 60 meters from about 30 meters\nfive years ago, she said.  Relocation Wait  Now she waits with about 200 villagers for compensation and\nnews from local officials on where they will be relocated after\ncoal mining polluted the local water supply, said Li.  \u201cWe\u2019re angry because we have to leave,\u201d said Li, who\nstill farms and sells produce from her 11 mu plot, despite the\ncontamination. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about moving to a strange\nplace.\u201d  Premier Li Keqiang vowed at a March press briefing to crack\ndown on pollution. \u201cBeing rich and well-off isn\u2019t OK either if\nthe environment deteriorates,\u201d Li said.  Implementing such promises has proved elusive. In April, a\ngroup of 60 officials from the Ministry of Environmental\nProtection told Zhang Haibin, an associate professor at Peking\nUniversity, that they \u201cdon\u2019t dare to really monitor\u201d pollution\nbecause it would affect growth, Zhang said at a forum. The\nofficials said when \u201ceconomic growth conflicts, environmental\ntargets always give way,\u201d Zhang said.  A manufacturing report today from HSBC Holdings Plc and\nMarkit Economics only highlighted that pressure, pointing to a\ndeeper slowdown this month in the Chinese economy.
