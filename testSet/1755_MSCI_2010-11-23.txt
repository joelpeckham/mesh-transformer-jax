The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCopper fell for a second day in New\nYork on concern demand may weaken as China, the world\u2019s biggest\nconsumer of the metal, moves to cool inflation.  China\u2019s largest banks are near reaching annual lending\nquotas and plan to stop expanding loan books, according to four\npeople with knowledge of the matter. The country\u2019s benchmark\nmoney-market rate rose on speculation borrowing costs will\nclimb. Copper also dropped as the dollar gained and equities\nretreated after North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire.  \u201cMarket rumors that China will indeed raise its rates this\nweek are keeping prices under pressure,\u201d  Alex Heath , head of\nindustrial-metals trading at Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd. in\nLondon, said in a report.  Copper for March delivery fell 6.7 cents, or 1.8 percent,\nto $3.695 a pound at 8:06 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Copper\nfor delivery in three months dropped 2.1 percent to $8,119 a\nmetric ton on the London Metal Exchange. All of the six main\nmetals traded on the LME slid.  \u201cThe impact of policy tightening and the sale of\ncommodities from strategic state stockpiles could potentially\nhave a more significant impact on underlying commodity\nmarkets,\u201d  Nick Moore  and  Daniel Major , analysts at RBS Global\nBanking & Markets in London, said of China in a report today.  Jets Scramble  South Korea returned fire and scrambled fighter jets after\nNorth Korean artillery killed two soldiers. The U.S. Dollar\nIndex, a six-currency gauge of the greenback\u2019s strength, added\nas much as 0.6 percent, making dollar-priced metals more\nexpensive in terms of other monies. The MSCI World Index of\nshares dropped as much as 0.7 percent.  \u201cThe Korea news is only likely to contribute to a broader\ntheme of risk aversion,\u201d Major said by e-mail.  Chinese regulators are monitoring banks\u2019 loan balances to\nensure an official 2010 target for new lending isn\u2019t exceeded,\nthe people said. The government in the past month stepped up a\ncampaign to limit credit expansion after inflation quickened and\nproperty prices surged. Imports of copper into the country slid\nto a one-year low, figures showed yesterday.  \u201cAdditional supply as a result of sustained sales of\nChinese base-metal stockpiles has the potential to weigh on\nprices in the coming months,\u201d Moore and Major said.  European Manufacturing  A report showing that growth in Europe\u2019s services and\nmanufacturing industries unexpectedly accelerated in November\nhelped prices to rebound from the day\u2019s lowest levels. A\ncomposite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing\nmanagers in both industries advanced to 55.4, Markit Economics\nsaid. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Figures due at 10 a.m. New York time may show lower sales\nof existing houses in the U.S., the world\u2019s second-biggest\ncopper user. Construction accounts for a quarter of copper\ndemand, according to the Copper Development Association.\nPurchases fell to a 4.48 million annual rate in October,\naccording to the median of 71 estimates in a Bloomberg News\nsurvey.  Anglo American Plc and Xstrata Plc will have to resume wage\ntalks after most workers reject a pay offer, according to the\nunion representing strikers at the Collahuasi mine in Chile, the\nworld\u2019s fourth-biggest. The stoppage is in its third week. A\nwage proposal was accepted yesterday by 170 of 1,551 workers,\ncompany spokeswoman Bernardita Fernandez said today by e-mail.  Higher Premium  Immediate-delivery LME copper\u2019s premium to the three-month\ncontract jumped 52 percent to $35 a ton today. Prices moved on\nNov. 8 to a so-called backwardation, when nearby metal trades\nabove longer-dated contracts, potentially indicating concern\nabout near-term supply.  Orders to draw copper from LME stockpiles, or canceled\nwarrants, gained 1.8 percent to 32,325 tons, daily exchange\nfigures showed. Copper inventories fell 0.3 percent to 358,050\ntons.
