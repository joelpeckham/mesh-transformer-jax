 "context": "The following article called 'Cash Hoards Reduce Bond Sales to Least Since \u201906: Credit Markets' was published on 2012-04-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGlobal corporate bond issuance is\npoised for the slowest April in six years as companies reduce\ntheir reliance on debt markets while sitting on cash reserves\nthat are about the highest on record.  Company bond sales worldwide have declined 53 percent to\n$190 billion through yesterday, the least for an April since\n2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The slowdown\nfollows a record $1.17 trillion of deals in the first quarter,\nwhen strains from  Europe \u2019s debt crisis eased and companies\nborrowed at interest rates that approached the lowest ever.  Bank of America Corp.  and Morgan Stanley followed\nFairfield, Connecticut-based General Electric Co. in plans to\ncut bond offerings as net debt falls at the two banks.\nCorporations have been repairing balance sheets and increasing\ncash reserves as a gradually improving global economy helps\ncompanies recover from the biggest financial crisis since the\nGreat Depression.  \u201cA lot of companies have a tremendous amount of cash at\nhand to run the normal course of operations, and the ones that\nneeded to tap the market have already done so,\u201d Jody Lurie, a\ncorporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in\nPhiladelphia, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe only need to\ntap the market right now is for shareholder rewards or\nacquisitions.\u201d  \u2018Flush With Cash\u2019  The ratio of cash to total assets for companies in the\n Standard & Poor\u2019s  500 Index has held at about 10 percent after\nreaching a record 10.3 percent in September, Bloomberg compiled\ndata show. The ratio is up from 5.6 percent in April 2007. Net\ndebt dropped to 2.2 times earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization at the end of March. The figure\nwas at 5.1 times before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings\nInc. in September 2008, Bloomberg data show.  \u201cCompanies are flush with cash and have already termed out\ntheir liquidity,\u201d said  Ashish Shah , head of global credit\ninvestments at AllianceBernstein LP in  New York . Given the\nstrong demand in the first quarter, \u201ccompanies were happy to\nissue into that given low rates,\u201d which fell to as low as 4.12\npercent in March, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s\nGlobal Broad Market Corporate & High Yield Index.  Elsewhere in credit markets,  Molson Coors  Brewing Co.\nissued $1.9 billion of bonds to help pay for its intended\nacquisition of StarBev LP of Prague. The Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York said it sold $7.5 billion of collateralized debt\nobligations linked to commercial mortgages to  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and\nDeutsche Bank AG. Chemicals-maker Ineos Group Holdings Ltd.\nincreased the size of a loan to $3.025 billion.  Swap Spreads Rise  The U.S. two-year  interest-rate  swap spread, a measure of\ndebt market stress, rose for the first time in three days,\nincreasing 1.3 basis points to 30.31 basis points. The gauge,\nwhich has climbed from 23.50 on March 28, the lowest level since\nAugust, widens when investors seek the perceived safety of\n government securities  and narrows when they favor assets such as\ncorporate bonds.  The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default in the\nU.S. fell for a third day to a three-week low.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of\ncredit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against\nlosses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,\ndeclined 1.4 basis points to a mid-price of 96.2 basis points,\naccording to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge has dropped\nfrom 104.3 on April 10, the highest level since Jan. 20.  GE Bonds  The  Markit iTraxx Europe Index  of 125 companies with\ninvestment-grade ratings increased 1.5 to 144 at 10 a.m. in\n London . The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index jumped 4 to 183.  The indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves\nand rise as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the buyer face\nvalue if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the\nvalue of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000\nannually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Bonds of  General Electric (GE)  were the most actively traded\ndollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers yesterday,\nwith 168 trades of $1 million or more, according to Trace, the\nbond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory\nAuthority. The world\u2019s largest jet-engine maker sold $700\nmillion of debt on April 25 after issuing $3.1 billion of debt\nthe previous day.  Molson Coors  Molson Coors sold $300 million of five-year, 2 percent\nnotes that yield 125 basis points more than Treasuries, $500\nmillion of 10-year, 3.5 percent securities at a 160-basis point\nspread and $1.1 billion of 5 percent, 30-year notes at a 190-\nbasis point premium, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nStandard & Poor\u2019s rated the debt BBB-, one level above junk.  The beer producer is turning to the dollar-denominated  bond\nmarket  for the first time since 2007 to help fund the $3.5\nbillion StarBev purchase, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. Montreal- and Denver-based Molson Coors may lose its\ninvestment-grade ratings unless it improves its financial\nprofile after the deal, S&P said in a note on April 3.  Three teams of Wall Street firms were competing for the\nFed\u2019s commercial-mortgage debt, which was assumed in the 2008\nbailout of  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , according to\npeople familiar with the transaction. Citigroup Inc., Credit\nSuisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. also joined forces,\nas did  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , Morgan Stanley and Nomura Holdings\nInc.  Ineos Loan  The  Standard & Poor\u2019s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index \nrose for a fourth day to the highest level since March 30. The\nmeasure tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien\nleveraged loans and has returned 4.8 percent this year.  Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3\nby Moody\u2019s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by S&P.  The loan for Ineos, a Swiss chemicals producer, is a\ncovenant-lite deal, which don\u2019t carry typical lender protection\nsuch as financial maintenance requirements, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Barclays and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  are arranging the debt,\nwhich includes a $2 billion portion and a $650 million euro-\ndenominated slice, both due in six years, and a $375 million\nfacility maturing in three years, according to a person with\nknowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified because\nthe deal is private.  In  emerging markets , relative yields rose for the first\ntime in three days, increasing 1 basis point to 353 basis\npoints, or 3.53 percentage points, according to  JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI\nGlobal index . The measure has averaged 373 basis points this\nyear.  \u2018Engraved in Stone\u2019  Global corporate bond sales this year of $1.36 trillion\nthrough yesterday are outpacing the $1.3 trillion from the same\nperiod last year, Bloomberg data show. Issuance this month is\nthe least since the $184.3 billion sold in April 2006.  Corporate bond offerings tend to be slower in April\ncompared with the first three months of the year as companies\ndelay issuance plans before reporting quarterly earnings.  \u201cThe typical pattern for this time of the year is pretty\nmuch engraved in stone,\u201d Marc Pinto, head of corporate bond\nstrategy at New York-based Susquehanna International Group,\nwrote in an e-mail. \u201cRelease earnings, issue bonds, repeat.\nIt\u2019s just not happening this quarter.\u201d  Financial companies are reducing debt offerings as they\nshift to businesses that require less capital and as cash\nholdings increase.  GE, BofA Outlook  Morgan Stanley (MS) , which has shifted to a \u201cmore liquid flow-\nfocused business,\u201d didn\u2019t refinance a majority of its $16\nbillion of debt that matured or was retired in the first\nquarter, the bank\u2019s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, said in\nan April 19 conference call.  Bank of America, which sold about $6 billion of debt in the\nfirst quarter, according to Bloomberg data, expects to offer\nless than $5 billion for the remainder of the year as its excess\nliquidity sources soared to a record $406 billion at the end of\nMarch, Chief Financial Officer Bruce R. Thompson said in a\nconference call last week.  GE, the leading U.S. corporate issuer in 2011, has sold\n$17.3 billion of debt this year compared with $18.6 billion in\nthe same period last year. Its GE Capital finance unit expects\nto have \u201clower debt issuances\u201d in 2012, Chief Executive\nOfficer  Jeffrey Immelt  said in January.  Bond sales breached records in the first quarter as\nEurope\u2019s debt strains eased and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben\nBernanke  said March 13 he was holding to his plan of keeping the\nbenchmark interest rate close to zero through at least 2014.  The world economy will grow by 3.5 percent this year, the\nWashington-based  International Monetary Fund  said April 17 in\nits World Economic Outlook, boosting its forecast from 3.3\npercent in January.  Appetites Tempered  \u201cGiven the stronger market tone earlier in the year and\nall in-yields that were near record lows, some companies front-\nloaded their issuance in the first part of the year, which helps\nexplain the current slowdown in primary market activity,\u201d\nBarclays credit strategist Alex Gennis said in a telephone\ninterview.  Investor appetites also have been tempered by a broader\nselloff starting earlier this month as Europe\u2019s sovereign debt\ncrisis flared again and as economic reports fell short of\nexpectations, said Hans Mikkelsen, a high grade credit\nstrategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Spain\u2019s sovereign credit rating was cut to BBB+ from A by\nStandard & Poor\u2019s yesterday on concern the nation will have to\nprovide further fiscal support to the banking sector.  Orders for U.S.  durable goods  fell 4.2 percent in March,\nthe most in three years, and March new  home sales  fell 7.1\npercent to 328,000 annual rate, figures this week showed.  \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a risk-off moment for the market, which\ntends to lead to less supply as well,\u201d Mikkelsen said in a\ntelephone interview.  While issuance will pick up from companies needing to tap\nthe market to fund acquisitions, it probably won\u2019t revive sales\nto the pace set in the first quarter, Janney\u2019s Lurie said.  \u201cCompanies are shifting away from  capital markets  to\nfinance their balance sheet,\u201d she said.
