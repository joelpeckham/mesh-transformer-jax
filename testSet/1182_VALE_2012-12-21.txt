 "context": "The following article called 'ArcelorMittal Reports $4.3 Billion Writedown of Europe Unit' was published on 2012-12-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nArcelorMittal (MT) , the world\u2019s biggest\nsteelmaker, will write down the goodwill in its European\nbusinesses by about $4.3 billion as the region\u2019s weakening\neconomy erodes demand and leaves producers with excess capacity.  The writedown will take the form of a non-cash impairment\ncharge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Luxembourg-\nbased company said today in a statement. Steel consumption in\n Europe  has dropped by about 8 percent this year, it said.  \u201cThe outlook remains challenging,\u201d said  Tim Cahill , an\nanalyst at J&E Davy Holdings Ltd. in Dublin. \u201cThe disappointing\nthing is that this announcement does not include further plant\nshutdowns. The only real solution to the structural problems in\nthe European steel market will be further plant closures.\u201d  ArcelorMittal is among European steelmakers grappling with\nhow to shutter unneeded furnaces, whose output is weighing on\nprices. The region can produce about 210 million metric tons of\nsteel a year, while demand in a \u201cnormal market\u201d is 150 million\nto 160 million tons, according to industry lobby group Eurofer.  Steel-industry earnings have slumped as Europe\u2019s economic\ncrisis saps demand and slower Chinese growth weighs on commodity\nprices. ArcelorMittal reported the lowest quarterly profit in\nalmost three years in October and is moving output to cheaper\nlocations and idling plants. India\u2019s  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  said Nov.\n23 it was cutting 900 jobs and closing 12 sites in the U.K.  Stock Slumps  ArcelorMittal fell 2.5 percent to 12.88 euros by the close\nin Amsterdam trading, the biggest decline in  seven weeks . The\nbenchmark Amsterdam Exchanges Index dropped 0.7 percent.  The \u201cweaker demand environment, and expectations that it\nwill persist over the near and medium term, led to a downward\nrevision of cash-flow expectations underlying the valuation of\nthe European businesses to which goodwill has been allocated,\u201d\nArcelorMittal said.  When companies make an acquisition, the difference between\nthe value of the target\u2019s hard assets and the purchase price is\nknown as goodwill. That gets carried on the company\u2019s balance\nsheet as an asset and is reviewed periodically by public\ncompanies.  ArcelorMittal\u2019s  net debt  and earnings before interest, tax,\ndepreciation and amortization, as well as compliance with debt\ncovenants, are unaffected by the impairment, it said.  Vale SA (VALE) , the world\u2019s largest iron-ore producer, said\nyesterday it will book a $4.2 billion charge that includes a\nreduced valuation on its 22 percent stake in aluminum producer\n Norsk Hydro ASA. (NHY)  The Brazilian company cited \u201cmacroeconomic\nuncertainties\u201d confronting Europe.  In  Germany , steelmaker  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  took a 3.6 billion-\neuro ($4.8 billion) writedown on its Americas unit on Dec. 11.  ArcelorMittal today had its debt rating cut to BB+ from\nBBB- by Fitch Ratings, which cited a \u201cmore challenging than\npreviously expected outlook for western European steel markets\nin 2013.\u201d The downgrade follows a move by  Standard & Poor\u2019s  to\nlower ArcelorMittal\u2019s rating to junk on Aug. 2 and a cut by\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service on Nov. 8.
