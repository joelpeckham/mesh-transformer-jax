 "context": "The following article called 'San Francisco Leasing Slows Amid Office Boom: Real Estate' was published on 2013-05-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLeasing by San Francisco-area technology firms is slowing just as developers are poised to add 6.5 million square feet of office space to the city and Silicon Valley, the most construction in a dozen years.  Twenty-six projects are under way, from glass towers in downtown  San Francisco (ROFFSFRV)  to suburban office parks in Sunnyvale and  Santa Clara ,  California , according to brokerage CBRE Group Inc. About 3.4 million square feet (316,000 square meters) of the new development, or more than half, is speculative, meaning landlords broke ground without signing tenants, CBRE data show.  The building boom comes after three years of expansion by companies including Google Inc., Apple Inc. and  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  spurred a surge in rents, making San Francisco the top U.S. office market in 2012 based on forecasts for future increases, according to Green Street Advisors Inc. Growth has cooled, with leasing down 43 percent in the city and two quarters of occupancy losses in Silicon Valley in the past year, raising the prospect that tenants won\u2019t be easy to find at higher rates.  \u201cCompanies decided to lock up space before rents climbed further, so they accelerated their normal leasing,\u201d said Donald Wise, chief executive officer of Metzler Realty Advisors Inc., a Seattle-based investor whose $445 million purchase of an  office tower  in  San Francisco \u2019s South of Market district was the city\u2019s priciest deal per square foot in 2012. \u201cDemand is now muted.\u201d  Newly occupied space in San Francisco totaled 80,850 square feet in the first quarter, down from a quarterly average of 118,000 square feet in the trailing 12 months and 526,000 square feet in 2011, according to data from Los Angeles-based CBRE. In Silicon Valley, roughly the area between San Francisco and  San Jose  about 45 miles south in Santa Clara County, occupancy tumbled by a net 94,000 square feet from the fourth quarter, with the vacancy rate rising to 11.4 percent from 11.2 percent.  Luring Talent  Some software, social-media and mobile-application firms have rented too much space for their current needs, said Steve Barker, San Francisco branch manager for Studley Inc., a tenant brokerage. Large firms are assessing global markets for mobile devices, online services and cloud storage on the Internet before signing more leases, while smaller companies take longer to consider deals as landlords raise rates to see what tenants will bear, said Todd Shaffer, managing director in Santa Clara for broker Cornish & Carey Commercial Newmark Knight Frank.  \u201cPeople are getting all worried, but it\u2019s a good sign that they\u2019re thinking things through,\u201d said Shaffer, referring to office renters. \u201cI\u2019ll be concerned if we\u2019re having this conversation at the end of the third quarter.\u201d  Cost Increase  San Francisco\u2019s leasing boom drove up costs for the most desirable  office space  -- including rent, local taxes and service charges -- by 36 percent in the year through September, the biggest jump among 133 global markets, CBRE said. Technology firms accounted for more than half of all deals, with San Francisco-based  Salesforce.com (CRM) , the biggest provider of online customer-management software, leasing 1.3 million square feet, the most by one company in a year since at least 2000, the brokerage said.  Asking rents in San Francisco rose 18 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to $50.79 a square foot, the 12th straight gain, and in Silicon Valley they climbed 7.9 percent to $37.68, the highest since 2001\u2019s third quarter, CBRE said.  During the recession, rents bottomed in San Francisco at $30.50 a square foot, and vacancy peaked at 16.2 percent, in the first quarter of 2010, according to CBRE. Silicon Valley rates hit a low of $27.71 a square foot in the third quarter of 2010, with vacancy peaking at 21 percent a year earlier.  \u2018Fifth Inning\u2019  Across the country, office leasing in central business districts fell 5.3 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, and vacancies were little changed at 13 percent, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.  San Francisco\u2019s office market is now in the \u201cfifth inning\u201d of a nine-inning recovery, with \u201cdecelerating\u201d growth that\u2019s dropped its five-year outlook for rent increases to second in the U.S. based on revenue per square foot,  Michael Knott , managing director of  Newport Beach , California-based research firm Green Street, wrote in an e-mail.  West Los Angeles (MODCMMAP)  is the top office market based on forecasted rent growth through 2017, he said.  The current development wave, the most since 9.1 million square feet were added in 2001, include speculative projects in San Francisco such as Tishman Speyer Properties LP\u2019s  Foundry Square III , with large floors that \u201ccreate a sense of voluminous space illuminated by floor-to-ceiling glass,\u201d and a tower by Boston Properties Inc., at 535 Mission St., with \u201cexcellent natural light\u201d and a \u201cdramatic two-story lobby,\u201d according to the developers.  Corporate Campus  In Silicon Valley, Menlo Equities LLC and Beacon Capital Partners LLC are constructing three buildings at 3333 Scott Boulevard in Santa Clara, which the firms describe as \u201ca traditional Silicon Valley mid-rise corporate campus with ample parking and stand-alone identity.\u201d Jay Paul Co. is developing the second property of a planned six-building  campus  in Sunnyvale, dubbed Technology Corners, with \u201clandscaped plazas, fountains and walkways,\u201d the company said.  San Francisco\u2019s office market has a \u201cgenuine groundswell of demand\u201d that justifies site development and building that\u2019s \u201ca little bit more aggressive,\u201d Boston Properties Chairman  Mort Zuckerman  said on the firm\u2019s May 1 earnings call. Google, Microsoft Corp., Yahoo! Inc. and San Francisco-based startups Square Inc. and AppDynamics are all looking for large blocks of space, said Doug Linde, president of the Boston-based landlord.  Rising Employment  Job growth is still robust, with employment rising for the 33rd straight month in both San Francisco and Silicon Valley. This year through March, 33,000 new jobs were added in the city and 28,900 in the valley, according to California\u2019s Employment Development Department. Two-thirds of professional and business-services positions came from the technology industry, the agency said on April 19.  Companies are willing to pay triple the cost of suburban space to locate in the city because workers prefer an urban environment, said Carl Bass, CEO of Autodesk Inc. The  San Rafael , California-based maker of computer-aided design software signed three leases last year at San Francisco\u2019s One Market and Pier 9 that will almost double its occupancy to 287,000 square feet by mid-2014.  \u201cIf you get better people, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d Bass said in an interview.  Landlords are contending with smaller space needs from tenants across industries, down by almost a third to 170 square feet per employee, on average, said Studley\u2019s Barker. Technology firms in San Francisco need 30,000 more hires to fill space that\u2019s already been leased, he said.  Space Race  \u201cThis tech market has been driven by a race to control contiguous space and pre-empt rising rates,\u201d Barker said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve massively over-leased. It remains to be seen whether they can fill it.\u201d  The rise in San Francisco rents means that offices comparable to those leased at $30 a square foot in early 2012 are now asking $50 a square foot, according to Barker. Spec buildings under construction will require rents of $60 to $70 a square foot at minimum to cover development costs, he said.  Each project has its own financing structure, starting with the price of land, that can dictate success in a fast-moving market, said Henry Bullock, chairman of  Palo Alto , California-based Menlo Equities. Low-rise construction in Silicon Valley, at $375 to $425 a square foot, is cheaper than urban towers in San Francisco, Bullock said. Menlo and Boston-based Beacon Capital will seek rents of $35 a square foot at the Scott Boulevard project in Santa Clara.  \u2018Not Worried\u2019  \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of development as a percentage of the existing inventory, so we\u2019re not worried,\u201d Bullock said in a telephone interview. The  three buildings  will be \u201cshell-ready\u201d by mid-August, with \u201cname-brand companies\u201d in discussions to lease one or all of them, he said.  Among San Francisco spec projects, the  535 Mission St . tower by Boston Properties, the biggest U.S. office real estate investment trust, will cost $700 a square foot, Green Street said in a Feb. 6 note. That\u2019s 15 percent more than Kilroy Realty Corp. is spending to develop nearby 350 Mission St., a high-rise that\u2019s no longer spec after being fully preleased to Salesforce.com.  The Boston Properties investment, with an expected 6 percent yield, \u201cseems just OK\u201d compared with Los Angeles-based Kilroy\u2019s 6.5 percent or more and a guaranteed tenant, Green Street said in its note. \u201cWithout any known preleasing, these economics seem so-so on a risk-adjusted basis,\u201d the firm said.  Spec builders probably believe the potential for profit is greater by \u201cdeveloping to core, rather than buying to core,\u201d said Wise of Metzler Realty, whose acquisition last year on behalf of a German pension worked out to $802 a square foot.  \u201cThere\u2019s strong reason to be optimistic,\u201d Wise said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the market has gotten so overheated that new supply will outstrip reasonable expectations of demand.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Dan Levy in San Francisco at  dlevy13@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kara Wetzel at  kwetzel@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CBRE Group Inc was 24.030000686645508 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CBRE Group Inc was ",
