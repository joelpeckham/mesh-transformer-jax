 "context": "The following article called 'Confidence Measures Show It\u2019s the Politics, Stupid' was published on 2013-09-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmericans\u2019 views of the U.S.\neconomy are increasingly colored by politics, making consumer\nsentiment a less reliable gauge of the outlook for the spending\nthat drives growth.  Self-identified Democrats and Republicans surveyed for the\nBloomberg Comfort Index are showing the least agreement on the\ntrajectory of the economy since records began in 1990. Since\n Barack Obama  took office in 2009, the likelihood that the two\ngroups\u2019 views will move in the same direction is less than half\nwhat it was under George W. Bush, and less than a third of that\nwhen Democrat Bill Clinton was in the White House.  Growing political polarization helps explain the trend,\naccording to analysts such as Steve Jarding at Harvard\nUniversity. As partisan gaps widen on issues from the overhaul\nof health-care policy to restructuring tax brackets, it has\nbecome harder for consumers to separate their political views\nfrom their assessment of the economy. What\u2019s more,\n auto sales  last month were the strongest since November 2007\neven as  consumer confidence  declined in two surveys, showing\nthat less optimism doesn\u2019t always translate into weaker\nspending.  \u201cAmerica for 30 years has been just drowned in information\non polarizing single issues,\u201d said Jarding, a professor at\nHarvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge,\n Massachusetts , and a former Democratic campaign manager. \u201cIt\u2019s\nmore difficult just to gauge the sense of the public\u201d on\neconomic conditions, he said.  As a result, Wall Street analysts say they rely less on\nsuch consumer surveys, including those from the Conference Board\nand Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan as well as the\nBloomberg index, to project changes in household purchases that\nmake up about 70 percent of growth.  Unrelated to Spending  \u201cWe don\u2019t base too much of our forecast on consumer\nsentiment, no matter which measure, because they\u2019re responding\nto things in the news in some sense that are unrelated to\nconsumer spending,\u201d said Daniel Silver, an economist at\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York.  Analysts use the concept of correlation to measure the\nstrength of the relationship between two groups, with zero\nindicating no discernible trend and 1 showing they are moving in\ntandem. The correlation between the confidence of Democrats and\nthat of Republicans is 0.25 since Obama started his first term.\nDuring Bush\u2019s two terms it was 0.55 and under Clinton it was\n0.95, showing consumers of different political persuasions had\njust about the same views on the direction of the economy in\n1993 to 2001.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan  gauge  of\nsentiment plunged 9.8 points in December amid negotiations in\nWashington over tax increases and federal spending cuts.\nConsumer spending increased 0.1 percent that month, \u201cnot a huge\ndrop-off\u201d and illustrating politics may obscure Americans\u2019\nactual purchasing habits, Silver said. The Conference Board\u2019s\nmeasure dropped to a four-month low at the end of last year.  Auto Sales  The Michigan index dropped to a four-month low in August,\nand the Bloomberg comfort gauge has declined four straight weeks\nsince the beginning of last month. Meanwhile, sales of cars and\nlight trucks accelerated to a 16 million annualized pace in\nAugust, according to data from Ward\u2019s Automotive Group.  \u201cConsumers don\u2019t always do what they say, and there are\nmany times when those two things move in opposite directions,\u201d\nsaid Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse in New York.\n\u201cSometimes people will spend to make themselves feel better\nwhen things are bad.\u201d  If respondents were rating the economy as they do their\npocketbooks, the results would be different. Republicans, who\ntend to be more affluent, historically have assigned a higher\ngrade to the economy, said Gary Langer, president of the New\nYork-based Langer Research Associates, which compiles the\nBloomberg index.  Personal Finances  Until the week ended Sept. 1, self-identified Democratic\nvoters had been more confident overall than Republicans for an\nunprecedented 75 straight weeks. Democrats\u2019 views of their\n personal finances  haven\u2019t followed suit, exceeding Republicans\u2019\nin only seven weeks during the same period, according to the\nBloomberg Comfort data.  This has occurred even as Republicans lost ground to\nDemocrats in the higher-income categories since 2008, Gallup\ndata shows.  Among those taking home more than $75,000 a year,\nRepublicans outnumber Democrats by 2.1 percentage points, down\nfrom 4.4 points in 2008, according to Gallup.  At the same time, the Democratic advantage among lower-income voters has narrowed. The difference between the two major\nparties among those making less than $20,000 a year is 18\npercentage points, down from 25 points in 2008.  Even as the value of the headline confidence numbers\ndiminishes, some components of the surveys, such as a gauge of\npersonal finances, can provide stronger hints of economic\ngrowth, Basile said.  Making Forecasts  Maury Harris, the New York-based chief economist for UBS\nSecurities LLC, said he assesses expectations components in the\nMichigan and  Conference Board (CONCCONF)  confidence gauges to make consumer\nspending forecasts. Harris is the top forecaster of the\nConference Board\u2019s headline index for the past two years,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Conference Board\u2019s gauge of present conditions measures\nconsumers\u2019 views of current business and employment health, as\nwell as their outlook for the next six months. The Michigan\nsurvey also includes measures of current conditions, used to\nassess how Americans perceive their financial situation, and\nexpectations.  \u201cConfidence matters, but income\u2019s very important\u201d in\nforecasting consumer spending, Harris said. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly\nanything in what I do that\u2019s a definitive, dominant variable. We\nknow that conceptually confidence has to be important.\u201d  Better Predictor  The  present situation  component of the Conference Board\u2019s\nsurvey is a better predictor for employment data than its\noverall figure, according to New York Federal Reserve research\nthat analyzes data dating back to 1977. That survey component\nshows a 0.89 correlation with the unemployment rate two months\ninto the future.  The proliferation of political surveys, as well as\nquestions within non-political surveys that ask respondents\u2019\naffiliations, tend to \u201cmuddy the water\u201d on data intended to\nshow economic perceptions, said Ken Goldstein of the Conference\nBoard, which does not ask respondents their political\nidentifications for its monthly confidence survey.  Rebecca McBee, a research area specialist for the Michigan\nindex, said in an e-mail that the survey doesn\u2019t ask respondents\nfor their political affiliation. McBee referred questions on\npartisan identification in confidence surveys to Richard Curtin,\nthe survey director. Calls and e-mails to Curtin weren\u2019t\nreturned.  \u2018Hyper-Partisan\u2019  The increasingly \u201chyper-partisan\u201d political landscape has\ncaused consumers to more frequently take cues from voices on\ntelevision who express strong feelings on issues that are then\nabsorbed by viewers who repeat the ideas, a trend that\u2019s\nunlikely to recede anytime soon, said Dan Schnur, director of\nthe Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of\nSouthern California in Los Angeles.  \u201cAs our political leaders retreat further and further away\nfrom midfield into their respective ideological end zones, at a\ncertain point, voters are going to begin to push back, but it\u2019s\nhard to see that pushback happening in the immediate future,\u201d\nand probably not before the 2016 presidential election, said\nSchnur, a former Republican consultant.
