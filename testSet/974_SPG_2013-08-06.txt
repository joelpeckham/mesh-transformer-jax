 "context": "The following article called 'Oyster Bay Slipping as Cash Dries Up in Mall Fight: Muni Credit' was published on 2013-08-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLong Island\u2019s Oyster Bay, New York\u2019s\nsixth-largest bond issuer, is trying to balance its finances\nafter seven years of deficits. A battle between two of the\nbiggest U.S. mall developers may wreck those plans.  The municipality, whose bond yields jumped to a two-year\nhigh last month, has budgeted $17 million from the proposed sale\nof a 54-acre parcel. In May, the town council approved the deal\nwith a buyer backed by  Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the biggest\nU.S. mall real-estate investment trust by market value. The\ncompany is trying to prevent competitor  Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO) \nfrom building a mall on an adjacent site.  Taubman, in turn, is seeking to block the land sale to the\nSimon affiliate and filed petitions forcing an Aug. 20\nreferendum on the deal. If voters reject the Simon-backed plan,\nOyster Bay, with a median household income almost double the\nstate\u2019s, may not have enough cash to pay its bills by Nov. 1,\nsaid Lindsay Wilhelm, a Standard & Poor\u2019s analyst.  \u201cThe town fully expects the referendum to pass,\u201d Wilhelm\nsaid by phone from New York. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll go into\ncrisis mode.\u201d  Rough Ride  Oyster Bay, the former home of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt about 34 miles (55 kilometers) east of New York,\njoined municipalities nationwide in seeing revenue trail\nspending obligations following the 18-month recession that ended\nin 2009. S&P has lowered the town\u2019s grade five levels since\n2011, to A, sixth-highest, and is threatening to do so again\nbecause of deficits exacerbated by the same rising pension\nobligations burdening localities from  California  to New York.  From 2007 to 2011, Oyster Bay\u2019s pension and health-care\nobligations climbed 21 percent, according to data from state\nComptroller Thomas DiNapoli. By contrast, mortgage-tax revenue\nfell by two-thirds, said John Venditto, supervisor of the town,\nwhose 293,000 residents make it bigger than Buffalo, the state\u2019s\nsecond-most-populous city.  The town spans almost 115 square miles and touches both the\nnorth and south shores of Long Island. Its 18 villages, all of\nwhich have independent governments, are still subject to the\ntown\u2019s property taxes. Oyster Bay\u2019s median household income of\nabout $107,000 from 2007 to 2011 compared with the statewide\nlevel of about $57,000.  Debt Drive  To maintain services and continue an infrastructure\noverhaul, Venditto increased Oyster Bay\u2019s debt to $751 million\nin 2011 from $410 million in 2007, making it the state\u2019s fifth-largest issuer other than New York City, according to DiNapoli\u2019s\ndata. Those spending decisions led to S&P\u2019s rating cuts.  The company said July 25 it may lower the town\u2019s credit\ngrade within 90 days if voters block the property sale. Oyster\nBay general-obligation bonds maturing in February 2017 traded\nJuly 31 with an average yield of 1.93 percent, close to the\nhighest since 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The extra\nyield investors demanded on the debt, about 0.92 percentage\npoint, was more than double levels on some trades in May.  Venditto, who opposes the Taubman project because he\ndoesn\u2019t want a mall on the site, said in an interview that he\nhas a plan to maintain cash flow if the sale to the Simon group\nfails, though he declined to provide details.  Investor\u2019s Decision  Howard Cure, who heads municipal research at New York-based\nEvercore Wealth Management LLC, said he\u2019s no longer buying\nOyster Bay debt.  \u201cYou don\u2019t associate multistep downgrades with a township\nof this size and wealth,\u201d said Cure, whose company manages\nabout $4.7 billion. \u201cWhat gets me nervous is when you\u2019re\nrelying on voters to make a fiscal decision.\u201d  In 2012, with the town\u2019s reserves drained, Venditto, a 64-year-old Republican in charge since 1998, negotiated union\nconcessions, cut discretionary spending and established a\nretirement-incentive program that he said collectively saved $26\nmillion in a budget of about $265 million. The balancing effort\nis now facing pressure, according to Venditto.  \u201cWe mapped out this course for economic recovery, with a\nview toward avoiding cash-flow problems,\u201d he said by phone.\n\u201cThat phase of recovery has become enmeshed in a battle royale\nbetween two colossal economic forces: Taubman and Simon.\u201d  The two mall giants, both run by sons of the billionaire\nfounders, have been squaring off in public hearings and courts\nfor decades. The friction reached a peak in 2003, when\nBloomfield Hills, Michigan-based Taubman, backed by  Michigan \u2019s\ngovernor, successfully fought off a takeover bid by\nIndianapolis-based Simon and Sydney-based Westfield Group.  Dueling Projects  In 1994, Taubman purchased an industrial lot in Oyster Bay\nwith plans to build a mall. When the council approved selling\npublic-works department property in May to Simon-backed Oyster\nBay Realty LLC, Taubman said it didn\u2019t get a chance to bid.\nVenditto said he was in talks with both companies, though he\nsaid selling to Oyster Bay Realty would help him achieve his\ngoal of blocking Taubman\u2019s project.  Taubman wants the neighboring land, because it has a better\nchance of clearing environmental hurdles for its mall project if\nit owns the parcel, which is only about 12 miles from Simon\u2019s\nRoosevelt Field mall. Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Oyster Bay\nRealty, said the firm plans to build a mixed residential and\ncommercial development. Venditto said the contract doesn\u2019t\nrequire the buyer to do anything for as long as eight years.  Opportunity Knocks  Robert Taubman, chief executive officer of Taubman Centers,\nsaid in a July 26 earnings call that he has no plans to back\ndown.  \u201cWe continue to believe, as we have for 20 years, that\nthis is perhaps the best opportunity to build a shopping center\nin the United States,\u201d Taubman said.  In the local-debt market this week, issuers including\nPuerto Rico\u2019s electric utility will borrow at the lowest\nmunicipal interest rates since July 24. At  2.86 percent , yields\non benchmark 10-year munis compare with  2.64 percent  for\nsimilar-maturity Treasuries.  The  ratio  of the yields, a gauge of relative value, is\nabout 108 percent, compared with an average of 93 percent since\n2001. The greater the figure, the cheaper munis are compared\nwith federal securities.
