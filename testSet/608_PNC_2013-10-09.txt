 "context": "The following article called 'Sides in Fiscal Fight Get No Push From Markets, Voters' was published on 2013-10-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVoters and investors are putting little pressure on President  Barack Obama  and Congress to resolve their fiscal standoff, even as a partial government shutdown lingers into a second week and the U.S. moves closer to a possible default.  With polls showing  majorities  of Democrats and Republicans backing their parties\u2019 stances and the reaction in financial markets muted, both sides are holding firm to long-standing positions. That means the stalemate may linger until the Oct. 17 deadline that the Treasury Department has set for Congress to raise the country\u2019s $16.7 trillion  debt  ceiling.  Fights over budgets and debt have gone to the brink before, raising expectations that lawmakers and the president will pull back again.  \u201cWe understand that they\u2019ll take us close to the edge but are reasonable enough not to go over the edge,\u201d James Dunigan, who helps oversee $118 billion as chief investment officer in Philadelphia at PNC Wealth Management, said by phone. \u201cIt continues to be just a game of chicken and rhetoric.\u201d  There are signals that concern is building as the stalemate drags on. While the benchmark  Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX)  is up 16 percent since the start of the year, it tumbled 1.2 percent to 1,655.45 in New York yesterday for its biggest drop since August and lowest close in a month.  The Treasury sold $30 billion of  one-month  bills yesterday at a rate of 0.35 percent, the highest since 2008 and more than double the rate on comparable one-month securities yesterday, signaling a lower risk appetite in  capital markets .  Economic Confidence  The impasse is also affecting consumers. Gallup\u2019s Economic Confidence Index dropped 12 points in the past week, the second-largest decrease after fall in September 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  In 2011, the last time that Obama and Congress were at a stalemate over the debt ceiling,  Standard & Poor\u2019s  lowered the government credit rating. Bond investors weren\u2019t dismayed and yields went down while equity markets were briefly rattled.  Obama yesterday offered the possible contours of a resolution, saying he could accept a short-term deal to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling while he negotiates with Republican leaders over fiscal policy and his signature health-care law.  \u201cIf reasonable Republicans want to talk about these things again, I\u2019m ready to head up to the Hill and try,\u201d Obama, 52, said at a White House news conference.  Dueling Demands  He maintained his demand that Republicans drop their conditions for dealing with either issue, which House Speaker  John Boehner  rejected.  \u201cWhat the president said today was if there\u2019s unconditional surrender by Republicans, he\u2019ll sit down,\u201d Boehner, 63, said at his own news conference at the Capitol. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way our government works.\u201d  Former New Hampshire Republican Senator  Judd Gregg  said he still expects reason to prevail.  \u201cI honestly still believe there\u2019ll be an agreement before there\u2019s a default,\u201d said Gregg, now chief executive officer of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. \u201cIt\u2019s not an imaginable course of action from the standpoint of reasonable people.\u201d  The public isn\u2019t in a compromising mood.  A majority of self-identified Democrats, 58 percent, say it would be unacceptable for Obama to agree to change the health-care law even if it\u2019s the only way to end the shutdown, according to an Oct. 3-9  poll  by the Pew Research Center in  Washington .  Republican Support  Almost the same share of Republicans, 54 percent, say they wouldn\u2019t support Republican leaders dropping their demands to change the health-care law, the national survey of 1,000 adults found. Among those who back the Tea Party wing of Republicans, 72 percent oppose any concessions.  Republican lawmakers say those numbers are backed up by what they are hearing from constituents.  \u201cWe\u2019re getting calls supporting it,\u201d Representative Markwayne Mullin, a freshman Oklahoma Republican aligned with the Tea Party movement, said about the shutdown. \u201cIn my district, they understand why we\u2019re fighting and what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d  Obama, too, has seen political benefits from the conflict.  His approval rating in an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Oct. 7 rose from 41 percent to 45 percent in the past week. Disapproval of Republicans over the same period grew from 63 percent to 70 percent in the survey, taken Oct. 2-6.  \u2018Chaos\u2019 Warning  In an effort to move the talks, Obama has been sounding the alarms, warning yesterday of the \u201cchaos\u201d that could result if the country defaults. He and his advisers have been contacting top business leaders with ties to Republicans to enlist their help.  \u201cIf the market and the economy starts to go south, then it is very easy for them to go to their congressional districts and say, \u2018Guys, I have to compromise, look what\u2019s happening,\u2019\u201d Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist who helps oversee $400 billion at JPMorgan Funds, said in a phone interview from  New York . \u201cIf they don\u2019t make a compromise on their own, the market and the economy will force them to.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Lisa Lerer in Washington at  llerer@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Steven Komarow at  skomarow1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
