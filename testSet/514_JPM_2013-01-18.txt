The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFederal Reserve officials in August\n2007 saw the beginnings of the crisis in subprime mortgages and\nconcluded that the  U.S. economy  would be able to withstand it,\ntranscripts from their 2007 meetings show.  \u201cWell-capitalized banks and opportunistic investors will\ncome in and fill the gap, restoring credit flows to nonfinancial\nbusinesses and to the vast majority of households that can\nservice their debts,\u201d  Donald Kohn , then vice chairman of the\nboard, said in Aug. 2007 according to transcripts of the Federal\nOpen Market Committee meetings released today in Washington.  The transcripts show the committee\u2019s slow grasp on the\nenormity of contagion that was to spread throughout global\nmarkets as a result of billions of dollars in low-quality\nhousing assets that had been securitized into bonds and sold to\nbanks and investors worldwide.  \u201cThe odds are that the market will stabilize,\u201d Bernanke\ntold the committee in Aug. 2007, according to the transcripts\nfrom that year. \u201cThis restrictive effect could come in various\nmagnitudes.

The Fed and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  rescued Bear\nStearns Cos. in March 2008, and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\ncollapsed into bankruptcy that September. Both Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley converted to bank holding\ncompanies to access backup funding from the discount window.  Rate Unchanged  U.S. central bankers kept their benchmark lending rate\nunchanged at their regularly scheduled meeting on Aug. 7, 2007,\nsaying in their statement that \u201cthe predominant policy concern\nremains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as\nexpected.\u201d  Fed officials did have a legitimate inflation worry in\n2007. Revised data shows the personal consumption expenditures\nprice index rising at a 3.5 percent rate for the year ending\nthat December. The  unemployment rate  hit a low of 4.4 percent in\nMarch and May. Still, financial markets were beginning to\nunravel.
