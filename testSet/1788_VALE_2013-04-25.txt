 "context": "The following article called 'Vale Gains as Cuts End Two Years of Profit Disappointment' was published on 2013-04-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVale SA (VALE5)  rose after profit beat\nanalysts\u2019 estimates for the first time in two years on cost\nreductions and higher copper sales that offset lower prices for\nthe steel ingredient.  Shares in the world\u2019s third-largest mining company  rose  for\na fifth straight day, gaining 1.4 percent to 32.55 reais at the\nclose of trading in  Sao Paulo , the highest price since April 12.\nBHP Billiton Ltd. and  Rio Tinto  Group, the largest miners, rose\n1.7 percent and 1.4 respectively in  London .  First-quarter net income of $3.11 billion, or 60 cents a\nshare, compared with a loss of $2.7 billion, or 52 cents, in the\nprevious three-month period, according to a statement after the\nclose of trading yesterday.  Vale  was expected to post per-share\nprofit excluding items of 55.8 cents, the average of 13\nanalysts\u2019 estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg. Vale, the  worst-\nperforming  major mining stock this year, is seeking to bolster\ninvestor confidence by putting lower-return projects on hold,\nselling assets and cutting costs.  \u201cVale reported a much stronger-than-expected 1Q13, driven\nby lower costs and expenses and a stronger performance from the\nbase metals business,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts\n Marcelo Aguiar  and Diogo Miura wrote in a note to clients today.\n\u201cThese drivers should provide a strong catalyst to consensus\nearnings upgrades and reduce the bearish sentiment towards\nVale.\u201d  Iron Prices  The company\u2019s profit, boosted by the partial booking of a\ngold deal with  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  in February, is the first\nquarter-on-quarter increase since the first three months of\n2011. Net income fell from $3.79 billion, or 74 cents, in the\nyear-ago period.  Net sales  fell  5.3 percent to $10.9 billion in the period\nafter Vale sold its iron ore at an average $111.69 per metric\nton, 5.4 percent less than a year earlier. That was below the\n$121 per ton average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nVale shipped 65.1 million metric tons of  iron ore  and pellets, a\nprocessed form of the mineral, during the quarter, little\nchanged from the previous year.  Costs and expenses shrank by $900 million in the quarter\ncompared to a year ago and by $2.5 billion versus the fourth\nquarter of 2012, Chief Financial Officer Luciano Siani said in a\nvideo posted on the company\u2019s  website  yesterday.  Costs, Expenses  \u201cFor the first time in more than 40 quarters, costs and\nexpenses was the main driver of improvement,\u201d Chief Executive\nOfficer Murilo Ferreira told analysts today during a conference\ncall to discuss the results. \u201cThis is not a one-off event.\u201d  Vale lost 23 percent in the 12 months through yesterday,\ncompared with an 11 percent decrease in  Brazil \u2019s benchmark\nIbovespa Index.  BHP Billiton  and Rio Tinto lost 9.6 percent and\n12 percent, respectively, during the same period.  Net income surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations by 20 percent,\nthe first positive surprise in eight quarters, according to  data \ncompiled by Bloomberg. The company booked $244 million in pretax\nprofits following a $1.9 billion gold deal with Silver Wheaton\nin February, it said.  The first-quarter result \u201ccreates a potentially positive\nmomentum on earnings estimates,\u201d Bank of America Corp. analysts\nled by Felipe Hirai said in a note to clients. \u201cEven without\nhigher iron ore prices, Vale\u2019s earnings might be revised\nupwards, while its competitors\u2019 could be declining.\u201d  Better Prices  Iron-ore  prices  have recovered 56 percent from a three-year\nlow in September on accelerating demand from  China , the biggest\nmetals consumer. While prices may weaken in the second half of\nthis year, iron ore traded at an average of $148.1 a ton in the\nfirst quarter, 4.4 percent more than last year, according to\ndata from the Steel  Index (IBOV)  Ltd.  Producers in  Australia , the largest iron-ore exporter, are\nlikely to boost supply by as much as 40 million metric tons\nduring the second half of the year, putting some downward\npressure on prices, Vale\u2019s head of ferrous and strategy Jose Carlos Martins said today.  \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that the price of iron ore can suffer\ntoo much,\u201d he said during the same analysts call. \u201cI don\u2019t\nbelieve that the price can go below $110 per ton on a\nsustainable basis.\u201d  Nickel Partnership  Vale sold 34 percent of its iron ore in the first quarter\nat spot prices on delivery at the port, compared to 2 percent\nlast year, the company said in a  presentation  today. Clients in\nChina are increasingly buying at future prices to avoid the\nsteelmaking ingredient\u2019s fluctuations, Martins said.  Vale, the world\u2019s biggest nickel producer after Moscow-\nbased OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, shipped 63,000 metric tons of the\nmetal in the quarter at an average selling price 13 percent\nlower than in 2012. While copper shipments rose 24 percent to\n72,000 metric tons, average realized prices also decreased 13\npercent, the company said.  Vale also said in yesterday\u2019s statement that it\u2019s\nconsidering a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d at its Thompson nickel\noperation in  Canada  to finance the expansion of existing mines.\nThe company\u2019s VNC nickel project in  New Caledonia  continues to\naccelerate production and is expected to reach 45,000 metric\ntons of output next year, it said.  Vale, which expects to pay at least $4 billion in dividends\nthis year, is not considering boosting its 2013 shareholders\u2019\ncompensation at this point, CEO Ferreira said today. Renato Gomes, the head of investors relations at shareholder Bradespar\nSA, said April 19 that there was a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d\nthat Vale would be able to pay more than the $4 billion after\nenjoying better-than-expected iron-ore prices. Bradespar holds a\n5.9 stake percent in Vale.
