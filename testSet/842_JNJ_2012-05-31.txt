 "context": "The following article called 'House Passes FDA\u2019s $6.4 Billion Fee Plan for Drug Reviews' was published on 2012-05-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe $6.4 billion accord that  Teva\nPharmaceutical Industries Inc. (TEVA) ,  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and other\ncompanies reached with U.S. regulators to fund new medicine and\ndevice reviews through 2017 passed the  House of Representatives .  The House voted late yesterday 387-5 in favor of the\nlegislation, which is similar to a measure approved by the\nSenate May 24. Lawmakers must reconcile differences in the\nbills, such as dates for the  Food and Drug Administration  to\ncomply with certain provisions and language in the Senate\u2019s\nversion that would require more scrutiny for some new devices.  The legislation would raise the so-called user fees\nindustries pay the FDA for safety and efficacy reviews by more\nthan $2 billion from the previous five-year period. Drugmakers\nin September and device companies in February agreed to the\nincreases in exchange for more meetings with the FDA throughout\nthe review process that may produce faster product approvals.  \u201cThis bill will foster American innovation because it\nincludes significant accountability and reform measures designed\nto hold the FDA responsible for its performance,\u201d\nRepresentative  Fred Upton , a Republican from Michigan and\nchairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said during\ndebate on the bill.  The Food and Drug Administration Reform Act of 2012, H.R.\n5651, also includes measures to speed approval of treatments for\nlife-threatening conditions, enhance safety monitoring of\ndevices after clearance and mitigate drug shortages. The Senate\nand House bills must be reconciled in time for the president to\nsign the legislation by an Oct. 1 deadline.  Generic Drugs  Brand-name drugmakers will pay $4.1 billion, 6 percent more\nthan the previous five-year period, while fees for device makers\nwill more than double to $609 million, according to the\n Congressional Budget Office \u2019s  cost estimate . Brand-name\ndrugmakers have paid the fees since 1992 and device makers began\ntheir system in 2002.  Generic-drug companies, which had been exempt from user\nfees, will pay $1.58 billion. Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based\n Mylan Inc. (MYL) , the largest U.S. maker of copycat medicines, led its\nindustry effort to participate in the fee program to quicken\nreview times and deal with a backlog of applications, as well as\nto ensure the FDA has the resources to inspect foreign plants.  Companies making generic versions of complex biologic\ndrugs, a process not allowed until passage of President  Barack Obama \u2019s health law in 2010, will pay user fees, which the budget\noffice determined would total $128 million through 2017.  Tracking System  Lawmakers sought to adjust regulatory oversight of medical\ndevices, requiring post-market studies and pushing the FDA to\nimplement a system to electronically track the products. The\nlegislation also directs the agency to use an accelerated\napproval program already taken advantage of by cancer and AIDS\ntreatments that requires a lower standard of evidence for\ninitial clearance of medicines for life-threatening diseases.  The legislation requires companies to report potential drug\nshortages to give regulators time to find alternate sources.\nShortages, including cancer treatments, almost tripled to 178 in\n2010 from 61 in 2005, according to a FDA report released in\nOctober.  Senators Michael Bennet, a Democrat from  Colorado , and\n Richard Burr , a Republican of  North Carolina , are working on\nlanguage for a final bill that would help the FDA better police\ndrugs from manufacturing to distribution to pharmacies.\nRepresentatives Brian Bilbray, a Republican from California, and\nJim Matheson, a Democrat from  Utah , have worked on the issue in\nthe House, and plan to be involved in negotiating a tracking\nsystem when the House and Senate merge their bills, Fred Tayco,\na spokesman for Bilbray, said.
