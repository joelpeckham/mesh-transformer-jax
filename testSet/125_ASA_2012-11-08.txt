 "context": "The following article called 'Largest Oil-Tankers Curb Weeks of Losses as Fuel Price Falls' was published on 2012-11-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCrude tankers shipping almost 20\npercent of the world\u2019s oil curbed seven weeks of losses as\ndeclining fuel costs helped owners contending with the biggest\nfleet growth in three decades.  The ships delivering 2 million barrel cargoes of Saudi\nArabian oil to  Japan , a benchmark voyage, made positive returns\nof $694 a day today, according to data from the  Baltic Exchange \nin  London . Charter costs slumped so low since Sept. 21 that\nrates didn\u2019t cover the cost of crew, insurance or other\noperating costs, causing owners to contribute an average of\nabout $3,500 a day to fuel expenses, bourse calculations show.  \u201cThe fact this benchmark is so seldom positive just shows\nhow dreadful the market is right now,\u201d Will Leslie, head of\ntanker derivatives at ACM-GFI, a London-based broker of\ncontracts used to hedge shipping rates, said by e-mail today.\n\u201cThere are too many ships and unfortunately I don\u2019t think we\u2019re\ngoing to see a massive shift to higher earnings.\u201d  The fleet\u2019s capacity expanded more than three times faster\nthan cargo demand since 2008, after owners added the most new\nvessels to the fleet since the start of the 1980s, according to\ndata from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world\u2019s largest shipbroker. Fuel\nfell 7.6 percent to $613.76 a metric ton since the end of\nAugust, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is\ngiving a bigger boost to earnings than any short-term\ncontraction in ship supply, according to Arctic Securities ASA,\nan Oslo-based investment bank.  Global Benchmark  The Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route is a benchmark for freight\nswaps that traders use to bet on, or hedge, crude oil shipping\ncosts. The contracts for December are trading at $1.70 a barrel\ncompared with $1.44 a barrel this month, according to data from\nMarex Spectron Group, a London-based broker of the contracts.  The Baltic Exchange\u2019s earnings formula doesn\u2019t take into\naccount the fact ships cut speed to lower fuel consumption. The\nlargest  oil tankers , known in the industry as very large crude\ncarriers, or VLCCs, can earn about $11,000 a day by sailing on\nthe empty leg of journeys at 10 knots, compared with a typical\nspeed of about 13 knots, Arctic analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth\nsaid in a report today.  The vessels need about $10,670 to cover crew, insurance and\nother operating costs, according to Moore Stephens LLC, a U.K.-\nbased consultant. Rates for the vessels will average $21,000\nthis year, according to 14 analyst estimates compiled by\nBloomberg.  Supply Shrinks  Frontline Ltd., the biggest operator of the ships, led by\nbillionaire  John Fredriksen , said Aug. 29 it needs $23,900 a day\nto break even. Shares of the Hamilton, Bermuda-based company\ngained 0.8 percent to close at 18.39 kroner ($3.21) in Oslo\ntrading.  The supply of VLCCs available for charter over the next\nfour weeks contracted by two to 78, Marex Spectron said in an e-\nmailed report today. That compares with 87 vessels at the start\nof the month, Marex data showed.  Charter  costs  for VLCCs on the benchmark voyage added 2.7\npercent to 37.75 industry-standard Worldscale points today,\nexchange data showed. Yesterday they gained the most in almost\nthree months.  The Worldscale system is a method for pricing oil cargoes\non thousands of trade routes. Each individual voyage\u2019s flat\nrate, expressed in dollars a ton, is set once a year. Today\u2019s\nlevel means hire costs on the benchmark route are 37.75 percent\nof the nominal Worldscale rate for that voyage.  VLCCs carry about 17.3 million barrels a day of crude,\naccording to Clarkson data. Global demand will be 89.7 million\nbarrels a day this year, according to the  International Energy\nAgency , a Paris-based adviser to oil-consuming nations.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, a broader measure of oil-\nshipping costs that includes vessels smaller than VLCCs, added\n0.8 percent to 667, according to the exchange.
