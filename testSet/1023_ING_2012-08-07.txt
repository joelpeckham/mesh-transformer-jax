 "context": "The following article called 'DSM to Cut 1,000 Jobs as Chief Strives to Meet Profit Goals' was published on 2012-08-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRoyal DSM NV (DSM) , the world\u2019s largest\nmaker of vitamins, will cut 1,000 jobs across  Europe  as Chief\nExecutive Officer Feike Sijbesma strives to meet profit goals.  Cutting more than 4 percent of the workforce will help\nboost profit by 150 million euros ($185 million), Sijbesma and\nChief Financial Officer Rolf-Dieter Schwalb said on a call. DSM,\nbased in Heerlen, the Netherlands, fell as much as 5 percent to\n39.14 euros after highlighting increased doubt over the strength\nof Europe\u2019s economies.  \u201cThe program comes a bit too late,\u201d said Fabian Smeets,\nan analyst at ING, adding coatings company Akzo Nobel is halfway\nthrough with its restructuring program by now.  DSM is suffering from competition in  China  and lower prices\nin caprolactam, one of its last commodity businesses that\nremains an integral part of its polymers operation. Sijbesma has\nsteered DSM away from commodities into enzymes and nutritional\ningredients. Aggressive pricing by new entrants to the\ncaprolactam market and higher benzene costs are weighing on\nmargins, yet the business remains strategic for DSM and won\u2019t be\nsold, Schwalb said in an interview.  Shares of DSM traded 39.44 euros as of 11:06 a.m. in\nAmsterdam.  Outlook Dims  The global outlook for the second half has become more\nclouded, in part because of Europe\u2019s failure to find a cure for\nthe lingering debt crisis, Sijbesma said. The region will bear\nthe brunt of the job cuts, with 400 positions to be slashed in\nthe Netherlands, he said.  \u201cWe cannot ignore the fact that the economy is not\nimproving, it is rather the opposite,\u201d Schwalb said. \u201cThe\ncost-reduction program is designed to support the targets.\u201d  The program was essential for DSM as it seeks to make a\n2013  earnings target  of 1.4 billion euros to 1.6 billion euros.\nDSM will spend about 125 million euros as it carries out the\noverhaul over the next 18 months. Schwalb said there\u2019s scope for\nadded improvements beyond the initial target.  \u201cFrom prior programs, we\u2019re well known for over-\ndelivering,\u201d the CFO said in an interview. Any additional\npotential for boosting profit would be detailed at a later date,\nhe said.  The vitamin maker, which expanded in baby-food ingredients\nwith the purchase of Martek, reported a 14 percent decline in\nsecond-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and\ndepreciation from continuing operations to 290 million euros.\nAnalysts predicted 292 million euros, according to the average\nof 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales were little changed\nat 2.27 billion euros.  Nutrition Disappointment  \u201cUnderlying, results were very disappointing. We knew\nPerformance Materials and Polymer Intermediates were facing\nheadwinds, but the 2 percent organic growth at Nutrition,\ndespite having Martek now over a year, clearly is a negative\nsurprise,\u201d said Smeets, who has a hold-rating on DSM.  Polymer intermediates, which make raw materials for\nsynthetic fibers and plastics, weighed on results. Caprolactam,\nused in carpets and clothing, cut profit by 70 million euros.  DSM\u2019s expansion into Omega 3-oil supplements, through the\nacquisition of Ocean Nutrition for $529 million, and into\nsynthetic protein-based materials used in medical implants with\nthe purchase earlier this year of Kensey Nash helped bolster\nprofit. The company retains 1.9 billion euros in cash and\ncontinues to look for additional purchases, Sijbesma said.
