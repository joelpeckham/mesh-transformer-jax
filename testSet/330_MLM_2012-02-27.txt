(VMC)  and hostile\nsuitor  Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (MLM)  face off in Delaware \nChancery Court tomorrow in a trial over a $4.7 billion \ntakeover that would create the world\u2019s largest producer of \nsand, gravel and crushed stone.  The court\u2019s chief judge, Leo Strine Jr., must decide\nwhether a 2010 agreement between the companies prohibits Martin\nMarietta from offering to buy Vulcan\u2019s public shares and\nsoliciting votes for five nominees for its board, according to\ncourt papers. Strine also has to say whether the agreement\nlimits litigation to courts in Delaware. Martin Marietta filed\nthe case, asking the court to declare that it hasn\u2019t violated\nany agreement with Vulcan.  Martin Marietta, based in Raleigh,  North Carolina , offered\non Dec. 12 to exchange half a share for each share of Vulcan and\npay a quarterly dividend equal to 20 cents a Vulcan share to\npartly restore the dividend cut to 1 cent last year.  Vulcan Chairman Don James has said Martin Marietta is\ntrying to take advantage of a construction recession to buy\nVulcan with a \u201cvery low-ball\u201d offer. Vulcan has been saddled\nwith debt and losses after it paid $4.2 billion for Florida Rock\nIndustries Inc. in 2007 just before the industry slumped.  Vulcan, based in Birmingham,  Alabama , posted net losses in\nthe past two years and is forecast to lose $48 million this\nyear, according to Bloomberg data.  Martin Marietta  has reported\nprofits since at least 1992, and earnings this year are forecast\nto be $114 million.  Martin Marietta CEO Ward Nye and James began merger talks\nin April 2010 and reached the point of studying transaction\nstructures and proposing names for the combined company, Martin\nMarietta said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission.  End of Talks  James told the Vulcan board July 8 that the merger\nnegotiations had ceased, according to a company filing. The\ndiscussions broke down over the amount of cost savings and who\nwould run the combined company, according to the Martin Marietta\nfiling.  Vulcan called the hostile offer illegal, claiming that\nMartin Marietta obtained \u201chighly sensitive, material, nonpublic\nand confidential information\u201d under two agreements, according\nto a Dec. 22 statement in which the company formally rejected\nthe bid.  Martin Marietta said in a Dec. 22 statement there are no\nsignificant regulatory or legal obstacles to completing the\ntransaction.  Martin Marietta has proposed candidates for five Vulcan\nboard seats to be filled at the annual shareholders meeting in\nMay, not enough to control the 11-member board. Vulcan pledged\nto sell assets for as much as $500 million to reduce debt and\ncut costs by $155 million to rally shareholder support.  Martin Marietta  \u201cAn injunction barring Martin Marietta\u2019s exchange offer\nand proposal could prevent Vulcan\u2019s stockholders from directly\nconsidering their merits,\u201d a lawyer for Martin Marietta, Robert S. Saunders, wrote in its complaint.  Collins J. Seitz Jr., a lawyer representing Vulcan,\ncontends in court papers that Martin Marietta\u2019s bid constitutes\nan unlawful scheme to seize control of the company.  \u201cMartin Marietta\u2019s conduct constitutes not only breaches\nof express contractual obligations, but it offends basic\nprinciples of business ethics and fair dealing as well,\u201d Seitz\nwrote.  The  Delaware  lawsuit is one of at least four being pursued\nin three states over the deal.  In a case filed Dec. 27 in federal court in Birmingham, KBC\nAsset Management NV, with more than 44,000 Vulcan shares,\ncontends the offer is a good one in light of poor recent company\nperformance. KBC asked a judge to order meaningful negotiations.  Multiple Cases  Vulcan sued in the same Alabama court Dec. 19 asking a\njudge to block the takeover. Martin Marietta also sued Vulcan\nDec. 12 in Superior Court in Trenton,  New Jersey , with\nallegations similar to those in Delaware. trading  Martin Marietta fell 14 cents to $87.73 Feb. 24 in New York\nStock Exchange composite trading, valuing the deal at about\n$43.87 per share. Vulcan fell 23 cents to $46.17.  The case is Martin Marietta Materials v. Vulcan Materials,\nCA7102, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).
