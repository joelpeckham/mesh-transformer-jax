 "context": "The following article called 'Australian Dollar Drops as Stocks Fall; Kiwi Gains Versus Aussie' was published on 2013-01-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia \u2019s dollar slid against most\nof its 16 major counterparts as Asian stocks declined, sapping\ndemand for higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand\u2019s dollar climbed toward a three-month high\nversus the so-called Aussie after the smaller nation\u2019s central\nbank said it expects the economy to recover. Losses were limited\nin the New Zealand and Australian currencies ahead of a Chinese\nreport tomorrow that economists predict will show manufacturing\nexpanded this month in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  \u201cRisk sentiment is deteriorating on the back of stock\ndeclines, weighing on the Australian and New Zealand dollars,\u201d\nsaid Kengo Suzuki, a currency strategist in  Tokyo  at Mizuho\nSecurities Co., a unit of  Japan \u2019s third-largest bank by market\nvalue.  Australia\u2019s dollar dropped 0.3 percent to $1.0390 as of\n3:58 p.m. in Sydney and is little changed this month. New\nZealand\u2019s currency, known as the kiwi, fell 0.1 percent to 83.50\nU.S. cents, paring a monthly gain to 0.8 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares lost 0.3 percent,\nsnapping a two-day gain.  The kiwi strengthened 0.1 percent to NZ$1.2442 per\nAustralian dollar. It reached NZ$1.2429 on Jan. 25, the\nstrongest since Oct. 9. Two-year  interest-rate swaps  in New\nZealand fell one basis point to 2.89 percent.  RBNZ Decision  Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Graeme Wheeler said in\na statement that global growth is set to recover in 2013, after\nleaving the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5 percent.\nThe central bank \u201cdoes not want to see financial stability or\ninflation risks accentuated by housing demand getting too far\nahead of supply,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis is the clearest indicator that the next move is up\nfor the cash rate as housing supply always responds with a\nlag,\u201d  Annette Beacher  and Alvin Pontoh, analysts in Singapore\nat TD Securities Inc., wrote in a research note. \u201cThe not-\ndovish stance taken by Wheeler took the markets by surprise.\u201d  A  gauge  of house prices in the country climbed to a record\nhigh in November and remained closer to that level last month,\naccording to data from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand.  The Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index for  China \u2019s manufacturing\nwill probably rise to 51 in January, the highest since April,\nfrom 50.6 last month, according to the median estimate of\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The National Bureau of\nStatistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing will\nrelease the data tomorrow.  Aussie-Euro  The  yield  on Australia\u2019s benchmark three-year note dropped\nfor the first time in five sessions, sliding four basis points\nto 2.83 percent. The rate touched 2.9 percent yesterday, the\nhighest since Aug. 16.  The Australian dollar-U.S. currency pair \u201cis now very much\nbeing driven by moves\u201d in the Australian dollar-euro rate, Ray Attrill, global co-head of currency strategy at National\nAustralia Bank Ltd. in Sydney, wrote in a report today. \u201cAmid\nevidence from our own internal flow data that foreign asset\nmanagers continue to liquidate holding of Australian government\nbonds, this is exposing renewed downside vulnerability\u201d to the\nAussie against the greenback, he wrote.  Australia\u2019s currency fell 0.3 percent to 76.58 euro cents\nafter earlier touching 76.48, the lowest since Dec. 20, 2011.
