 "context": "The following article called 'Vestas Valuation Tempting Buyers Tilting at Windmills: Real M&A' was published on 2012-04-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFor companies prepared to buy into\nthe future of wind power,  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  offers the\nchance to grab the world\u2019s largest turbine maker for less than\nit would be valued at in a fire sale.  Vestas traded at a record low of 0.52 times net assets last\nweek, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, before\nspeculation emerged that its two biggest Chinese rivals,  Sinovel\nWind Group Co. (601558)  and Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.,\nare considering a bid. Even after Vestas jumped by the most in\nmore than two months, it was still valued at a 76 percent\ndiscount to sales yesterday, less than any renewable-energy\nequipment maker with at least $1 billion in market value.  While Vestas  lost money  on each dollar of sales last year\nas turbine prices fell and is now grappling with the loss of\nwind-project subsidies in the U.S., Spain and  India , the Aarhus,\nDenmark-based company could still lure buyers with its\ntechnological expertise and market position, Sydbank A/S said.\nSinovel and Goldwind, which get almost all their sales in  China ,\ncould expand in the U.S. and  Europe  by acquiring Vestas, while\nindustrial companies in  South Korea  may want Vestas to gain a\nfoothold in  wind energy , Sydbank and Danske Markets said.  \u201cVestas has one of the most developed technology platforms\nand a truly global distribution network,\u201d Kasper From Larsen,\nan analyst at Danske in Copenhagen, said in a phone interview.\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting the asset right now for a very low price. You\ncould have several industry players looking at the company.\u201d  Today\u2019s Trading  When asked this week in an interview at the European Wind\nEnergy Association conference in Copenhagen whether the company\nhas received any takeover approaches or whether it would\nentertain any offers, Vestas Chief Executive Officer  Ditlev Engel  declined to comment.  Shares of Vestas climbed 5.1 percent to 54.05 kroner as of\n5:16 p.m. in Copenhagen today. The gain was the second biggest\nin Europe\u2019s benchmark  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   Vestas was  set up  in the small farming town of Lem in 1898\nin a blacksmith workshop, becoming a manufacturer of steel\nwindow frames for industrial buildings and later household\nappliances and agricultural equipment, according to its website.\nThe company delivered its first  wind turbines  in 1979 and is now\nthe world\u2019s biggest wind turbine maker, reaching 50 gigawatts of\ncumulative installed machines this year -- about a fifth of the\nglobal total, according to the company\u2019s website and the\nBrussels-based  Global Wind Energy Council . A gigawatt is about\nenough power to supply 800,000 homes in the U.S.  After increasing revenue each year for a decade since going\npublic in 1998 and posting record  operating earnings  in 2008,\nVestas had sales declines in two of the past three years and\nposted a net loss in 2011 as falling turbine prices squeezed\nmargins and growth in installations across the industry slowed.  Costs, Delays  Vestas, with a market value of 10.5 billion kroner ($1.9\nbillion) as of yesterday, attributed the loss to higher-than-\nexpected development costs from its flagship V112 turbine and a\ndelay in starting a generator factory.  The company\u2019s chief financial officer resigned in February,\na month after Vestas said it would cut 2,335 jobs as part of\ncost-reduction measures.  Industrywide,  prices  of turbines sold in the second half of\n2011 fell to 910,000 euros ($1.2 million) a megawatt, the lowest\nsince at least 2008, when records began, according to Bloomberg\nNew Energy Finance. Wind-power  installations , which grew at an\nannual rate of about 36 percent in the five years through 2009,\nexpanded just over 5 percent the following two years combined,\naccording to Global Wind Energy Council data, as banks tightened\nfinancing and governments threatened to rein in support for\nclean-energy projects.  Renewable-Energy Subsidies  Spain  in January declared a moratorium on subsidies to new\nrenewable-energy plants, while India, the world\u2019s third-biggest\nwind market, reduced a tax break this month.  In the U.S., the second-biggest turbine market after China,\na Treasury grant program offering as much as 30 percent of\ndevelopment and construction costs for renewable-energy plants\nexpired on Dec. 31. Another incentive, the Production Tax\nCredit, expires at the end of 2012. Vestas in January said it\nmay cut an additional 1,600 jobs in the U.S. if lawmakers don\u2019t\nextend the credit, which gives an incentive of 2.2 cents a\nkilowatt-hour of wind power.  Vestas stock, which reached a record 692 kroner in June\n2008, fell 72 percent  in the past year  to 51.45 kroner through\nyesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u2018Tough Time\u2019  \u201cVestas is going through a pretty tough time,\u201d Edward Guinness, who helps oversee $900 million at Guinness Asset\nManagement Ltd. in  London , including Vestas shares, said in a\nphone interview. \u201cThey really have not coped brilliantly with\nthe falling prices of turbines and it\u2019s a disappointment that\nthey didn\u2019t act faster on bringing costs down. There\u2019s been hope\nthat things would get better, and they haven\u2019t.\u201d  The slump in Vestas shares left the company trading at a 48\npercent discount to the value of its assets minus liabilities,\nits lowest price-to-book ratio on record, data compiled by\nBloomberg show, before speculation emerged this week about the\ncompany attracting takeover interest.  Sinovel and  Goldwind (002202)  are considering a bid for Vestas, the\nnewspaper Jyllands-Posten  reported  this week, citing\nunidentified people it said were close to the process. After the\nreport, Danish Energy Minister Martin Lidegaard said the\ngovernment wouldn\u2019t block a possible bid for Vestas by a Chinese\ncompany.  Xiao Qiang, media manager for Beijing-based Sinovel, said\nthe company had no comment as to whether it\u2019s considering a bid\nfor Vestas. A spokesman for Goldwind said the Xinjiang-based\ncompany also declined to comment.  Discount to Sales  Even after gaining more than 5 percent this week, Vestas\nstill traded yesterday at 0.54 times book value, compared with\nan average price-to-book ratio of 3.08 for renewable-energy\nequipment makers with a market capitalization greater than $1\nbillion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A price-to-book ratio\nof less than 1 implies a company would fetch more if\nshareholders fired management and sold all of its assets.  Vestas also traded at 0.24 times its sales, the lowest of\nthe group, the data show.  For Sinovel and Goldwind, which derive the bulk of their\nrevenue in China, purchasing Vestas would give them access to\nmarkets around the world and to the company\u2019s technology,\naccording to  Jacob Pedersen , an Aabenraa, Denmark-based analyst\nat Sydbank. Vestas wind turbines operate in 69 countries\nworldwide, according to the company\u2019s website.  \u2018Strategic Sense\u2019  \u201cIt makes very good strategic sense for the Chinese\ncompanies,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cWhat they lack is quality and\npresence outside China, and that\u2019s exactly what Vestas has\ngot.\u201d  Vestas could also be of interest to large companies in\n Japan , where the government has been pushing for alternatives to\nnuclear energy after last year\u2019s Fukushima disaster, and in\nSouth Korea, which is setting itself up as a green technologies\nmanufacturing base, Pedersen said.  For a diversified company such as  General Electric Co. (GE) ,\nwhich makes everything from wind turbines to medical-imaging\nequipment, Vestas may also be a good fit, said Danske\u2019s From\nLarsen. The Danish turbine maker could help Fairfield,\nConnecticut-based GE expand its wind operations and add to its\ntechnological expertise, he said. Lindsay Theile, a spokeswoman\nfor GE, declined to comment.  Despite the takeover speculation,  short sellers  have become\nincreasingly pessimistic on the prospects for Vestas. In a short\nsale, traders sell borrowed stock on the assumption the price\nwill decline and enable them to profit by buying the shares back\nat a lower price.  Bearish Bets  More than 22 percent of Vestas\u2019s 203.7 million outstanding\nshares were sold short as of April 17, the highest percentage on\nrecord for the company, according to New York-based research\nfirm  Data Explorers . Short interest in Vestas also exceeded 597\nstocks in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, in which companies average\nabout 3 percent.  Vestas may have trouble luring a buyer while the wind\nindustry faces a decline in demand and excess production\ncapacity, according to David Vos, a London-based analyst at\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co. The company can manufacture more than\n8,500 megawatts of turbines a year, according to its  annual\nreport . Turbine production and shipments totaled 5,054 megawatts\nlast year, or about 60 percent of capacity.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense for any player to add so much\ncapacity to their operations at this point in time,\u201d Vos said.\n\u201cThe major conglomerates who might have the spending power to\npurchase assets have overcapacity themselves, and you\u2019re facing\na structural demand decline over the next two or three years.\u201d  China Headwinds  Speculated Chinese buyers such as Goldwind may find it\ndifficult to get financing for a large acquisition, according to\nGuo Shou, a Hong Kong-based analyst at  Barclays Capital .\nGoldwind, which has a market value of about $3 billion, said\nlast week that profit may have been wiped out in the first\nquarter as the wind market slowed and prices fell.  Still, the wind industry\u2019s long-term growth potential could\nmake Vestas attractive, said Guinness at Guinness Asset\nManagement. The Global Wind Energy Council forecasts annual wind\ninstallations will grow at an average of 8 percent a year for\nthe five years through 2016, more than doubling total installed\ncapacity worldwide.  Vestas predicts shipments to rise to 7 gigawatts of\nturbines this year from 5 gigawatts last year. The company\u2019s\nbacklog of orders rose to 9,552 megawatts at the end of 2011,\nworth about 9.6 billion euros in future sales, a record for the\ncompany, according to its annual report, and analysts project\nthe company will return to profit this year.  Long View  A strategic buyer could afford to pay about 80 kroner a\nshare because it can \u201cunlock value through restructuring and\nsynergies,\u201d Patrick Hummel, an analyst at UBS AG in Zurich,\nsaid in an e-mail. While that would equate to more than a 55\npercent premium to yesterday\u2019s closing price, it would still\nvalue Vestas at a 16 percent discount to its book value of 94.68\nkroner a share, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cUltimately, you\u2019ve got a good, solid business here with a\nvery attractive product that is just going through a low point\nin the cycle,\u201d Guinness said. \u201cYou have to have a long-term\nperspective.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nKatia Porzecanski in  New York  at \n kporzecansk1@bloomberg.net ;\nSally Bakewell in London at \n Sbakewell1@bloomberg.net ;\nAlex Morales in Copenhagen via \n amorales2@bloomberg.net .
