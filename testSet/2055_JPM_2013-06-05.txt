The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIsraeli innovators are getting some love in the U.S. public markets, as SodaStream International can attest. The company behind the popular homemade soda machines has seen its stock jump 57 percent this year. Another Israeli startup called Wixpress may try to replicate some of that success with a possible initial public offering. Wixpress, a maker of website-development software that's more commonly known as  Wix.com , said yesterday it submitted a draft registration to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a possible IPO. Wix has helped 35 million people build websites, and the company plans to add Korean and Turkish to its current offering of nine languages. Bloomberg News reported in February that Wix had chosen JPMorgan Chase to lead an initial public offering in the U.S. and would seek about $75 million. Omer Shai, the company's vice president of marketing, declined to comment on any aspect of a possible IPO. A successful Wix IPO would be the first by an Israeli technology company in months, said Koby Simana, chief executive officer of the IVC Research Center in Tel Aviv. He said the last significant IPO was by Imperva, a maker of firewall software for Web applications. Imperva raised $90 million in the U.S. in November 2011. \u201cIt is the right time for Wix,\u201d said Simana. \u201cFrom Caesarstone to SodaStream, you can see there is a drive for Israeli innovation, and the global market appreciates such companies.\u201d Caesarstone Sdot-Yam, a maker of quartz kitchen countertops, rose 44 percent last year, and the stock is up 69 percent this year. SodaStream raised $109 million in 2010. Wix is based in Tel Aviv, and also has offices in Brazil and the Ukraine. The company charges monthly fees for users to remove the company's branding from the sites they build and for its e-commerce feature. Wix also takes a cut from companies that sell products to the site\u2019s user base. The company said it\u2019s adding 1.3 million users a month. But it may face challenges from newcomers such as Webydo, Simana said. Some people in Wix\u2019s homeland may be disappointed to learn that there are no immediate plans to offer a version of the tool in Hebrew. It's just too difficult to support a language that reads right to left, said Shai.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 42.549156188964844 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
