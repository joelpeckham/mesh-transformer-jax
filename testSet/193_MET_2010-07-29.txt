The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S.  Department of Veterans\nAffairs  is investigating life insurance companies\u2019 practice of\nputting veterans\u2019 death benefits in corporate accounts and\nkeeping most of the investment profits instead of paying the\nsurvivors.  \n \u201cThe possibility that life insurance companies are\nprofiting inappropriately from these service members\u2019 sacrifice\nis completely unacceptable,\u201d Mike Walcoff, acting\nundersecretary for the agency\u2019s  Veterans Benefit Administration ,\nsaid yesterday in a statement that announced the investigation.  \n Bloomberg Markets magazine reported what has become a\nstandard practice for life insurance policies issued by\ncompanies including  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  and  MetLife Inc. (MET)   \n Instead of paying a lump sum to survivors when a\npolicyholder dies, insurers keep the money in their own\naccounts, pay uncompetitive  interest rates  to survivors and give\nthem misleading guarantees about the safety of the funds.  \n Prudential, the second-largest life insurer, handles life\ninsurance policies for U.S. military personnel and veterans. New\nYork-based MetLife, the largest life insurer in the U.S.,\nprovides insurance for nonmilitary federal employees.  \n \u201cThe purpose of these benefits is to assist grieving\nsurvivors -- not to improve insurance company profits,\u201d said\nDaniel Akaka, chairman of the Senate  Committee  on  Veterans\nAffairs  and a Hawaii Democrat.  \n \u2018Outraged\u2019  \n House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bob Filner said\nhe was \u201coutraged\u201d that insurance practices appear to result in\n\u201ccorporations retaining the assets in corporate accounts,\nprofiting from the interest, and failing to pass accrued\ninterest to surviving families.\u201d The California Democrat said\nVA officials should \u201cdemand answers\u201d about the program.  \n The White House \u201csupports the VA\u2019s immediate investigation\ninto these unacceptable insurance companies\u2019 practices,\u201d\nspokesman Nick Shapiro said in a statement yesterday. President\n Barack Obama  \u201cis committed to fulfilling America\u2019s\nresponsibility to our armed forces and their families,\u201d Shapiro\nsaid.  \n Survivors are told the death benefit is being placed in a\nsecure interest-bearing account, and they are given what the\ncompany calls a \u201ccheckbook\u201d to spend the money when they want.  \n In fact, insurers place the so-called retained-asset\naccounts in their own general corporate accounts and keep most\nof the investment earnings. The money isn\u2019t guaranteed by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., and the \u201cchecks\u201d are IOUs for\nmoney in the insurer\u2019s account.  \n \u2018Holding Back\u2019  \n \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, particularly in the case of dead\nsoldiers, for insurance companies to be holding back\u201d money\nfrom survivors,  Robert Hunter , Director of Insurance for the\n Consumer Federation of America , said in a telephone interview.  \n State insurance commissioners \u201cshould outlaw this\npractice. They have the power to do it -- they can say this is\nan unfair trade practice,\u201d said Hunter, a former Texas\ninsurance commissioner.  \n The New York State Insurance Department  will review the\nlegality of the practice, Deputy Superintendent Matthew Gaul\nsaid yesterday. Pentagon spokesman  Geoff Morrell  said yesterday\nhe had no comment.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s deeply upsetting that any company would attempt to\nimproperly profit off of the benefits given to the families of\nfallen soldiers,\u201d said Senator  Patty Murray , a Washington\nDemocrat and a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee.  \n The American  Council of Life Insurers  released a statement\nsaying retained-asset accounts help survivors.  \n \u2018Significant Benefit\u2019  \n \u201cRetained-asset accounts provide a significant benefit to\nfamily members who are dealing with the emotional loss of a\nloved one,\u201d the council said. \u201cFinancial matters may not be\nthe first thing on their minds and retained-asset accounts\nprovide a secure place for life insurance policy proceeds to be\nheld until the money is needed.\u201d  \n Insurers are holding onto at least $28 billion owed to\nsurvivors, according to three firms that handle the retained-\nasset accounts for about 130 life insurance companies.  \n House Armed Services Committee Chairman  Ike Skelton , a\nMissouri Democrat, said U.S. troops\u2019 survivors must be provided\nmore information about how to handle death benefits. He said\ninsurance companies should be examined to \u201cmake sure they\naren\u2019t misrepresenting the options being offered to surviving\nfamily members.\u201d  \n Skelton said his committee will \u201cassist in finding a\nremedy for this problem.\u201d  \n $1 Billion  \n Since 1999, the VA has allowed  Newark , New Jersey-based\nPrudential to use this procedure in providing benefits to\nsurvivors of fallen soldiers. In 2009, the families of U.S.\nsoldiers and veterans were supposed to be paid death benefits\ntotaling $1 billion immediately, according to their insurance\npolicies. They weren\u2019t.  \n In 2008, Prudential paid survivors 1 percent interest on\ntheir accounts, while it earned a 4.8 percent return on its\ncorporate funds, according to regulatory filings.  \n Prudential spokesman  Bob DeFillippo  said the company\u2019s\nAlliance Account is lawful and is an aid to soldiers\u2019 families.\nMetLife spokesman Joseph Madden said customers are happy with\nthe Total Control Account.  \n \u201cThe TCA affords beneficiaries security, peace of mind and\ntime to make an informed decision -- while earning interest in\nthe interim,\u201d Madden said.  \n Hunter said the VA and Pentagon should provide accurate\ninformation on the accounts to military personnel and should\n\u201coutlaw any insurance company that uses this practice\u201d from\nusing any military facilities to sell the product.  \n The quasi-banking system operated by insurers has none of\nthe protections of the actual banking system, and the financial\nregulation overhaul signed by Obama on July 21 didn\u2019t address\nit.  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\nTony Capaccio in Washington at \n acapaccio@bloomberg.net ;\nDavid Evans in  Los Angeles  at \n davidevans@bloomberg.net   \n To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nMark Silva at \n msilva@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                                                 \n                     \n                     Enlarge image \n                     \n                     \n                       Veterans Agency to Probe Insurer Handling Soldiers\u2019 Benefits  \n                       \n                         \n                           Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images \n                         \n                         House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bob Filner said he was \u201coutraged\u201d that insurance practices appear to result in \u201ccorporations retaining the assets in corporate accounts, profiting from the interest, and failing to pass accrued interest to surviving families.\u201d \n                       \n                     \n                                        \n           \n                     House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bob Filner said he was \u201coutraged\u201d that insurance practices appear to result in \u201ccorporations retaining the assets in corporate accounts, profiting from the interest, and failing to pass accrued interest to surviving families.\u201d Photographer: Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images  \n                   \n    \n\n                 \n           \n                           \n                 \n                 \n                                       \n                                   \n               \n                        \n           \n                          July 28 (Bloomberg) -- David Evans talks with Bloomberg's Scarlet Fu about his investigation into retained-asset accounts by life insurers and how the insurers profit from these accounts at the expense of grieving families.
