 "context": "The following article called 'Executive Lived in `Lap of Luxury' on Lam, Marshal Says' was published on 2010-10-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRebecca Parrett , a former National\nCentury Financial Enterprises Inc. executive who fled the U.S.\nto avoid a 25-year prison term, was arrested in a Mexican resort\ntown where she liked to dance, a U.S. official said.  Parrett, 62, was picked up yesterday by Mexican immigration\nauthorities in Ajijic, Jalisco, Deputy U.S. Marshal Brian\nBabtist said today. Parrett was convicted in Columbus, Ohio, in\nMarch 2008 for her role in a $2.9 billion fraud. Days later,\nwhile out on bail, she fled her home in Carefree, Arizona. She\nwas declared a fugitive and sentenced in absentia in March 2009.  \u201cShe was living in the lap of luxury,\u201d Babtist said in a\ntelephone interview from Columbus. \u201cShe was having fun, telling\npeople that she was an American who had testified against\nseveral people in a large white-collar crime case. She was\ntrying to stay anonymous and using an alias.\u201d  Parrett was flown yesterday from Guadalajara to Los\nAngeles, where she was arrested on a warrant, he said.  U.S. Magistrate Judge  Jacqueline Chooljian , at a hearing\ntoday in federal court in Los Angeles, ordered Parrett to be\ndetained and transferred to Columbus. Parrett, who was\nrepresented by a public defender, waived her right to an\nidentity hearing in Los Angeles.  She was convicted with four other executives in 2008 of\nfraud, money laundering and conspiracy. She was also ordered to\npay $2.38 billion in restitution. Parrett, a former vice\nchairman, secretary and treasurer, was one of 10 executives who\nwere convicted at trial or pleaded guilty.  Anti-Aging Treatments  \u201cI\u2019ve heard that she liked to go out dancing,\u201d Babtist\nsaid. \u201cShe was getting treatments from a Mexican anti-aging\ndoctor regularly. For somebody who\u2019s on the run, it was pretty\ngood.\u201d  Agents had long suspected that Parrett was in Mexico,\nBabtist said. \u201cIt was a matter of narrowing down the search and\nactually pinpointing the location,\u201d he said.  Ajijic is on the north shore of  Lake Chapala .  \u201cThe Marshals Service has followed all leads and devoted\ncountless hours to the search for Parrett,\u201d  Carter M. Stewart ,\nthe U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a\nstatement.  In July, Parrett\u2019s sister, Linda Case, was sentenced to six\nmonths in prison followed by eight months of home confinement\nfor lying to authorities about her whereabouts.  Unpaid Bills  National Century, based in Dublin, Ohio, helped hospitals\nand medical groups raise money by buying their unpaid insurance\nbills. The company then sold bonds that were supposed to be\nbacked by those receivables. The receivables were often\nworthless, prosecutors said. The company filed for bankruptcy in\nNovember 2002.  National Century\u2019s collapse hastened the bankruptcies of\n275 hospitals, clinics and other health-care providers,\nauthorities said. Victims included Pacific Investment Management\nCo., the world\u2019s largest bond fund.  Pimco  lost $283 million and\n Credit Suisse Group AG  lost $257 million, prosecutors said.  Former National Century Chief Executive Officer  Lance Poulsen , who founded the company, received a 30-year sentence.\nHe has appealed the sentence and conviction.  Parrett, who left her sixth husband in Carefree, was the\nsubject of a multistate search by U.S. marshals. She was\n featured  on the website of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted,\u201d News\nCorp.\u2019s Fox television show about fugitives.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  agreed to pay $425 million in 2006 to\nsettle claims by National Century noteholders in Arizona. The\nnoteholders said JPMorgan and other banks underwrote or were\ntrustees of the notes used to defraud investors.  Babtist couldn\u2019t say how Parrett financed her life on the\nrun. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the money came from, whether she was\ngetting outside help or she was using the stolen funds from the\nfraud case,\u201d he said.  The case is U.S. v. Poulsen, 06-129, U.S. District Court,\nSouthern District of Ohio (Columbus).
