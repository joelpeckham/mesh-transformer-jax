(MAT) , the world\u2019s largest\ntoymaker, is reviewing working conditions at a handful of\nChinese suppliers after a labor advocate reported abuses.  China Labor Watch, based in New York, released a 94-page\n report  yesterday that listed infractions at six Chinese\nfactories that make toys for Mattel, including underpaying\nworkers and fire hazards such as blocked escape routes and\nlocked emergency exits.  \u201cAs we do with any potential compliance issue, we are now\nfully reviewing the validity of the issues raised in the\nreport,\u201d Alan Hilowitz, a spokesman for El Segundo, California-based Mattel said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cShould our review\nprocess identify areas in need of improvement, we will act\nimmediately\u201d to address them.  Labor practices in  Asia  have come under increasing scrutiny\nfollowing suicides at electronics suppliers in China and a\nbuilding collapse in  Bangladesh  that killed more than 1,100\npeople. China Labor Watch has previously spoken out on the labor\npractices of companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple\nInc. supplier Foxconn Technology Group.  This is not the first time China Labor Watch has criticized\nMattel, the maker of Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toy cars. The\ngroup published a report last November claiming there were labor\nabuses at four factories that make products for the toymaker,\nincluding one owned by Mattel. At the time, Mattel said it was\ninvestigating the allegations. According to yesterday\u2019s report,\nMattel later told  China  Labor Watch in a letter that \u201cwith few\nexceptions the allegations are unfounded.\u201d  Hilowitz, the Mattel spokesman, couldn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to how Mattel handled last year\u2019s report.  Undercover Investigators  This current probe spanned six months and involved\nundercover investigators and interviews with more than 300\nworkers to reach its findings, the group said.  The report named 18 sets of legal and ethical violations,\nincluding shifts as long as 13 hours and overcrowded employee\ndorms that housed as many as 12 people in a single room. China\nLabor Watch reports that over the course of one year, the six\nfactories underpaid workers by as much as $11 million.  The toymaker earlier today reported net income in the three\nmonths ended Sept. 30 rose 16 percent to $422.8 million, or\n$1.21 a share, beating analysts\u2019 expectations.  Mattel rose 1 percent to $41.97 in  New York  after earlier\ntouching $43.74 for the largest intraday gain since April 17.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Mattel\u2019s review of the\nallegations earlier today.
