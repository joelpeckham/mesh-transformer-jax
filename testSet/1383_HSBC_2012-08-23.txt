The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapanese  stocks  gained, with the\n Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rising to a 15-week high, after a\nsurvey indicated China\u2019s manufacturing may contract at a faster\npace in August, boosting prospects for stimulus.

(7201) , a carmaker that gets almost half of\nits sales in  North America  and Europe, slid 0.6 percent after\nthe yen gained, cutting exporters\u2019 outlook. Sharp Corp. rose 1.1\npercent on speculation it may sell its shares in audio-equipment\nmaker  Pioneer Corp. (6773) , the biggest decliner on the Nikkei 225\ntoday.

The possible contraction in manufacturing \u201cmay boost\ninvestors\u2019 expectations that China will step up its stimulus\nmeasures to expand domestic demand,\u201d said Kaori Murai, a\nstrategist at Okasan Securities Co., a brokerage affiliate of\nSumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc.  The 47.8 preliminary reading for the purchasing managers\u2019\nindex released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today\ncompares with a final 49.3 for July. A number below 50 indicates\ncontraction. The gauge hasn\u2019t shown an expansion since October.  Daikin gained 2 percent to 2,159 yen. Nippon Chemi-Con\nCorp., a condenser maker that counts China as its biggest market,\nincreased 2.4 percent to 171 yen.  Policy Accommodation  Shares also climbed after Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago\nPresident  Charles Evans  said easier monetary policy around the\nworld, including in China, would support growth, broadening his\ncall for more stimulus in the U.S. People\u2019s Bank of China\nGovernor Zhou Xiaochuan yesterday said adjustments to  interest\nrates  and bank reserve requirements are still possible after the\ncentral bank stepped up temporary cash injections this month.

A number less than one means companies can be bought for\nless than the value of their assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The gauge\nrose less than 0.1 percent yesterday, reversing a 0.5 percent\ndrop after the Federal Reserve minutes were released in\nWashington.

Fed officials next meet\non Sept. 12-13.  \u201cThe fact that the Fed is rushing to ease policy is in\nindication of the downside risks the economy faces,\u201d  Akio\nYoshino , who helps oversee the equivalent of $32 billion as\nchief economist at Amundi Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. \u201cAnd it suggests\nthat the Fed thinks the  U.S. economy  may not achieve the bank\u2019s\nforecast for mid-range 2 percent growth. That means companies\nwon\u2019t see profits gaining from their U.S. operations.\u201d  Nissan Declines  Nissan lost 0.6 percent to 777 yen.  Kawasaki Heavy\nIndustries Ltd. (7012) , a heavy machinery maker that gets almost 30\npercent of its sales from the U.S. and Europe, sank 1.6 percent\nto 180 yen.
