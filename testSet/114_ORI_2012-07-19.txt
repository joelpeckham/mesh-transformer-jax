 "context": "The following article called 'AIG Scorned by Old Republic for Insuring Homes Loans: Mortgages' was published on 2012-07-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmerican International Group Inc. (AIG) ,\nthe insurer bailed out by U.S. taxpayers, is investing in home-\nloan insurance, a business that Aldo Zucaro, chief executive\nofficer of rival  Old Republic International Corp. (ORI) , said doesn\u2019t\nmake sense.  United Guaranty , acquired by AIG in 1981, backs mortgages\nagainst losses and is seeking growth after hiring Donna DeMaio\nfrom MetLife Inc. in May. Zucaro questioned the industry\u2019s\nprospects after failing to separate his company from a mortgage-\nguaranty unit that he said may be unprofitable into 2014.  \u201cIf all you\u2019re doing is looking at the past, yeah, clearly\nit\u2019s a crappy business,\u201d Mark Devries, an analyst at Barclays\nPlc, said by phone. \u201cFor those who survive and are there, it\u2019s\ngoing to be the most attractive environment to write  mortgage\ninsurance  that we\u2019ve seen for at least a decade and a half.\u201d  Tighter lending standards by banks and an improving housing\nmarket, with prices stabilizing and home sales close to two-year\nhighs, mean the business is vastly different than in the years\nfollowing the housing market crash that started in 2006.\nMortgage insurer losses mounted in subsequent years as  home\nprices  fell as much as 34 percent and delinquencies surpassed 10\npercent, while 4.7 million homeowners lost their properties to\nforeclosure, according to RealtyTrac Inc. data.  Old Republic posted pretax losses of more than $2 billion\nfrom mortgage-guaranty operations in the five years ended Dec.\n31, while AIG\u2019s business backing home loans had a pretax loss of\n$4.5 billion in the period. AIG, buoyed by U.S. rescue funds and\nreturns from one of the world\u2019s largest commercial insurers, can\npursue growth while the accumulated shortfall and a refusal by\nmortgage buyer  Fannie Mae  to accept Old Republic policies has\nprevented Zucaro from writing new policies that may be more\nprofitable.  Genworth, MGIC  Devries estimates that firms that stay in the business may\nbenefit from a return on equity above 20 percent on new coverage\nas the exit of some rivals allows remaining insurers to boost\nprices, and tighter underwriting standards limit claims.  AIG competes with rivals led by Genworth Financial Inc.,\nMGIC Investment Corp. and  Radian Group Inc. (RDN)   Shares of all four\nof the companies plunged more than 80 percent in  New York \ntrading since the end of 2006. At least two smaller closely held\nfirms were founded after housing prices crashed.  Mortgage insurance is typically paid for by borrowers,\npicked by lenders and required for debt exceeding 80 percent of\na property\u2019s value. The policies cover  foreclosure  losses and\nrepresent a separate business from mortgage-bond guarantees\nprovided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Market Share  The market share of private companies in mortgage insurance\nfell to 22 percent last year from more than 75 percent in 2007\nafter losses drained capital at the firms and government\nagencies such as the  Federal Housing Administration  took a\ngreater role, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Radian sold\nthe most private mortgage insurance in the first three months of\nthis year, followed by AIG,  MGIC (MTG)  and Genworth.  Old Republic opted against contributing the capital that\nwould be required by regulators to sell more mortgage insurance.\nZucaro will collect premiums and pay claims on mortgage policies\nsold in prior years while directing resources to more profitable\nlines such as  title insurance  and commercial coverage.  \u2018Sobering Facts\u2019  Accumulated losses that wiped out about 80 percent of\nChicago-based Old Republic\u2019s mortgage-guaranty profits since it\nentered the business more than 30 years ago are \u201csobering facts\nthat bring into question the very rationales of the MI business\nmodel,\u201d Zucaro said on a conference call last month. \u201cOur\nmortgage-guaranty segment has spilled a lot of red ink.\u201d  Zucaro had planned to spin off the mortgage unit in a move\nthat would have isolated the parent company from losses. He\ncanceled the plan June 22 after objections from stakeholders, a\ngroup that he said includes regulators, banks and  bond holders .  The shares plunged 21 percent since June 21, while prices\non $550 million of 3.75 percent convertible bonds dropped to 91\ncents on the dollar yesterday from 100 cents. Moody\u2019s Investors\nService downgraded the company\u2019s  debt  to Baa3, one level above\njunk.  United Guaranty can expand as the U.S. reduces its role in\nthe housing market, AIG CEO  Robert Benmosche  said on an Aug. 5\nconference call. The unit is pricing individual policies based\non risk and provides insight into the economy, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s running very well and it\u2019s enhancing whatever we do\nhere,\u201d Benmosche said. \u201cWe see it as a keeper.\u201d  \u2018Major Asset\u2019  The unit accounted for $8 million of pretax income in the\nfirst quarter as AIG posted net income of  $3.21 billion , the\ncompany said in May. DeMaio, previously the CEO of MetLife Bank,\nwas hired that month as chief operating officer of United\nGuaranty to oversee sales, underwriting and loss management.  \u201cHer experience in leading fast-growing organizations will\nbe a major asset as we build upon United Guaranty\u2019s position,\u201d\nUnited Guaranty CEO Kim Garland said in a May 11 statement. Jim Ankner, a spokesman for AIG, had no additional comment.  United Guaranty has been able to write new coverage in\npart because AIG helped absorb losses, said Helen Remeza, an\nanalyst at Moody\u2019s. AIG, once the world\u2019s largest insurer,\nreceived a bailout in 2008 that grew to $182.3 billion. The firm\ntapped a U.S. Treasury Department facility for $2.1 billion in\n2009 in part to help restructure United Guaranty, AIG said in a\nfiling that year.  Genworth is working to \u201cstrengthen our  capital structure \nand realign our business portfolio,\u201d acting CEO Martin Klein\nwrote in a letter last month after Moody\u2019s said the company was\nbeing reviewed for a downgrade, in part because of U.S. mortgage\ninsurance. The company also backs home loans in  Australia (GNW)  and\nCanada and sells life insurance, long-term care coverage and\nretirement products in the U.S.  \u2018Significant Losses\u2019  New policies are more profitable and will help rebuild\ncapital, said S.A. Ibrahim, CEO of Philadelphia-based Radian.\nHe\u2019s said the mortgage insurance business may become profitable\nas soon as 2013.  \u201cWe as a company and our  shareholders  have borne\nsignificant losses, but this is an industry that is still\nstanding,\u201d Ibrahim said. \u201cEach piece of new business we write,\nif it\u2019s profitable and well written, creates a greater ability\nto pay our obligations to the legacy policyholders.\u201d  FBR & Co. said in April that it raised $550 million to fund\nNMI Holdings Inc., a planned mortgage insurer. Essent Guaranty\nInc., backed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Goldman Sachs Group\nInc. (GS) , was  approved  as a qualified insurer by government-\nsponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  in 2010.  The  Federal Housing Finance Agency , the overseer of Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac, which were seized by the U.S. in 2008, is\nstudying ways for the private sector to share housing risk,\naccording to an FHFA  strategic plan .  Political Support  \u201cMortgage insurance has to exist and, given the political\nsupport for housing in this country, I think we\u2019ll get a\nsolution,\u201d said Jason Stewart, managing director at Compass\nPoint Research & Trading LLC. in Washington. \u201cThe average\nhomeowner has nowhere near enough savings or earnings capacity\nto put down a down payment\u201d that a lender would be willing to\naccept without third-party backing.  Thomas Lawler, a former Fannie Mae economist who runs\nLawler Economic & Housing Consulting, said the role of private\nfirms is tied to the mandate by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for\ninsurance on most low-down-payment loans, a policy that could be\nchanged by the government.  \u2018Something Big\u2019  \u201cIt was the GSE legislation that really transformed the\nmortgage insurance industry into something big, because it was a\nrequirement,\u201d Lawler said. Changing the enterprises \u201cmeans\nthat the industry itself could shrink.\u201d  Mortgage insurance volume may also decline if risk-\nretention rules stemming from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, don\u2019t\ngive lenders a benefit for loans that carry it, he said.  The housing crash calls into question the viability of\ninsurers that rely mostly on backing mortgages, Lawler said.\nLarger companies like AIG can better bear the risk, he said.  \u201cIf you look at the mortgage insurers today, they are\nstill generating substantial losses from their legacy books,\u201d\nsaid Stanislas Rouyer, associate managing director at Moody\u2019s.\n\u201cThe opportunities for new business, while attractive given the\nquality of the loans that are being insured, the volume is not\nsufficient at this point to cover the losses that are still\nemerging.\u201d  PMI Group Inc. (PPMIQ)  filed for  bankruptcy protection  in November\nand  Triad Guaranty Inc. (TGIC)  stopped selling new policies in 2008 as\ncapital ran short. Triad traded over the counter for 6.5 cents a\nshare yesterday, down from a 2004 high of more than $60.  Radian and Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based MGIC have said they\nmay fail to meet regulatory limits on risk relative to capital\nin the second half of this year and have received permission\nfrom some state regulators to continue selling policies if they\nbreach the standards.  Michael Zimmerman, senior vice president of  investor\nrelations  at MGIC, declined to comment.
