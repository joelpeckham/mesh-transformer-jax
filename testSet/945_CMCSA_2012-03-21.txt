 "context": "The following article called 'Verizon\u2019s Deal With Cable May Be Truce of Rivals, Kohl Says' was published on 2012-03-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVerizon Wireless \u2019s deals to buy\nairwaves from cable companies and cooperate with them may amount\nto a \u201ctruce\u201d among rivals at the expense of consumers, a\nlawmaker examining the transactions said.  U.S. Senator  Herb Kohl , speaking at a hearing today, urged\nregulators to ensure the arrangements don\u2019t \u201creverse the\nhistoric gains in competition between phone and cable\ncompanies\u201d over the past 15 years.  Verizon, the largest mobile provider in the U.S., in\nDecember announced a deal to pay $3.6 billion for unused\nairwaves from a group including  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S.\ncable provider, and No. 2  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  The companies\nalso agreed to market one another\u2019s services.  The transactions would solve a critical need for more\nairwaves without reducing competition, Randal Milch, general\ncounsel of the wireless company\u2019s parent,  Verizon Communications\nInc. (VZ) , said in testimony submitted to the antitrust panel\nyesterday.  Opponents have said the accords would result in less\ncompetition and higher prices.  \u201cThe fundamental question we must answer is whether these\ndeals will bring beneficial new choices to consumers, or amount\nto previously fierce rivals standing down from competition,\u201d\nKohl, a Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of the subcommittee,\nsaid.  \u2018Encourage Innovation\u2019  Senator  Mike Lee  of  Utah , the subcommittee\u2019s top\nRepublican, said the marketing agreements \u201cmay likely be seen\nas pro-competitive deals that encourage innovation\u201d unless\ncontrary evidence emerges.  \u201cRegulators must take care to make good use of spectrum\nand not penalize private enterprise,\u201d Lee said.  The  Justice Department  and Federal Communications\nCommission are examining the proposal, and a similar $315\nmillion agreement between Verizon Wireless and  Cox\nCommunications Inc. (COX)  Both agencies must approve the transactions\nbefore they can close.  Today\u2019s session carried the title, \u201cThe Verizon/Cable\nDeals: Harmless Collaboration or a Threat to Competition and\nConsumers?\u201d It was held by the Judiciary Committee\u2019s\nSubcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer\nRights.  Influence Over Agencies  Senators don\u2019t vote on mergers. They do have influence over\nthe agencies that decide whether deals can go ahead. Kohl last\nyear urged regulators to block  AT&T Inc. (T)  from buying  T-Mobile\nUSA Inc. (166783Q) , and AT&T abandoned the deal after the Justice\nDepartment sued to block it.  Verizon Wireless wants airwaves to help meet demand that\u2019s\nsoaring as consumers buy more smartphones and data-hungry tablet\ncomputers such as Apple Inc.\u2019s iPad. Basking Ridge, New Jersey-\nbased Verizon Wireless is 55 percent-owned by Verizon and 45\npercent-owned by  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , based in Newbury, U.K.  The deal would create an \u201cunchecked monopoly by the\nnation\u2019s largest cable and wireless companies,\u201d the\n Communications Workers of America  and the International\nBrotherhood of Electrical Workers said yesterday in a statement.  Verizon Communications will retain \u201cevery incentive\u201d to\ncompete against cable companies with its FiOS high-speed wired\nservice, Milch said in his testimony. More than 85 percent of\nhouseholds served by the cable companies aren\u2019t in areas reached\nby FiOS, he said.  \u2018Compete Vigorously\u2019  \u201cNo one is constrained,\u201d Milch told senators today.\n\u201cFiOS will be selling through its channels and I assume Comcast\nwill continue to compete vigorously as well.\u201d  The cable companies decided not to build wireless networks\nbefore the agreements, and Verizon decided not to expand FiOS\nbefore the deal, Comcast Executive Vice President  David Cohen \nsaid in written testimony.  Comcast talked with \u201cvirtually every other wireless\nprovider\u201d before agreeing to sell airwaves to Verizon, Cohen\nsaid today. Discussions with T-Mobile stopped before the fourth-\nlargest U.S. mobile carrier agreed in March 2011 to its ill-\nfated merger with No. 2 AT&T, Cohen said.  The airwaves and marketing accords \u201caren\u2019t contingent upon\none another,\u201d Milch said and Cohen agreed that there\u2019s no legal\nconnection between them.
