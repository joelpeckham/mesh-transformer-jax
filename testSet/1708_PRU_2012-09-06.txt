The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmerican International Group Inc. (AIG) ,\nthe bailed-out U.S. insurer, is raising as much as $2 billion\nselling a stake in  AIA Group Ltd. (1299)  as the company seeks to\nrepurchase its stock from the U.S. Treasury Department.  AIG is offering about 600 million AIA shares at HK$26.30 to\nHK$26.50 ($3.39 to $3.42), above the mid-point of the original\nrange of HK$25.75 to HK$26.75, according to a term sheet\nobtained by  Bloomberg News . AIG plans to spend as much $5\nbillion buying back its shares, it said in a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , 68, is raising\nfunds to buy back stock of New York-based AIG from the U.S.,\nwhich still has a  stake  of 53 percent, about four years after a\ngovernment rescue. The Treasury has trimmed its holding from 92\npercent through four share sales, and a lockup period on the\nnext offering expired Sept. 2.  \u201cThe sale of only a partial stake of AIA and only $5\nbillion of potential buybacks leaves us underwhelmed,\u201d Sterne\nAgee & Leach Inc. analysts led by  John Nadel  said in a note to\nclients. \u201cThe stock will come under considerable pressure given\nthe much-lower-than-expected buybacks from Treasury near-term.\u201d  AIG fell 1.8 percent to $34.18 at 10:20 a.m. in New York,\nthe only  decliner  on the 22-company Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\nInsurance Index. The shares have gained 47 percent this year.  This is the third time that AIG has offered shares of AIA,\nthe third-largest Asia-based insurer by market value. The sale\nwill leave AIG with a 13.6 percent stake in the Hong Kong-based\ncompany.  Selling Down  AIG cut its AIA holdings to 33 percent in a 2010 offering\nthat raised about $20.5 billion and priced AIA shares at\nHK$19.68. AIG sold $6 billion more in March, with shares priced\nat HK$27.15.  AIG is offering the shares at a 2.1 percent discount to a\n1.7 percent premium to AIA\u2019s closing price of HK$26.30 today,\naccording to the term sheet. It is restricted from selling the\nremaining AIA shares in the next 90 days.  \u201cInvestors are willing to buy a small lot\u201d given the\ncurrent market conditions, said Kenneth Yue, a Hong Kong-based\nanalyst at CCB International Securities Ltd., of AIG\u2019s decision\nnot to sell all remaining shares at once.  A larger share sale would probably involve a higher\ndiscount, affecting AIA\u2019s share price, Yue said in a phone\ninterview. AIA fell 8.4 percent the day after AIG sold 1.72\nbillion shares at HK $27.15 on March 5.  \u2018Minimal Discount\u2019  \u201cAIG in a way is trying to sell the stake with a minimal\ndiscount and support AIA\u2019s share price,\u201d Yue said.  The  price range  may indicate the share sale is in good\ndemand from investors, said Yue, who has a neutral rating on AIA\nwith a price target of HK$29.  Yue said he expected AIG to sell some of its remaining AIA\nshares after the 90-day lockup and reduce its holding below 5\npercent in about 180 days.  AIA has repositioned itself as an independent insurer after\nlosing share of new business during the global financial crisis\nbecause of ties to AIG, which would have collapsed without\ngovernment aid. AIA, the third-largest Asia-based insurer by\nmarket value, has delivered eight straight quarters of growth in\nthe value of new business under CEO  Mark Tucker , who was hired\nby Benmosche in July 2010.  \u201cMark Tucker has done an outstanding job,\u201d Benmosche said\non an Aug. 3 conference call. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the right time\nand the right price to monetize our ownership of AIA.\u201d  Rivals Expand  The bailout forced AIG to scale back in  Asia , while rivals\nincluding  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  expanded on\nthe continent by buying units from Benmosche. AIA operates in\nmarkets including  Hong Kong ,  Thailand , China,  Singapore ,\n Malaysia  and South Korea. Maurice \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg, who had\nbuilt AIG during his four-decade leadership of the firm until\n2005, called AIA one of his company\u2019s \u201ccrown jewels.\u201d  The sale of AIA shares and the wind-down of two bailout\nvehicles holding mortgage debt will reduce volatility in AIG\u2019s\n earnings , which had swung with fluctuations in the market value\nof the assets. Benmosche is seeking to focus on global property-\ncasualty coverage and U.S. life insurance and retirement\nproducts.  Benmosche turned to public offerings to divest AIA after\nthe collapse in 2010 of a deal to sell the insurer to  Prudential\nPlc (PRU)  for about $35.5 billion. The London-based company sought a\nlower price under pressure from its shareholders, and AIG\u2019s\nboard rejected a reduced bid that Benmosche supported, people\nfamiliar with the discussions have said. The clash led to the\ndeparture of AIG Chairman  Harvey Golub  in 2010.
