The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n* RBA interest rate decision due later in the day\n* BHP Billiton biggest boost to Australia\u2019s benchmark index\n* Gains largely broad-based in NZ\nBy Christina Martin\nMarch 6 (Reuters) - Australian shares bounced off four straight sessions of declines on Tuesday, with the materials and financial sectors outperforming, taking their cue from a jump in oil prices and an upbeat U.S. market.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 index rose 1.3 percent, or 74.5 points, to 5,969.5 by 1252 GMT, gaining most in nearly four weeks. The benchmark closed down 0.6 percent on Monday.\nCrude prices thrived on forecasts for robust oil demand growth and concerns that output from OPEC producers would grow at a much slower pace in coming years, lending support to the materials and energy sectors.\nThe metals and mining index gained as much as 2.4 percent to mark its biggest intraday percentage gain in more than two weeks.\nBHP Billiton Ltd rose more than 3 percent, making it the top advancer on the main index, while fellow heavyweight Rio Tinto Ltd scaled up 0.9 percent.\nPemex, Mexico\u2019s state-run oil company, plans to reach out to BHP among others to form new joint ventures for two deepwater blocks it won in a January auction.\nFinancial stocks rose as much as 1.1 percent, with the \u2018Big Four\u2019 banks adding between 0.1 percent and 1.1 percent, following a rally in U.S. stocks. Investors moved to the view that Trump\u2019s tariffs threat was a negotiating tool after he tweeted that Canada and Mexico could avoid his proposed tariffs if they ceded ground in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks.\n\u201cThere is a bit of hope given what we have heard from the U.S. President that the tariffs may be linked to NAFTA negotiations and may not actually proceed. Now that\u2019s not clear-cut obviously; if we get more clarity going the other way, the markets might reverse,\u201d said Mathan Somasundaram, market portfolio strategist at Blue Ocean Equities.\n\u201cI think there is still substantial risk in the market but in the shorter term, I think the market is assuming a bit more positive approach to the tariffs so we\u2019ve seen a bounce in the U.S. markets and that is flowing through to Australia.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s central bank is seen as all but certain to keep its cash rate at a record low of 1.5 percent at its monthly policy meeting next week, a Reuters poll of economists found.\nAmong top gainers on the main index was telecom operator Telstra Corp Ltd, up as much as more than 2 percent, its biggest intraday percentage gain in nearly five weeks.\nTelstra confirmed a deal with News Corp to combine Foxtel and Fox Sports Australia, two months after Australia\u2019s competition watchdog dropped its opposition to the merger.\nNew Zealand\u2019s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index also edged higher, up 0.4 percent, or 35.83 points, to 8,315.66.\nUtility, healthcare and materials stocks led the gains on the index, with construction materials maker Fletcher Building Ltd being the best performer, rising as much as 3.5 percent to its highest in almost two weeks.\nReeling from spiralling costs and deep losses in major projects, New Zealand\u2019s second-largest company by revenue, flagged in February that losses were NZ$660 million, even larger than anticipated last year, and that it was exiting the commercial construction business.\nReporting by Christina Martin in Bengaluru Editing by Eric Meijer\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ritchie Bros.
