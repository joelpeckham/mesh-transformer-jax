The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina  is at risk of falling into a\nrecession by 2015 that would reduce commodity prices as much as\n70 percent, according to the chief executive officer at Smead\nCapital Management Inc.  Commodities from  copper  to crude oil may drop 50 percent to\n70 percent from current prices in three years to five years,\nBill Smead, CEO of the Seattle-based mutual fund, said in an\ninterview in  Singapore . China, the world\u2019s biggest consumer of\nenergy, metals and grains, has a 30 percent chance of slipping\ninto a recession as property prices fall, hurting local banks\nthat made loans to developers and home buyers, he said.  Smead, whose fund manages $170 million and has stakes in\n Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ,  McDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD)  and  Bank of New York Mellon\nCorp. , doesn\u2019t own natural-resource companies because commodity\nprices are \u201cmassively overvalued,\u201d he said. The fund reported\nnet capital appreciation of 5.2 percent last year, compared with\na 0.4 percent gain of the Russell 1000 Value Total Returns Index\nand a 2.1 percent rise in the S&P 500 Total Returns Index.  \u201cCommodities are currently 50 to 70 percent above their\ncost of production,\u201d Smead said. \u201cHistory shows prices tend to\nbottom near the production cost. That\u2019s at about $50 to $55 a\nbarrel for crude oil.\u201d  Companies and banks that financed China\u2019s construction boom,\nwhich started in 2008, show signs of accumulating more debt than\nthey can pay off, he said. China\u2019s government debt, which may\nhave risen to 20 trillion yuan ($3.14 trillion) by the end of\n2010, or about 50 percent of its gross domestic product, is\nbecoming a major constraint on its economic growth, research\nfirm Beijing Fost Economic Consulting Company Ltd. said in\nDecember.  \u2018Woefully Undercapitalized\u2019  China\u2019s exports fell 0.5 percent from a year earlier in\nJanuary, the customs bureau said today on its website. Imports\ndropped 15.3 percent, declining more than the 3.6 percent\nforecast by economists. Car passenger-vehicle sales in the\ncountry, the world\u2019s biggest auto market, dropped 24 percent\nfrom a year earlier to 1.16 million units last month, the China\nAssociation of Automobile Manufacturers said in a statement\nyesterday.  \u201cLocal banks are woefully undercapitalized,\u201d Smead said.\n\u201cThey financed all these developers when it was all build,\nbuild, build, build, build. Now, all these buildings are coming\nup and nobody wants them.\u201d  Local governments in China, prohibited from directly taking\nbank loans or selling bonds, have set up more than 6,000\nfinancing companies to sidestep those rules and raise funds for\nbuilding stadiums, roads and bridges, the National Audit Office\nsaid in a June report.  Cleaning Out  Governments at provincial, city and county levels amassed\n10.7 trillion yuan of debt by the end of 2010, the auditor said.\n Home prices  fell for a fifth month in January, according to\nSouFun Holdings Ltd., the nation\u2019s biggest real-estate website\nowner that began compiling the figures in July 2010.  \u201cWe\u2019re not negative about the long-term prospects for the\nChinese economy,\u201d Smead said. \u201cBut what needs to happen for\nthe success story in China to continue is that they have to\nclean the system. And that\u2019s what a recession will do.\u201d  He recommends buying so-called custody banks like  Bank of\nNew York Mellon Corp. (BK)  and U.S. equities with low exposure to the\nChinese market.  \u201cIt\u2019s quite controversial of us to be positive on\nfinancial companies while  Ben Bernanke  has said interest rates\nwill remain low,\u201d said Cole Smead, director of marketing at the\nfund. \u201cBut when  interest rates  rise, money brokers will make\nmoney on people getting out of bonds.\u201d  The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI  gauge  of 24 commodities fell 0.1\npercent to 679.41 at 2:09 p.m. Singapore time. The index has\ngained 5.4 percent this year compared with 2011\u2019s annual\nincrease of 2.1 percent.
