 "context": "The following article called 'Sanofi Obtains EU Panel Recommendation for MS Tablet Aubagio' was published on 2013-03-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSanofi (SAN)  won backing from a European\nadvisory panel for its first multiple sclerosis therapy, the\ntablet Aubagio, a step forward in the French drugmaker\u2019s plan to\ngrab a slice of the $14 billion MS business.  Aubagio, a once-daily pill, was recommended for treatment\nof relapsing forms of the debilitating disease by the  European\nMedicines Agency\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human\nUse , the London-based agency said today. The committee decided\nthat the medicine\u2019s key ingredient, known as teriflunomide,\ncouldn\u2019t be considered as a new active substance, the EMA said.  The decision not to grant new active substance status to\nAubagio \u201cisn\u2019t likely to have much of an impact,\u201d Vincent Meunier, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris, who has a buy\nrecommendation on the stock, said in a phone interview today.\n\u201cThe one risk is that a company decides to work on a generic\nversion of the medicine, but Aubagio isn\u2019t a huge product for\nSanofi.\u201d  Sanofi won U.S. backing to sell the tablet in September.\nThe Paris-based company has been building up an MS business\nsince its 2011 purchase of the U.S. biotech company Genzyme\nCorp., which gave it access to Lemtrada, another experimental\ntreatment for the nerve-damaging illness. Sanofi needs new\nmedicines to help offset revenue losses from generic competition\nto best-sellers including the blood thinner Plavix.  Aubagio is meant to treat relapsing-remitting MS, the most\ncommon form of the illness.  \u2018Very Disappointed\u2019  \u201cWe are very disappointed by the CHMP opinion regarding\nnew active substance designation,\u201d David Meeker, the president\nand chief executive officer of Sanofi\u2019s Genzyme unit in\nCambridge,  Massachusetts , said in a statement. \u201cThis decision\ncould have a detrimental impact on future scientific innovation\nin MS.\u201d  Sanofi said it\u2019s planning to ask the EMA to re-examine the\ndesignation. The European Commission usually follows the panel\u2019s\nrecommendation.  MS affects more than 2.1 million people worldwide,\naccording to the  National Multiple Sclerosis Society . Patients\nwith RRMS get attacks that degrade their neurological function,\nfollowed by periods of recovery.  Flooded Market  Lemtrada is administered through infusions for five\nconsecutive days when treatment begins and for another three\ndays 12 months later. Patients probably will use Aubagio in the\nearlier phases of the disease, while Lemtrada is more likely to\nbe used at a more advanced stage, neurologists say.  Aubagio and Lemtrada will have to make inroads in a market\nflooded by new products, such as  Novartis AG (NOVN) \u2019s pill Gilenya.\n Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) \u2019s BG-12, also an oral treatment, is awaiting a\ndecision from U.S. regulators this month. The European panel\nrecommended its approval today.  Aubagio is a less compelling product than BG-12, Meunier\nsaid. He estimates Aubagio will garner about 300 million euros\n($389 million) in annual sales by 2016.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a great medicine,\u201d he said.  Aubagio will be an important treatment option for many MS\npatients because of its \u201cvery well characterized\u201d safety\nprofile, Michael Panzara, Genzyme\u2019s therapeutic area head for MS\nand immune diseases, said in an interview in September.  Multiple sclerosis is caused by an abnormal immune response\nthat attacks the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells\nin the brain and spinal cord. The assault stops nerve cells from\nsending signals, sapping patients\u2019 energy, blurring their vision\nand slowly robbing them of mobility, balance and coordination.  The market for MS drugs will grow to $19.6 billion annually\nby 2022 from $13.8 billion at present, Ravi Mehrotra and other\nCredit Suisse analysts predicted in an Oct. 8 note.  The EMA today also  confirmed  the CHMP\u2019s refusal to back\nSanofi and  Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ISIS) \u2019s Kynamro, a drug to treat\npatients with a rare disorder that causes run-away levels of the\nfat-like substance cholesterol. Sanofi had requested a re-\nexamination of the CHMP\u2019s initial negative opinion in December.
