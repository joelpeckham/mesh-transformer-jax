 "context": "The following article called 'JPMorgan Shares Tumble After $2B London Trading Loss' was published on 2012-05-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  fell the most in\nnine months after Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said the\nfirm suffered a $2 billion trading loss he attributed to\n\u201cegregious\u201d failures in a unit managing risks.  JPMorgan dropped 9.3 percent to $36.96 at 4:15 p.m. in New\nYork, marking the stock\u2019s biggest decline since Aug. 8 and the\nday\u2019s second-worst showing in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  The bank\u2019s chief investment office, run by Ina Drew, 55,\ntook flawed positions on synthetic credit securities that remain\nvolatile and may cost the lender an additional $1 billion this\nquarter or next, Dimon, 56, said yesterday in a conference call\nwith analysts. The loss originated out of the firm\u2019s  London  CIO\nunit, an executive at the bank said.  \u201cThere were many errors, sloppiness and bad judgment,\u201d\nDimon said. \u201cThese were egregious mistakes, they were self-\ninflicted.\u201d  The chief investment office was thrust into the debate over\nU.S. efforts to ban proprietary trading when Bloomberg News\nreported last month that the unit had taken bets so big that\nJPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, probably\ncouldn\u2019t unwind them without losing money or roiling financial\nmarkets. Dimon, 56, had transformed the unit in recent years to\nmake bigger and riskier speculative trades with the bank\u2019s\nmoney, five former employees said.  FSA Examination  The U.K.\u2019s Financial Services Authority, which regulates\nbanks, is examining the role London employees played in the\nloss, according to two people familiar with the talks. The\nagency hasn\u2019t opened a formal investigation and there was no\nevidence of criminal activity, these people said.  \u201cIt will weigh on the sector pretty bad,\u201d said  Paul Miller , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,\nVirginia. Miller and Christopher Mutascio at Stifel Nicolaus &\nCo. downgraded their recommendations on the shares today.\n\u201cInvestors are going to say that these are general big black\nboxes that can\u2019t be analyzed, not even the management companies\nunderstand what they\u2019re doing themselves.\u201d  Dimon had defended the chief investment office as a\n\u201csophisticated\u201d guardian of the bank\u2019s funds on an April 13\nconference call, calling news coverage \u201ca complete tempest in a\nteapot.\u201d On May 2, he led fellow Wall Street CEOs in a closed-\ndoor meeting to lobby the  Federal Reserve  about softening\nproposed U.S. reforms that might crimp their profits.  \u2018Bunch of Pundits\u2019  Yesterday, he said the timing of the trading blunders\n\u201cplays right into the hands of a bunch of pundits out there\u201d\nwho are pushing for a strict version of the proprietary trading\nban named for former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker .  Given Dimon\u2019s resistance to the ban and new regulations,\n\u201che\u2019s got a lot of egg on his face right now,\u201d said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the  University of Houston . \u201cAny\nchance they had of getting a relative loosening of Volcker rule,\nanything of that nature, that\u2019s out the window.\u201d  The chief investment office\u2019s push into risk-taking was led\nby Achilles Macris, 50, according to three former employees,\nBloomberg News reported on April 13. He was hired in 2006 as its\ntop executive in London and led an expansion into corporate and\nmortgage-debt investments with a mandate to generate profits for\nthe New York-based bank, they said. Dimon closely supervised the\ntransition from its previous focus on protecting JPMorgan from\nrisks inherent in its banking business, such as interest-rate\nand currency movements, they said.  \u2018Talented People\u2019  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it \u2018more aggressive,\u2019 I would call it\n\u2018better,\u2019\u201d Dimon told analysts yesterday. \u201cWe added different\ntypes of people, talented people and stuff like that.\u201d Until\nrecently, they were careful and successful, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s classic Wall Street hubris, which we\u2019ve seen so many\ntimes before,\u201d said  Simon Johnson , a former chief economist at\nthe  International Monetary Fund  who now teaches at the\n Massachusetts Institute of Technology . \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly\nironic here is that Jamie presents himself, and is believed by\nothers to be, the king of risk management.\u201d  Bloomberg News first reported April 5 that London-based\nJPMorgan trader Bruno Iksil had amassed positions linked to the\nfinancial health of corporations that were so large he was\ndriving price moves in the $10 trillion market.  The $2 billion loss occurred in London under multiple\ntraders, according to an executive at the bank, who spoke on the\ncondition of anonymity. Dimon wasn\u2019t immediately told about\ntheir shift in strategy and didn\u2019t know the magnitude of the\nlosses until after the company reported  earnings  April 13, the\nexecutive said. As the position deteriorated rapidly, the bank\ngathered internal analysts and examiners to investigate, and\nDimon grew more distressed by the day, the executive said.  \u2018Corrective Action\u2019  While no one has been fired yet, Dimon told analysts he\nwill take \u201ccorrective action.\u201d The bank is keeping employees\ninvolved on hand while it deals with the transactions, and some\nare likely to lose their jobs afterward, said an executive with\nknowledge of the situation. The bank is also reevaluating its\nrisk-monitoring team within the chief investment office, the\nperson said.  JPMorgan risks losing more money now because other market\nparticipants will figure out what the bank has to do to unload\nits position, said Charles Peabody, an analyst with Portales\nPartners LLC in  New York . Costs from the trades may affect\nearnings through the end of the year, he said.  Sharks to Blood  \u201cWhen there\u2019s blood in the water, the sharks are going to\nattack that animal,\u201d said Peabody, who downgraded his\nrecommendation on the stock in March to sector perform. \u201cIt\ncould make it very difficult for them to unwind a trade.\u201d  Investors bet more damage lies ahead. Bearish JPMorgan\noptions had the second-largest increase in trading among all\nU.S. stocks today as 418,892 puts to sell JPMorgan shares\nchanged hands. That was 12 times the four-week average and 1.4\ntimes the number of calls to buy, the data show. JPMorgan\u2019s June\n$35 puts were the most-traded options on the stock as they more\nthan tripled to 85 cents from a close of 26 cents yesterday.  More than 216 million JPMorgan shares traded, breaking the\nprior one-day record set in 2008.  Dimon declined on the call to discuss the specific\ntransactions or people involved. Synthetic credit products are\nderivatives that generate gains and losses tied to credit\nperformance without the owner buying or selling actual debt.\nJPMorgan used the instruments to hedge exposure on loans and\nother credit risks tied to corporations, banks and sovereign\ngovernments. The losses emerged after the firm tried to reduce\nthat position and unwind the portfolio, Dimon said.  The bank said losses were partly offset by gains from the\nsales from its available-for-sale credit portfolio, resulting in\na net loss for the firm\u2019s  corporate division , which includes the\nCIO, of about $800 million after taxes. Dimon said losses could\nwiden or narrow in coming weeks and months, and that he can\u2019t\nestimate potential costs.  Long-Term Holdings  As the bank repositions the synthetic credit portfolio, the\nchief investment office \u201cmay hold certain of its current\nsynthetic credit positions for the longer term,\u201d the firm said.  \u201cHopefully, this will not be an issue by the end of the\nyear, but it does depend on the decisions and the markets,\u201d\nDimon said.  JPMorgan also changed how it calculates so-called value at\nrisk, or VAR, a measure of how much the company estimates it\ncould lose on securities on 95 percent of days. The company\nrestated its VAR for the first quarter, previously disclosed at\n$67 million, at $129 million. The bank used a new model for\ncalculating its trading risk in the first quarter that Dimon\nsaid was \u201cinadequate.\u201d It is reverting to the old model.  Hidden Risk  \u201cIt\u2019s a major event that confirms a lot of investors\u2019\nworst fears about bank risk,\u201d said  Frank Partnoy , a former\nderivatives trader who\u2019s now a law and finance professor at the\nUniversity of  San Diego . Concern is \u201cthat at a large,\nsupposedly sophisticated institution, even something called a\n\u2018hedge\u2019 can contain all kinds of hidden risks that the senior\npeople don\u2019t understand.\u201d  Iksil may have amassed a $100 billion position in contracts\non Series 9 of the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade\nIndex, counterparts at  hedge funds  and rival banks said in\nApril. They based their estimates on the trades and price\nmovements they witnessed as well as their understanding of the\nsize and structure of the markets. The positions amounted to\ntens of billions of dollars, under the firm\u2019s own math, a person\nfamiliar with its view said at the time.  Two Dimensions  The trade on the index probably wasn\u2019t a one-way bet, the\nmarket participants said. Iksil may have offset it by buying\nprotection on the same index with contracts that expire about\nseven months from now, the people said. That strategy would pay\nJPMorgan the difference between the long-dated contracts and the\nshort-dated ones, and the trade would gain when the gap narrows.\nThe hedge would end in December unless another trade is made to\nreplace it.  Satyajit Das, the author of \u201cExtreme Money: Masters of the\nUniverse and the Cult of Risk,\u201d compared the publicity around\nJPMorgan\u2019s situation to losses that spiraled at hedge funds like\nLong-Term Capital Management in 1998 and Amaranth Advisors LLC\nin 2006.  \u201cA $2 billion loss suggests a position of considerable\nsize,\u201d Das said. \u201cI think you remember LTCM and a few other\npeople like Amaranth that have had the exact same problem and\nhave learned it\u2019s a bit like hell -- easy to get into, not so\neasy to get out of.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDawn Kopecki in New York at \n dkopecki@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDavid Scheer at \n dscheer@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 31.168415069580078 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
