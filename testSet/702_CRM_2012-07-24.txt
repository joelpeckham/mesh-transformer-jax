 "context": "The following article called 'SAP Took \u2019Strong Market Share\u2019 as Industry Growth Slows' was published on 2012-07-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSAP AG (SAP) , the largest maker of\nbusiness-management software, is beating rivals to software\ncontracts as companies limit their spending amid slowing\neconomies, its co-chief executive officer said.  \u201cWe are now taking very strong market share\u201d with second-\nquarter sales growth exceeding 10 percent in \u201cflat markets,\u201d\nJim Hagemann Snabe said today in a Bloomberg Television\ninterview. \u201cWhile the worries are there about the euro,\ncompanies are still investing, and software is one the areas\nthey invest in to manage this new area of uncertainty.\u201d  Growth in information-technology spending in  Europe , the\n Middle East  and  Africa  was \u201cminimal\u201d because of the debt\ncrisis, with governments also canceling or renegotiating\ncontracts, SAP said in its second-quarter report today. By\ncontrast, the Walldorf, Germany-based company\u2019s revenue from new\nsoftware licenses in the region grew 20 percent excluding\ncurrency swings in the three months ended June 30, boosted by\nprograms for mobile devices, the Hana analytics software and\napplications delivered via the Web.  Growth was \u201csolid\u201d in markets including France, Spain and\n Germany , Snabe said. SAP will rely on increasing revenue rather\nthan on cost cuts to lift profitability after its operating\nmargin declined in the second quarter, he said, adding that SAP\nhad \u201cfront-loaded\u201d investments into the first part of 2012.  SAP  rose  0.5 percent to 49.29 euros at 9:52 a.m. Frankfurt\ntime. It had advanced 20 percent this year through yesterday.  Acquisition Strategy  The company confirmed its full-year forecast. SAP predicts\noperating profit, excluding some items, of 5.05 billion euros\n($6.12 billion) to 5.25 billion euros and adjusted software and\nrelated service revenue growth of 10 percent to 12 percent. Both\nforecasts assume constant currencies and include the acquisition\nof SuccessFactors Inc., completed this year.  Snabe and co-CEO  Bill McDermott  further stepped up SAP\u2019s\nrivalry with  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  by agreeing to buy  Ariba Inc. (ARBA)  in May\nfor $4.3 billion. SAP plans to generate two thirds of its growth\nfrom software that the company develops by itself, with the rest\ncoming from acquisitions, Snabe said. The company pursues a\ntarget of exceeding 20 billion euros of revenue by 2015, up from\n14.2 billion euros last year.  SAP on July 12 reported software-license revenue that\nexceeded analysts\u2019 estimates. The operating margin, based on\nnon-IFRS standards the company uses for internal forecasts,\ndeclined 0.8 percentage points to 30 percent, partly as a\nconsequence of the acquisition of cloud-software operations,\nwhich tend to have lower margins.  Hana Software  Oracle, based in  Redwood City , California, last month\nreported software-license growth of 6.7 percent in the quarter\nending in May.  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , a San Francisco-based\nprovider of online customer-management software, on May 17\nraised its revenue forecast for its fiscal year 2013 after\nsigning more large deals with corporate clients.  SAP said today its Hana software, which lets clients\nprocess large amounts of data quickly in a computer\u2019s memory by\nbypassing slower hard drives, is on track to reach its 2012\nrevenue target after second-quarter sales were 85 million euros.\nMobile revenue was 54 million euros, and cloud products\ngenerated 69 million euros, SAP said.  Net income advanced to 661 million euros, or 55 cents a\nshare, from 587 million euros, or 49 cents, a year earlier.\nAnalysts  predicted  643.7 million euros. Net income, adjusted for\nsome items, increased to 831 million euros from 703 million\neuros. Revenue rose 18 percent to 3.9 billion euros.
