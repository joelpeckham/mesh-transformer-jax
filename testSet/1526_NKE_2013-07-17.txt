 "context": "The following article called 'Nike Just Doesn\u2019t Do It With Lost Sales Year in China' was published on 2013-07-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNot long ago,  Nike Inc. (NKE)  could simply\nopen stores in China and wait for newly minted middle-class\nshoppers to show up.  No longer. Though it has been in China for 30 years, the\nworld\u2019s largest sporting-goods maker is losing customers to\n Adidas AG (ADS) \u2019s more fashionable street wear and  Hennes & Mauritz\nAB (HMB) \u2019s cheap, hip clothing. Making matters worse, Nike is knee-deep in unsold merchandise after a projected post-Olympics sales\nbump didn\u2019t materialize.  Eighteen months ago, Nike was so bullish on China it\npredicted sales there would double to $4 billion in four years.\nNow it says China sales will probably fall for the next two\nquarters, which would make it five in a row.  \u201cYou have to be a smarter retailer now,\u201d said Camilo Lyon, an analyst for Canaccord Financial Inc. in New York who\nrecommends holding the shares. \u201cNow the consumer has become\nmore educated and global and sold to a lot more. Everybody is\nforced to become sharper.\u201d  So far, Nike\u2019s challenges in China haven\u2019t spooked\ninvestors because sales growth in  North America  remains robust.\nIn the past year, revenue in company\u2019s largest market surged 18\npercent.  Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike has advanced 23 percent\nthis year to $62.70, compared with an 18 percent gain for the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. The stock gained 1 percent to\n$63.33 at the close in New York. Analysts expect the shares to\nrise to $66.03 in the next 12 months, according to the average\nof 29 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sluggish Economy  Nike executives have blamed the reversal in China on a\nsluggish economy and changing consumer tastes. The company\ncontinues to believe it has the right strategy to capitalize on\nthe country\u2019s tremendous growth potential, Mary Remuzzi, a\nspokeswoman for Nike, said in an e-mail. Nike declined to make\nan executive available for this story.  Nike entered China in 1982. It became the nation\u2019s best-selling sportswear brand by building basketball courts,\norganizing grassroots competitions and provided funding to\nsporting leagues such as the Chinese Basketball Association and\nthe Chinese Super League soccer.  It sponsored Chinese athletes ranging from national 110-meter hurdler Liu Xiang to former French Open winner  Li Na . The\n2008 Olympics in Beijing helped goose sales, which doubled to $2\nbillion by 2011. While China made up 9.6 percent of Nike\u2019s\nrevenue last fiscal year, the company generated 25 percent of\nits profits there before interest and taxes.  Inventory Pileup  Then the momentum stopped and inventories started piling\nup. The same thing happened to Adidas yet it started discounting\nearlier than Nike to clean out unsold merchandise. Last summer,\nit became clear that Nike inventories were growing faster than\nsales. Revenue from China, excluding the effect of currency\nexchange-rate fluctuations, declined 5 percent to $2.45 billion\nin the fiscal year ended May 31. These results came as  China\u2019s\nretail sales  grew more than 10 percent.  Nike has said the sizing of its apparel hasn\u2019t kept up with\nchanging consumer demands for a tighter fit. Not having a\nprecise fit mattered less when the power of the Nike brand was\nenough to move products, says Faye Landes, an analyst for Cowen\n& Co. in  New York , who recommends buying the shares.  \u201cThe demand was so strong and the business was going so\nwell\u201d that fit didn\u2019t matter, she said in an interview. \u201cNow\nthey\u2019ve realized there\u2019s room for improvement.\u201d  Middle Ground  Adidas, based in Herzogenaurach,  Germany , has sought a\nmiddle ground between sportswear and fast fashion with NEO, a\nyouth-oriented brand it is pushing aggressively in China, which\nhas become NEO\u2019s biggest market.  \u201cAdidas has done the best job of staying ahead of the pack\nwith their understanding of the Chinese consumer,\u201d said Terry\nRhoads, managing director a Zou Marketing, a sports consulting\nfirm in Shanghai. \u201cUnderstanding how they wanted to have\nfashion and sport together.\u201d  Eric Yang, a 20-year-old student at  Shanghai \u2019s Industrial\nand Commercial Foreign language school, was recently sporting a\npair of retro black Adidas Originals sneakers with green and\norange stripes. Yang prefers Adidas to Nike because he says the\nGerman brand provides better value for money.  \u201cThere are Nike and Adidas discount outlets just next to\neach other outside our school,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Adidas outlet is\nalways packed, and the Nike one is never crowded.\u201d  Fast Fashion  Many Chinese youths are gravitating to less pricey fast\nfashion. Sally Wang, an 18-year-old from Zhejiang province, used\nto wear Nike and Adidas when she was younger and hardly ever\ndons sportswear anymore.  \u201cWhen you are younger, you don\u2019t really care and wear\nwhatever your parents buy you,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re\nolder and can chose, Nike and Adidas are rather pricey to me.\u201d  Nike\u2019s marketing also faces hurdles in a changing society.\nThe company continues to use athletes to convey the message that\nanyone can aspire to greatness -- a harder sell these days in a\nnation where Chinese parents, long focused on academic\nachievement, are putting ever more emphasis on hitting the books\nthan the basketball or tennis court. Adidas, by contrast, has\nshifted from a hard-core sports message to one focused on\nfashion and lifestyle, said Jimmy Qin, a vice president at\nsports consulting firm Octagon.  \u201cThe boys complain,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThey say: \u2018My parents\nare making me stay home and now I can\u2019t play basketball.\u2019\u201d  As it struggles to recover lost ground in  China , Nike is\nculling inventory, introducing revamped products and upgrading\nmerchandising. In May, it replaced the top China executive. In\nan encouraging sign, sales are growing at Nike\u2019s largest retail\npartners there, Chief Financial Officer Donald Blair said on a\nconference call with analysts on June 27.  \u201cNevertheless, we still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Blair\nsaid.
