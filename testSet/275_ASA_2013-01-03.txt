 "context": "The following article called 'Statoil, Det Norske Report \u2018Very Good\u2019 Well Results at Sverdrup' was published on 2013-01-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStatoil ASA (STL)  and partner  Det Norske\nOljeselskap ASA (DETNOR)  said an appraisal well confirmed \u201cgood\nreservoir properties\u201d at their Johan Sverdrup oil discovery,\nwhich may be the biggest off  Norway  in almost 40 years.  \u201cThe well results are very good,\u201d Trondheim-based Det\nNorske said today in a statement. The well, in the Kvitsoey\nBasin off the coast of Stavanger, proved a 30-meter (100-foot)\ngross oil column, it said.  The North Sea Johan Sverdrup find, which may hold 1.7\nbillion to 3.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, has helped\nrekindle interest in Norway\u2019s energy industry after the nation\u2019s\noil output fell by half in a decade as deposits aged. The state\nstatistics bureau expects investments to reach a record 208\nbillion kroner ($37 billion) this year.  Statoil, which operates the PL 265 license, will publish\nnew resource estimates for Johan Sverdrup in the fourth quarter,\nwhen the partners will decide on a development plan, spokesman\nOla Anders Skauby said by phone. The Stavanger-based company had\npreviously said updated estimates would be given this quarter.  Today\u2019s result \u201creduces the downside risk for the updated\nresource estimate,\u201d Teodor Sveen Nilsen, an analyst at Swedbank\nFirst Securities, said in a note to clients. \u201cThis well\nindicated higher probability for a midpoint estimate above the\ncurrent 2.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\u201d  A reserves figure at the top end of the range would make\nSverdrup the third-biggest find off Norway since oil was first\nfound in 1969 and the largest since the Statfjord field in 1974.  Reduce Uncertainty  Skauby declined to comment on the impact of the well\nresults on reserve estimates, saying only that \u201cwe see a need\nto continue working on the appraisal program\u201d to reduce the\nuncertainty of the forecast.  Statoil will drill one to three appraisal wells this year\nat the PL 265 area, where it\u2019s \u201csatisfied\u201d with the appraisal\nprogram so far, the company said in a separate statement. It\nowns 40 percent of the permit, Det Norske has 20 percent, Petoro\nAS 30 percent and  Lundin Petroleum AB (LUPE)  10 percent.  Lundin operates the other license at Sverdrup, PL 501, with\na 40 percent stake.
