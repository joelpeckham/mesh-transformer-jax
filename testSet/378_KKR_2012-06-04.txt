 "context": "The following article called 'Brambles to Sell New Shares After Pulling Recall Sale' was published on 2012-06-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrambles Ltd. (BXB) , the world\u2019s largest\nsupplier of warehouse pallets, announced an A$448 million ($432\nmillion) rights offering after scrapping the sale of a document-\nstorage unit that was expected to raise $2 billion.  Bids for Recall didn\u2019t \u201creflect its value or offer\nsufficient certainty,\u201d Sydney-based Brambles said in a\nstatement today. The company, which also reiterated its profit\n forecast , will sell the new shares at an 11 percent discount.  Asia-Pacific acquisitions have slumped 32 percent this\nyear, as concerns about the European financial crisis, the  U.S.\neconomy  and slower growth in  China  damp confidence and cause\nstocks to tumble. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  today fell for a\nfourth straight day, reaching the lowest since October.  \u201cThe market is still in \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 mode,\u201d said Graeme\nBrowning, Sydney-based head of Ernst & Young LLP\u2019s Oceania\nTransaction Advisory Services. \u201cBuyers are looking for\nconfidence that the U.S. is on a better growth path.\u201d  Brambles spokesman James Hall, speaking by phone from\nSydney, had no immediate comment beyond the official statement.  The company will offer 74 million new shares, equivalent to\nabout 5 percent of its issued capital. Investors will be able to\nbuy one share at A$6.05 for every 20 they own. Brambles is\nseeking funds to cut  debt  from last year\u2019s purchase of Ifco\nSystems NV, which operates a pool of reusable plastic\ncontainers.  The stock, which is halted until June 7, closed at A$6.79\non June 1. It has fallen 5.7 percent over the past year,\ncompared to a 13 percent decline in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200\nindex.  Sale Underwriters  The share offering is fully underwritten by  UBS (UBSN)  AG and Bank\nof America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch division.  That support is \u201ca good indication of how desperate\ninvestment banks are\u201d to earn fees from selling shares in the\nabsence of merger activity, said Peter Esho, chief markets\nstrategist at City Index Ltd. in Sydney. The offering \u201cisn\u2019t a\nbad outcome\u201d for Brambles, he said.  The company reiterated that it expects underlying full-year\nearnings before one-time items to be $1.05 billion to $1.08\nbillion, even as it contends with \u201cchallenging trading\nconditions\u201d that aren\u2019t expected to improve immediately. The\ncompany\u2019s  Chep unit  operates a pool of about 300 million pallets\nfor customers including Procter & Gamble Co., Nestle SA and\nGeneral Motors Co.  Earnings Expectations  Brambles will probably spend A$987 million on capital\nprojects this year and A$1.1 billion in each of the next two\nyears, according to the average of six analyst  estimates \ncollected by Bloomberg. Earnings before interest, tax,\ndepreciation and amortization will rise from A$1.6 billion this\nyear to A$2.0 billion in 2014, according to the average of 12\nestimates.  Recall drew bids from private-equity firms including\nCarlyle Group LP and Apollo Global Management LLC, two people\nwith knowledge of the matter said in January. The sale was\nexpected to raise about $2 billion, the people said.  Brambles, which announced plans to sell Recall last August,\nextended the deadline for the sale at least once. It was advised\nby UBS and Merrill Lynch.  \u201cIt is in the best interests of Brambles\u2019 shareholders to\nretain Recall, which is a profitable and growing business,\u201d\nChairman Graham Kraehe said in the statement.  The share sale and retention of Recall will raise Brambles\u2019\nbook value by 19 percent to A$2.8 billion, according to the\ncompany presentation. The raising will help maintain an\ninvestment-grade  credit rating , it said.  Recall Costs  The company will incur costs of $25 million related to the\nsale process in the year ending June 30, it said. That includes\n$6 million already recorded in first-half results. The company\nalso said Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes will retire Oct. 1.  New Hope Corp., an Australian coal miner valued at A$3.4\nbillion, also canceled plans to sell itself after failing to\ndraw bids that met its expectations. Clothing company Pacific\nBrands Ltd. said May 15 that discussions with KKR & Co. were\nunlikely to result in a takeover.  Asia-Pacific companies have made $158 billion of\nacquisitions this year, compared with $270 billion a year\nearlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
