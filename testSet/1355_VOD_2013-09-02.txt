The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.K. stocks  rose the most in eight\nweeks as manufacturing expansion quickened in Britain and China,\nand  Vodafone (VOD)  Group Plc rallied to an 11 1/2-year high.  Vodafone advanced 3.4 percent before Verizon Communications\nInc. agreed to buy out its stake in their wireless venture. Rio\nTinto Group and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  climbed at least 3.9 percent.\nBovis Homes Group Plc led builders higher after data showed\nhouse prices grew faster in August.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 93.26 points, or 1.5 percent, to\n6,506.19 at the close in London, for its biggest increase since\nJuly 4. The benchmark gauge lost 3.1 percent last month on\nconcern the U.S. will take military action against  Syria . The\nbroader FTSE All-Share Index rose 1.5 percent today, while\nIreland\u2019s ISEQ Index advanced 1.4 percent.  \u201cThe Chinese and U.K. figures we had today -- and the form\nof privatized quantitative easing we got with Vodafone -- have\nmeant that things should be relatively positive,\u201d Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $6.8 billion at Seven\nInvestment Management in  London , said by telephone. \u201cThe\ngeopolitical issue has gone at least behind the clouds. It\nhasn\u2019t gone away, but people are focusing on the bigger picture\nin terms of the global economy still slowly healing.\u201d  The volume of shares traded in FTSE 100-listed companies\nwas 11 percent below the average of the last 30 days, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. Stocks slid last week amid\ninvestor concern any military action by the U.S. against Syria\nmay escalate into a larger conflict in the Middle East and push\nup oil prices.  Manufacturing Gauges  A U.K.  factory index  jumped to its highest level in 2 1/2\nyears, data showed today. Markit Economics and the Chartered\nInstitute of Purchasing and Supply said the gauge climbed to\n57.2 in August from a revised 54.8 in July. A reading above 50\nindicates expansion. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had\nforecast a reading of 55 from a previously reported 54.6.  In  China , a  measure of manufacturing  rose to 51 in August\nfrom 50.3 in July. That exceeded the median economist estimate\nin a Bloomberg survey for a reading of 50.6. Separate data\nshowed a purchasing managers\u2019 index for manufacturing published\nby Markit Economics and HSBC Holdings Plc increased to 50.1 last\nmonth from 47.7 in July.  Vodafone gained 3.4 percent to 213.2 pence, its highest\nprice since December 2001. In a deal announced after the London\nmarket closed, Verizon agreed to purchase Vodafone\u2019s 45 percent\nstake in Verizon Wireless. The $130 billion transaction gives\nVerizon full control of the most profitable U.S. mobile-phone\ncarrier. The deal has been approved by both companies\u2019 boards\nand is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014,\naccording to a statement today.  Commodity Producers  A gauge of U.K. mining companies jumped 2.8 percent as the\nprice of copper and silver climbed. Rio Tinto jumped 4.2 percent\nto 3,035 pence.

Morgan Stanley raised its\n recommendation  for the largest provider of maritime satellite\nservices to overweight, a rating similar to buy, from equal\nweight. Inmarsat\u2019s spectrum assets currently stuck with the\nbankrupt LightSquared Inc. are undervalued, the brokerage said.\nA potential bid for the U.S. company by Dish Network Corp. may\nhelp LightSquared to resume payments to Inmarsat by April 2014,\nMorgan Stanley said.  WPP Plc jumped 3.5 percent to 1,237 pence, the highest\nprice since March 2000. Deutsche Bank raised its rating of the\nworld\u2019s largest advertising company to a buy from hold. WPP is\nmost likely to benefit in a changing advertising landscape that\nfaces increased competition from technology and opportunities\nfrom a transition to the digital medium, according to analysts\nPatrick Kirby and Matt Chesler.  Fresnillo Plc retreated 2.2 percent to 1,275 pence for the\nbiggest decline in the FTSE 100. The silver-and-gold producer\nwas cut to neutral from buy by UBS AG analyst Daniel Major, who\nsaid the valuation looks less attractive after shares rallied 27\npercent in August.
