 "context": "The following article called 'Sharapova Rises in Tennis Rankings as Shoe Design Helps Nike Unit\u2019s Sales' was published on 2012-01-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMaria Sharapova  finished last season\ninside the top 5 in women\u2019s tennis for the first time since\n2007. At Nike Inc.\u2019s  Cole Haan  unit, she\u2019s No. 1.  The fourth-seeded Russian, who beat  Argentina \u2019s Gisela Dulko today in her opening match at the Australian Open,\nsuffered a serious shoulder injury in 2008 after winning in\n Melbourne , the third of her major titles. The time off gave the\n24-year-old a chance to pursue another interest: fashion.  The $148 flat ballet shoe she designed is one of the best\nsellers for the Nike wholly-owned subsidiary. She was forced\ninto a nine-month break from the game in mid-2008 because of\nshoulder surgery, giving her a chance to focus on something\nother than tennis, Sharapova said. Her first Cole Haan\ncollection was introduced in the spring of 2009.  \u201cIt was really an experiment for me,\u201d said Sharapova, who\ngets a percentage of sales from both her Cole Haan line and a\ncollection of  Nike (NKE)  tennis dresses, which she also designs. \u201cI\ncertainly did not think I would be making any money from this\nbecause I had zero experience.\u201d  Sharapova won her first major at  Wimbledon  age 17 in 2004.\nGrand slam titles followed at the 2006  U.S. Open  and the 2008\nAustralian Open, making her the highest-paid female athlete in\nthe world. The Russian, who moved to the U.S. at age seven,\nearns $25 million a year from prize money and endorsements with\ncompanies including Nike and Swiss luxury watch brand Tag Heuer,\naccording to Forbes. In tennis, only 16-time major winner  Roger Federer  and second-ranked  Rafael Nadal  earn more.  No. 126   Having dropped to No. 126 three years ago following\nsurgery, Sharapova last year climbed back up the rankings thanks\nto a semifinals spot at  Roland Garros  and a runner-up place at\nWimbledon. She also won in Rome and Cincinnati.  Sharapova gives Nike and Cole Haan, a clothing, shoes,\nhandbag and accessory brand based in Yarmouth,  Maine , access to\na global audience, Nigel Currie, director of London-based sports\nmarketing agency brandRapport said in an interview.  \u201cThere are very few sports stars, in particular in women\u2019s\nsports, that are instantly recognizable around the world, and\nSharapova is one of them,\u201d Currie said.  Cole Haan generates less than 3 percent of total sales at\nNike, the world\u2019s largest sporting-goods company. The company\ndeclined to release sales figures for Sharapova\u2019s shoe line.  Getting Sharapova on board gave the brand the chance to\nconnect with a \u201cyounger\u201d audience, said Ivan Wicksteed, Cole\nHaan\u2019s chief marketing officer.  Chasing Slam Success  Sharapova comes into 2012 with more confidence after\ngetting further into majors last season, which allowed her to\nfinish inside the top 10 for the first time since 2008. She was\nNo. 1 in May 2008.  \u201cIt was really important to have that type of year, with\nbetter results,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cAs with any sport, you gain\nconfidence on where your game is and belief.\u201d  An ankle injury sustained in  Tokyo  in September derailed a\nshot at taking over the No. 1 ranking from  Denmark \u2019s  Caroline Wozniacki  at the end of last year.  To finish the season that way was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d said\nSharapova, who pulled out of a lead-up event in Brisbane two\nweeks ago because of her left ankle. \u201cInjuries are always the\ntoughest part.\u201d  Entering the Australian Open having last played on the WTA\nTour in October is going to be \u201ca bit different,\u201d said the\nSiberian-born right-hander, who has been training in Melbourne\nfor the past two weeks.  She had little trouble against the 68th-ranked Dulko today,\nwinning 6-0, 6-1 in 58 minutes.  Coming up with a new design that will rival the success of\nthe ballet shoe may not be as easy.  \u201cWhen you start with -- let\u2019s call it a \u2018luck shoe\u2019 --\nit\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cThe great thing is that\nnow you have customers that are coming back to get another pair\nin a different color when the one that they bought wears out.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDanielle Rossingh in London at \n drossingh@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChristopher Elser at \n celser@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Nike, Inc. was 20.132795333862305 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Nike, Inc. was ",
