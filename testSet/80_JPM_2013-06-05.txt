 "context": "The following article called 'Dollar Holds Above 100 Yen on Fed Speculation Before Jobs Report' was published on 2013-06-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe dollar held above 100 yen for a\nsecond day, after rallying from the lowest in almost a month,\nbefore U.S. employment data that may add to the case for the\nFederal Reserve to slow stimulus.  Kansas City Fed President Esther George yesterday urged a\nreduction in the central bank\u2019s bond-buying program, known as\nquantitative easing, as growth quickens. San Francisco Fed\nPresident John Williams said a \u201cmodest adjustment downward\u201d in\npurchases is possible \u201cas early as this summer.\u201d  Australia \u2019s\ndollar fell after the nation\u2019s economy grew at the slowest pace\nin almost two years.  \u201cThe dollar weakness only lasted for a day,\u201d said Kazuo Shirai, a trader at Union Bank NA in Los Angeles. \u201cThe market\nwill be swayed by comments by Fed speakers about when they may\nend the QE program ahead of U.S. jobs data.\u201d  The dollar gained 0.2 percent to 100.18 yen at 11:04 a.m.\nin Tokyo from yesterday, when it advanced 0.5 percent. It slid\nto 98.87 on June 3, the lowest since May 9. The euro fell 0.1\npercent to $1.3072. The shared currency was little changed at\n130.95 yen from 130.84.  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses\nto track the greenback against currencies of six U.S. trading\npartners, rose 0.1 percent to 82.86.  The ADP Research Institute will probably say today the pace\nof hiring in the U.S. quickened by 46,000 jobs to 165,000 in May\nfrom the previous month, according to the median estimate of\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  U.S. Economy  The Labor Department reported last month that nonfarm\npayrolls swelled by 165,000 jobs in April, more than forecast,\nand the unemployment  rate  unexpectedly fell to 7.5 percent. It\nwill probably say June 7 that employers added 167,000 workers in\nMay, economists forecast.  Figures from the Commerce Department yesterday showed the\nU.S. trade deficit widened in April from a more than three-year\nlow, reflecting a rebound in imports of consumer goods and\nbusiness equipment.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage\nbonds each month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs\nunder its quantitative-easing stimulus strategy, which tends to\ndebase the dollar.  \u201cIn light of improving economic conditions, I support\nslowing the pace of asset purchases as an appropriate next step\nfor monetary policy,\u201d Kansas City Fed President George said in\nthe text of her speech. \u201cWaiting too long to acknowledge the\neconomy\u2019s progress and prepare markets for more-normal policy\nsettings carries no less risk than tightening too soon,\u201d she\nsaid.  \u2018Dial Back\u2019  Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher told reporters in\nToronto the Fed should begin to \u201cdial back\u201d rate of bond\nbuying.  The dollar has gained 4.5 percent this year, the best\nperformance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by\nBloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has climbed 3.5\npercent, while the yen has declined 11 percent, the biggest\nloser.  The yen weakened against most of its major peers before\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe outlines his growth strategy,\nthe \u201cthird arrow\u201d of an economic revival plan that seeks to\nbuild on fiscal and monetary stimulus. The currency fell to the\nweakest since October 2008 last month, after the Bank of Japan\nannounced in April it will buy more than 7 trillion yen ($70\nbillion) of bonds every month.  \u201cShould we see more details of Abe\u2019s growth strategy come\nout, that may spur buying of domestic stocks and put the yen\nunder selling pressure,\u201d said  Junya Tanase , the chief currency\nstrategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo.  The  Topix share index  was little changed from yesterday,\nwhen it jumped 2.6 percent.  Must Deliver  \u201cThe speculative community is still very, very long\ndollar-yen, so any signs of disappointment may trigger a knee-jerk move lower on dollar-yen,\u201d  Thomas Harr , the head of Asia\nlocal markets strategy at Standard Chartered Plc in  Singapore ,\nsaid in a Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cWe still think over\nthe coming months,  there will be a further leg up in dollar-yen, but he has to deliver today and calm market to put upward\npressure again on dollar-yen.\u201d A long is a bet prices will\nrise.  Demand for the euro was limited before data forecast to\nconfirm a sixth straight quarter of contraction in the region\u2019s\neconomy.  Preliminary figures  will probably show that gross\ndomestic product in the 17-nation euro zone shrank 0.2 percent\nin the three-months ended March 31, after a 0.6 percent decline\nin the fourth quarter, economists predicted before the release\ntoday.  Australia\u2019s Growth  In Australia,  GDP (AUNAGDPC)  grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in\nthe first quarter, the slowest pace since the three months ended\nJune 30, 2011, a statistics bureau report released in Sydney\nshowed. The result was less than the 2.7 percent increase\nexpected by economists in a Bloomberg survey and revised 3.2\npercent growth in the fourth quarter.  Demand for New Zealand\u2019s kiwi dollar was limited after milk\nprices fell to a three-month low. Whole milk powder auction\nprices tumbled amid expectations of rising production in the\nsecond half of the year.  Powder for August delivery slumped 15 percent, according to\na trade-weighted index on the Auckland-based Fonterra\nCooperative Group Ltd.\u2019s GlobalDairyTrade website. The near-term\ncontract for New Zealand product fell to $5,250 a metric ton,\nthe lowest since March 5.  The Aussie dropped 0.3 percent to 96.17 U.S. cents from\nyesterday, when it sank 1.2 percent. New Zealand\u2019s dollar was\nlittle changed at 80.24 U.S. cents from yesterday, when it\nweakened 0.9 percent.
