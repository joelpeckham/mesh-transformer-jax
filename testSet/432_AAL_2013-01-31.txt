 "context": "The following article called 'Eskom Asks BHP, Anglo to Cap Coal Costs to Limit Tariff Rise' was published on 2013-01-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which\nsupplies about 95 percent of South Africa\u2019s power, is working on\nan agreement to cap coal costs as the energy regulator examines\nthe utility\u2019s request for above-inflation tariff increases.  \u201cI had a very good meeting with our four large suppliers\nwho make up 70 percent of coal requirements\u201d needed for\nelectricity generation, Chief Executive Officer  Brian Dames  said\nby phone yesterday. \u201cThey have committed to work with us on\nthis and we\u2019re hoping that this week we can take that further.\u201d  The utility, which relies on coal for more than 80 percent\nof generation, is seeking a 16 percent advance in average\nelectricity prices each year until 2018 to avoid a repeat of\nenergy shortages that halted mines in 2008. Inflation was 5.7\npercent in December. The National Energy Regulator of South\nAfrica tomorrow concludes public hearings on the application and\nwill make a decision by the end of February.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and\n Anglo American Plc (AAL)  are Eskom\u2019s biggest suppliers of the fuel.  The government considers coal a strategic mineral and\nregulations will be passed to ensure  South Africa  has security\nof supply, Mineral Resources Minister Susan Shabangu said at a\nconference yesterday. The government doesn\u2019t want companies to\nlose export contracts and hasn\u2019t decided whether to impose\nexport levies on coal, she said.  Suppliers\u2019 Commitment  An annual 16 percent increase would raise prices to 128\ncents per kilowatt hour by 2017 from 61 cents now.  \u201cA lot of work has to go in especially to get their\ncommitment and achieve 10 percent and then if we can do that\nthen surely we can do better than that,\u201d Dames said of a\npossible agreement with coal suppliers.  Eskom\u2019s proposed tariff increases may hit state hospitals\nand clinics hardest, Public Servants Association General Manager\nDanny Adonis said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  \u201cHealth departments are already experiencing problems with\npaying their service providers,\u201d Adonis said.  The higher power prices may have a negative effect on the\nviability of many businesses, the South African Local Government\nAssociation said in an e-mailed statement today.  The 16 percent tariff increase includes 3 percentage points\nto support the cost of introducing independent renewable energy\nproducers through a build program of 3,725 megawatts, Dames\nsaid.  Coal Plants  The government prevented Eskom from expanding from 2004 to\n2008 as it sought to attract investments in the power industry.\nThe utility is now building what will be the world\u2019s third-and\nfourth-biggest coal-fired power plants, which will produce about\n4,800 megawatts each, to halt shortages.  Work at Medupi in Limpopo province, the smaller of the two\ncoal-fired stations under construction, has been suspended for\ntwo weeks after Eskom sent workers home after protests, the\ncompany said Jan. 29. Construction at Medupi, the first unit of\nwhich is due to start producing electricity at the end of the\nyear, stopped on Jan. 16.  \u201cI\u2019m very concerned and it\u2019s really having a material\nimpact,\u201d Dames said during a break from the tariff hearing held\nin Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
