 "context": "The following article called 'Australian Central Bank Set to Keep Its Key Rate at 4.75% as Economy Slows' was published on 2010-12-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Reserve Bank of Australia is\nlikely to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged tomorrow as\nprevious increases slow the economy and reduce the risk of\nfaster inflation.  Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board will leave the\novernight cash rate target at 4.75 percent in Sydney tomorrow,\naccording to all 25 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News.\nStevens told lawmakers in testimony 10 days ago that \u201cthere\u2019s\nunlikely to be anything from us imminently\u201d on borrowing costs.  Australia\u2019s economy probably won\u2019t reach the central bank\u2019s\nforecast 3.5 percent growth in 2010 after it expanded last\nquarter at the slowest pace in almost two years, according to\nCitigroup Inc. Stevens\u2019 aim to contain prices was aided by some\nof the nation\u2019s largest banks boosting mortgage rates by almost\ndouble the RBA\u2019s quarter-percentage-point increase on Nov. 2.  \u201cWith rates up in November, inflation under control and\nthe economy losing momentum in the past quarter, clearly now is\nnot the time to be lifting rates further,\u201d said  Craig James , a\nsenior economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.\ndebt crisis there.\u201d  Australia\u2019s currency declined to 99.01 U.S. cents as of\n11:33 a.m. in Sydney from 99.31 cents in New York last week. It\nreached 99.39 cents on Dec. 3, the most since Nov. 22.  Rate Bets  Traders bet there is a 90 percent chance Stevens will leave\nborrowing costs unchanged through the first quarter of next year,\naccording to Bloomberg calculations based on interbank futures\non the Sydney Futures Exchange.  The currency declined 2.5 percent against the U.S. dollar\nover the past month as reports indicated a slowing economy.  Retail sales declined in October by the most since July\n2009, according to data released last week, and a private report\nshowed consumer confidence fell in November to a five-month low.\nHousehold spending accounts for about half of the nation\u2019s gross\ndomestic product.  Business profits also dropped in the three months through\nSeptember, the first quarterly decline in more than a year.\nLending to businesses slid 0.8 percent in October from September,\naccording to the central bank.  The economy grew 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the\nprevious period, the worst performance since a contraction at\nthe end of 2008, a government report showed on Dec. 1.  Earlier Move  Stevens, in testimony to the  House of Representatives\nCommittee on Economics  on Nov. 26, said while last month\u2019s\ndecision to raise rates was finely balanced, it was typically\nbetter to move earlier than later.  \u201cWe have to balance that risk, obviously, against the risk\nof getting behind the game and historically, for many central\nbanks including us, that has tended to be the mistake that we\nmade,\u201d the governor told lawmakers.  Australia\u2019s currency reached parity with the U.S. dollar in\nOctober as traders bet the central bank would boost borrowing\ncosts and the Federal Reserve prepared to pump additional\nstimulus into the world\u2019s largest economy. The RBA is seeking to\ncontain an expected acceleration in inflation as Australia\nexperiences a resource investment boom that is prompting\ncompanies to increase hiring to meet demand from China.  Inflation Gauge  A gauge of Australia\u2019s inflation accelerated in November\nand surpassed the top of the central bank\u2019s target range for a\nthird straight month.  Consumer prices increased 3.9 percent last month from a\nyear earlier, after advancing 3.8 percent in October, according\nto an index compiled by TD Securities Ltd. and the Melbourne\nInstitute released in Sydney today. Prices increased 0.4 percent\nfrom a month earlier, when they gained 0.3 percent.  Australian job advertisements rose in November by the most\nin nine months, according to an Australia & New Zealand Banking\nGroup Ltd. report today. Jobs advertised in newspapers and on\nthe Internet advanced 2.9 percent from October, when they\nincreased a revised 0.7 percent, the release showed.  Australian employers probably added 20,000 workers in\nNovember, the ninth straight month of gains, according to a\nseparate Bloomberg survey ahead of a Dec. 9 report. Employers\nhave added 301,600 jobs from January to October and the monthly\naverage gain this year is the biggest in at least three decades.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. , Australia\u2019s third-biggest\nproducer of iron ore, last month approved an $8.4 billion\nexpansion in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara region to almost triple\noutput as demand from steelmakers gains.  China Steel Mills  It joins  Rio Tinto Group , Vale SA and  BHP Billiton Ltd.  in\nannouncing expansions as prices increase. Producers are seeking\nto meet demand from steel mills in China, where consumption of\nthe alloy is forecast by Rio Tinto to double by 2020 from 2008\nlevels.  \u201cOn all the indications available, we are living through\nan event that occurs maybe once or twice in a century,\u201d Stevens\nsaid in an address to a Committee for Economic Development of\nAustralia event in Melbourne a week ago. \u201cWe obviously have to\nbe wary of overheating.\u201d  The RBA\u2019s quarter-point increase last month was followed by\nlarger rises in the standard variable home-loan rates of  Westpac\nBanking Corp.,   National Australia Bank Ltd. ,  Australia & New\nZealand Banking Group Ltd.  and Commonwealth Bank.  That prompted a political backlash and government moves to\nincrease competition in the banking industry. Local politicians\nare sensitive to increases in borrowing costs as more than 90\npercent of Australian borrowers have variable-rate home loans.  The RBA is unlikely to raise rates again before the second\nquarter of 2011 as the economy is \u201cyet to see the effect of the\nrecent tightening on activity and mortgage rates went up by 40\nbasis points,\u201d said  Paul Bloxham , chief economist for Australia\nand New Zealand at HSBC Holdings Plc in Sydney and a former RBA\nofficial, who previously forecast a move in the first quarter.  \u201cThis month\u2019s decision is almost a fait accompli,\u201d he\nsaid. The RBA\u2019s next monetary policy meeting is on Feb. 1.
