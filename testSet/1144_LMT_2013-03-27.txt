 "context": "The following article called 'Lockheed\u2019s Troubled F-35 Unscathed in Pentagon\u2019s Budget' was published on 2013-03-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Pentagon wants to spend about\n$8.4 billion in the next fiscal year to continue developing and\npurchasing  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) \u2019s F-35, the fighter that is\nseven years behind schedule and 70 percent over initial cost\nestimates.  The funding includes $6.36 billion to build all 29 of the\nF-35s previously planned for 2014, including 19 of the version\ndesigned for the Air Force, six for the Marine Corps and four\nfor the Navy, according to a budget document obtained today by\n Bloomberg News . The remaining funds would be for continued\ndevelopment and spare parts.  The proposal for the Joint Strike Fighter will be part of a\n$526.6 billion  defense budget  that President  Barack Obama  will\npropose next month for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1,\naccording to government officials familiar with the budget plan\nwho asked not to be identified discussing it in advance.  The budget request, which doesn\u2019t include money for war-\nrelated expenses such as the conflict in  Afghanistan  and troops\nin the Middle East, reflects the Pentagon\u2019s commitment to the\nF-35, its most expensive weapons program, despite its soaring\ncost and pressures to cut Pentagon spending. Buying 29 F-35s\nnext year, the same number Congress approved for the current\nyear, would mean stability after reductions from planned\npurchases for three consecutive years.  Obama\u2019s budget request will be his opening bid in the\nannual spending negotiations with Congress, which have been\ndelayed and complicated this year by the budget cuts called\nsequestration. The Pentagon plan, which is always reshaped by\ncongressional committees, will call for $99.3 billion for\nprocurement and $67.5 billion for research and development,\naccording to the officials.  Automatic Cuts  The proposed  defense spending  for fiscal 2014 doesn\u2019t\ninclude automatic cuts of as much as $50 billion that will be\nimposed unless Obama and Congress rescind or amend the deficit-\nreduction requirement. That will let the administration make the\npolitical case that programs such as the F-35, with the jobs it\ncreates for suppliers in 45 states, will emerge unscathed if\nRepublicans accept Obama\u2019s plan to replace sequestration with a\ncombination of spending cuts and revenue increases.  The estimated cost for a fleet of 2,443 F-35 fighters has\nclimbed to $395.7 billion, a 70 percent increase since 2001.\nPentagon officials have prodded Bethesda, Maryland-based\nLockheed, the world\u2019s largest defense contractor, and its\nsubcontractors to improve performance and reduce costs.  The F-35 is being developed and built at the same time, an\napproach that was called \u201cacquisition malpractice\u201d last year\nby Frank Kendall, who is now the Pentagon\u2019s undersecretary for\nacquisition.  Calming Anxieties  Over the past three years, the Pentagon deferred planned\npurchases of 425 F-35s until after 2017.  The F-35 funding to be proposed for fiscal 2014 \u201cwill help\ncalm any anxieties amongst the partner nations\u201d buying the\njets, Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace with\nthe London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies,\nsaid in an interview.  Among the partners are the U.K.,  Italy ,  Australia ,  Canada ,\nthe Netherlands,  Norway ,  Denmark ,  Turkey , Singapore, Japan and\n Israel .  \u201cIf you see cuts in the U.S. numbers, then partner nations\nthink, \u2018What does this mean for me?\u2019\u201d he said of the prospect\nthat the price per plane would increase.  Under sequestration, the Pentagon must cut as much as $46\nbillion across 2,500 programs, projects and accounts over the\nremaining seven months of the fiscal year.  Air Force  officials have projected that as many as five of\n19 F-35s it requested for this year -- part of the 29 for three\nservices -- could be cut under sequestration.  \u2018Big Decision\u2019  \u201cThe big decision for me on F-35 will be the decision on\nthe FY 2015 budget: Do we ramp up or not?\u201d Kendall told\nreporters March 12 at a defense conference in Washington.  The Defense Department plans increases to 44 planes in\nfiscal 2015 and 66 in fiscal 2016, according to figures included\nlast year in its long-range budget plan. A new plan for fiscal\n2014 to 2018 will be released next month.  \u201cOverall, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is moving\nin the right direction after a long, expensive and arduous\nlearning period,\u201d the U.S. Government Accountability Office\nsaid in a report this month.  \u201cGoing forward, ensuring affordability -- the ability to\nacquire the aircraft in quantity\u201d that keeps the per-plane\nprice down -- \u201cis of paramount concern,\u201d the GAO said.
