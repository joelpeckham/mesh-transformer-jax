The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEssar Group and  Vodafone Group Plc \nwill probably appoint  UBS AG  as a third investment bank to help\nreach an independent valuation of their Indian joint venture,\nsaid four people with knowledge of the plan.  UBS\u2019s task would be to help the companies reach a\ncompromise on the valuation of Vodafone Essar Ltd., said the\npeople, who declined to be named before an official\nannouncement. Vodafone Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao\nsaid this month that Vodafone appointed  Goldman Sachs Group Inc .\nand Essar appointed  Standard Chartered Plc . The investment banks\nmay submit a report in March, said two of the people.  Essar has an option to sell its entire 33 percent stake for\n$5 billion to Vodafone or it can sell a smaller stake at an\nindependently appraised fair market value. Essar, founded by\nbillionaires Shashi and Ravi Ruia, is seeking a higher valuation\nof its stake in  Vodafone Essar . The company may sell about 22\npercent in the venture before the window to divest the holding\ncloses in May, said two of the people.  Essar may hold the remaining 11 percent stake in a listed\nIndian company as part of an earlier agreement between both\ncompanies, the people said. Spokespeople for Vodafone and Essar\ndeclined to comment.  Last year, bankers had valued the company at between $13\nbillion and $18 billion when Essar had considered an initial\npublic offering for the Indian venture, said one of the people.\nThat would have valued Essar\u2019s stake at $4.3 billion to $6\nbillion.  Intense Competition  The valuation included Vodafone Essar\u2019s 42 percent stake in\nIndus Towers, the world\u2019s largest phone tower company, according\nto Essar\u2019s website. Vodafone also in July agreed to pay an extra\n34 billion rupees should Essar sell some of its shares to\naccount for the cost of high-speed Internet licenses.  Vodafone, based in Newbury,  England , bought a 67 percent\nstake in Hutchison Essar for $10.7 billion in 2007. Vodafone\u2019s\noutlook for India soured a year after its entry, when six new\nnational licenses were awarded.  Vodafone in May took a $3.3 billion charge for the Indian\nunit, citing \u201cintense price competition.\u201d Vodafone competes\nagainst more than a dozen operators in the world\u2019s second-\nlargest market for mobile-phone customers.  Since then, prospects have improved. India was one of the\n\u201cjewels\u201d in the three months through December, Vodafone CEO\nColao said this month. Vodafone\u2019s service revenue from India\nincreased by 17 percent in the fiscal third quarter.
