 "context": "The following article called 'Florida Measure May Send More Inmates to Private Prisons Than in Any State' was published on 2012-02-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFlorida , which oversees the third-\nlargest U.S. prison population, would have more inmates in\nprivate lockups than any other state under a plan that a divided\nSenate will consider today.  The bill, which would put up for bids the operation of 27\nprisons and work camps, is intended to save $16.5 million a year\nby increasing the number of inmates in private prisons to more\nthan 25,000, about a quarter of those behind bars. Florida\nspends $268 million running the facilities, according to a\nSenate  analysis .  While the proposal is supported by Governor  Rick Scott ,\nwhose fellow Republicans control 28 of the chamber\u2019s 40 votes,\nits passage is not certain.  \u201cWe\u2019re struggling with all sorts of issues,\u201d Senate\nBudget Committee Chairman J.D. Alexander, a Republican who\nsupports the change, told fellow lawmakers yesterday. \u201cHere we\nhave an opportunity, I think a responsibility, to look very hard\nat this issue and see if there is a way we can save money.\u201d  As Florida and 28 other states close shortfalls totaling\n$44 billion this year, according to the  Center on Budget and\nPolicy Priorities , more look to sell assets or outsource\ntraditional responsibilities. Since 2005, the number of state\nprisoners in private lockups has increased 16.7 percent, while\nthe total prison population increased 4.1 percent in the same\nperiod, according to U.S.  Justice Department  data.  Taking the Lead  Florida\u2019s 104,306 prisoners trail only  California \u2019s 165,062\nand  Texas \u2019s 173,649, according to the Justice Department.  Texas has about 15,000 prisoners in privately run prisons,\naccording to the Texas Criminal Justice Department. That\u2019s more\nthan any other state, according to the U.S. Justice Department.  The Florida proposal would move 14,500 inmates into private\nfacilities. Boca Raton-based  Geo Group Inc. (GEO) , which already runs\ntwo Florida lockups, has expressed interest.  \u201cThis is the largest single contract procurement in the\nhistory of our industry,\u201d Geo Chief Executive Officer George Zoley said, according to a transcript of an Aug. 3 conference\ncall with investors. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken what we believe are important\nsteps to put our company in a competitive position to pursue\nthis unprecedented opportunity.\u201d  Nashville, Tennessee-based  Corrections Corp. of America\nInc.  already runs four of Florida\u2019s prisons and its lobbyists\nhave attended Senate sessions on the bill.  \u201cShould the state expand public-private partnership in\ncorrections, we would welcome the opportunity to further meet\nFlorida\u2019s needs,\u201d Steve Owen, a CCA spokesman, said by e-mail.  CCA and Geo are the two largest private-prison contractors\nin the U.S.  Protecting Guards  Under the plan, the state would seek bids for a contract as\nlong as five years to operate and maintain the prison facilities\nand require at least a 7 percent savings in the first year.  Opponents, including Republican Senators Mike Fasano and\nJack Latvala, criticized the deal\u2019s size, saying it would\njeopardize jobs for 3,800 prison workers. The state eliminated\nthe positions of 4,500 public workers in its 2011 budget and\nScott has suggested cutting another 4,500 this year, including\n1,700 prison employees.  \u201cThe public has more trust in state workers running our\nprisons safely then they do the public sector,\u201d Republican\nSenator Dennis Jones said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had a raise in six\nyears and this is one more jab in the eye.\u201d  Out They Go  Scott in August replaced his first prison chief, Edwin\nBoss, who opposed the private-prison plan. Senate President Mike Haridopolos, who supports the bill, said he removed Fasano as\nchairman of the Budget Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil\nJustice Appropriations on Feb. 1 because of Fasano\u2019s opposition\nto the deal.  Fasano said the measure favors some private vendors. He and\nother opponents pointed to a report from the state Corrections\nDepartment, under Buss, that showed it would cost the state $25\nmillion to pay out vacation, sick leave and other benefits to\n3,800 prison workers if they lost their jobs.  Supporters, meanwhile, said the estimated $16.5 million\nsavings was low. Alexander said the savings might be as much as\n$30 million.  \u201cThat buys a lot of teachers for the classroom,\u201d said\nSenator Don Gaetz.  Scott, who campaigned on cutting $1 billion out of the $2.4\nbillion Florida Corrections Department budget, summoned\nopponents to his office earlier this month in a bid to change\ntheir minds. Two Republican senators, Charlie Dean and Steve Oelrich, both former sheriffs, said they were unpersuaded.  \u201cThere\u2019s some things we ought to do and taking custody and\ncontrol of the people we imprison is one of them,\u201d Oelrich told\nthe Tampa Bay Times.  Scott told reporters Jan. 31 he thought private companies\nmay save the state more than 7 percent.  \u201cPeople expect us to spend their money well,\u201d Scott said.\n\u201cIf we do prison privatization, it\u2019s going to save the state\nmoney and we\u2019ll do it the right way.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMichael C.
