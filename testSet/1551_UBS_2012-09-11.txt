 "context": "The following article called 'Deutsche Bank to Review Pay, Bonuses, Boost Profitability' was published on 2012-09-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Europe \u2019s biggest\nbank by assets, will cut costs by 4.5 billion euros ($5.8\nbillion) and review pay practices to boost profitability amid\nhigher  capital requirements  and Europe\u2019s debt crisis.  Deutsche Bank will seek to increase its after-tax return on\nequity to at least 12 percent by 2015, the Frankfurt-based\nlender said in a statement today, from 8.2 percent in 2011. The\ncompany will incur 4 billion euros of costs to achieve its\nannual savings target by 2015 and plans to eliminate more jobs.  \u201cThe medium-term economic recovery and regulatory outlook\nis challenging, hence we need to significantly improve our\noperating performance and efficiency,\u201d co-Chief Executive\nOfficers Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen said in the statement.\n\u201cIt is not enough to adapt our strategy to customers\u2019 changing\ndemands; we also have to secure our competitiveness.\u201d  The bank said it will extend the period for deferred bonus\npayouts to senior management and appoint an external committee\nto review compensation. Jain, 49, and Fitschen, 64, are\noutlining their strategy in Frankfurt today after taking over\nfrom  Josef Ackermann , 64, in May. Investment banks are fighting\nto buoy profits as record-low  interest rates  and a drop in\ntrading and deal-making curb revenue.  Deutsche Bank  rose  1.7 percent 32.38 euros by 1:28 p.m. in\nFrankfurt trading, bringing the gain this year to 9.9 percent.  Lower Profitability  Deutsche Bank\u2019s after-tax return on average active equity,\na figure it uses to measure profitability, fell to 7.4 percent\nin the first half from 8.2 percent in 2011. The measure reached\n20.4 percent in 2006, before the financial crisis led regulators\nto demand that banks set aside more capital.  To help reverse the slide in profitability, Deutsche Bank\nannounced in July that it will eliminate as many as 1,900 jobs.\nThe cuts, mostly outside  Germany , will include 1,500 at the\ninvestment bank and support areas. Fitschen said today there\nwill be more job reduction beyond those announced, though the\nnumber and location have not been decided.  Deutsche Bank follows rivals in recalibrating profit goals.\n Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  reduced its after-tax ROE goal to \u201cmore\nthan 15 percent\u201d from a previous target of more than 18 percent\nin February last year.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive Officer\n Antony Jenkins  said yesterday that the London-based bank is\nseeking returns above its 11 percent to 11.5 percent cost of\nequity.  UBS AG (UBSN)  said in November that it\u2019s targeting an after-tax\nROE of 12 percent to 17 percent starting in 2013.  Capital Laggard  Deutsche Bank plans to reduce regional back-office\nactivities and centralize procurement, as well as cut down on\ninvestment in information technology platforms. Those steps will\naccount for almost 40 percent, or 1.7 billion euros, of the\nplanned savings, according to the statement. The banks will also\nsell about 40 properties.  Global regulators are forcing banks to increase capital\nbuffers to prevent a repeat of the taxpayer-funded bailouts that\nfollowed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Deutsche\nBank\u2019s capital levels trail those of Barclays of  London  and\nZurich-based Credit Suisse and UBS, data compiled by Bloomberg\nIndustries show.  Tougher rules from the  Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision , known as Basel III, that call for lenders to hold\nmore reserves will begin taking effect at the start of 2013 and\nbe fully implemented by 2019. Banks worldwide will be required\nto hold common equity of at least 7 percent of risk-weighted\nassets by 2019, and firms deemed systemically important, such as\nDeutsche Bank, will need more.  \u2018Tremendous Pressure\u2019  The German bank would be the least capitalized of seven\nEuropean wholesale banks at the end of this year if 2019 rules\nwere applied, Credit Suisse said in a note yesterday, citing\ncompany disclosures and estimates by the brokerage.  \u201cWe are under tremendous pressure to reduce risk-weighted\nassets,\u201d Jain said.  Deutsche Bank plans to boost its core tier 1 capital level\nunder full Basel III requirements to at least 8 percent by the\nend of the first quarter of 2013, and more than 10 percent by\nMarch 31, 2015, the company said today.  The bank plans to cut Basel III risk-weighted assets by 135\nbillion euros to boost  capital ratios , including about 100\nbillion euros from the investment bank. The securities unit will\naim for Basel III risk-weighted assets of less than 200 billion\neuros by 2015.  The de-risking process will be \u201cvery rapid,\u201d Jain told\nreporters at the press conference. The bank plans to achieve 45\nbillion euros in reductions by the end of the first quarter and\nhas already cut 14 billion euros in the first two months of the\ncurrent quarter, incurring some trading losses, he said.  Even so, Jain said investment-banking revenues were solid\nin July and August.  Deutsche Bank also said it merged asset and wealth\nmanagement with its exchange-traded-funds business to build an\n\u201cefficient platform for future growth by eliminating as much\nduplication as possible.\u201d The bank said that it wants to\nincrease its pretax profit at the unit to 1.7 billion euros in\n2015 from 800 million euros in 2011. The lender aims to reach 1\ntrillion euros of assets under management by 2015 at the unit.
