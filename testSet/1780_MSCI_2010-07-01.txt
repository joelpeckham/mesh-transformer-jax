The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n\u201cGlobal financial market returns\nstand at the threshold of mediocrity,\u201d according to  Bill Gross ,\nwho oversees the world\u2019s biggest bond fund. Investors have been\nthere before.  \n The CHART OF THE DAY shows the annual rates of return from\ninvesting 60 percent of assets in stocks and 40 percent in bonds\nover five-year periods. The percentages are a typical benchmark\nfor asset allocation. MSCI Inc.\u2019s  All Country World Index  and\nthe Barclays Capital  Global Aggregate Bond Index , two of the\nbroadest market gauges, were used in the calculations.  \n Last year\u2019s figure was 4 percent, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Five-year returns fell short of this\nthreshold four times earlier in the decade. They hit bottom at\n1.1 percent for the period ended in 2002, the same year that the\n1990s Internet bubble finished bursting.  \n Gross, co-chief investment officer of Pacific Investment\nManagement Co. and manager of its flagship Pimco Total Return\nFund, made the \u201cmediocrity\u201d reference in a monthly  commentary \nposted yesterday on Pimco\u2019s website.  \n Investors ought to expect \u201clow single digit\u201d percentage\nreturns on stocks annually, he wrote. As for bonds, yields of\nless than 3 percent on global indexes are a harbinger of their\nfuture performance, in his view. The Barclays Capital index had\na 2.54 percent  yield  as of yesterday.  \n Five-year returns averaged 11.7 percent during the second\nhalf of the 1990s, as the chart depicts. Since then, they have\nexceeded 10 percent only once: in 2007, the end of a five-year\nbull market for stocks.  \n (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nDavid Wilson in New York at \n dwilson@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 25.26591682434082 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
