 "context": "The following article called 'Nasdaq OMX Group Rallies to One-Month High After Beating Profit Estimates' was published on 2010-07-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNasdaq OMX Group Inc. , the owner of\nthe second-largest U.S. stock exchange, climbed to the highest\nlevel in more than a month after reporting second-quarter profit\nthat beat analyst estimates as trading revenue rose.  \n The shares  climbed  2.6 percent to $19.49 at 4 p.m. New York\ntime, the highest price since June 16. They have dropped 1.7\npercent in 2010,  compared  with an 8.7 percent slide in the\n FTSE/Mondo Visione Exchanges Index  that tracks 18 companies.  \n Earnings excluding charges were 52 cents a share, compared\nwith a 49-cent  average  forecast from 21 analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg. The exchange operator has raised its focus on\nderivatives, technology and Europe while cutting some\ntransaction fees to lure  business  as it faces heightened\ncompetition. Nasdaq, whose stock slumped 16 percent in the\nsecond quarter, has bought back $200 million of its shares since\nMarch and said today it increased the program by $100 million.  \n \u201cThe combination of the earnings beat and the upsized\nbuyback program\u201d drove today\u2019s share gains,  Alex Kramm , an\nanalyst at UBS AG in New York, wrote in a note to clients.\n\u201cStrong industry volumes clearly benefited the company in the\nquarter. However, positive pricing trends in the core U.S. cash\nequities business also contributed, which could mark a turning\npoint for the company if sustainable.\u201d  \n Operating Costs  \n Kramm has a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on the stock.  \n Operating expenses for 2010 will be $870 million to $885\nmillion, including $60 million in one-time items, the New York-\nbased owner of the Nasdaq Stock Market said in a statement\ntoday. Nasdaq took $16 million of charges \u201crelated to the\ndivestiture of businesses, expenses associated with severance,\nmerger and strategic initiatives, and other non-recurring\nitems\u201d in the quarter.  \n With the increase to $400 million for the share-buyback\nprogram, Nasdaq can still repurchase $200 million, according to\nthe statement. Revenue excluding liquidity rebates, brokerage,\nclearance and exchange fees climbed 6.3 percent to $390 million,\nboosting net income by 39 percent to $96 million.  \n \u201cOverall, a good, revenue-driven beat of consensus and\nincrementally positive buyback announcements should help Nasdaq\nshares outperform today,\u201d  Ed Ditmire , analyst at Macquarie\nGroup Ltd., said in a note to clients. There is \u201clikely follow-\nthrough if this leads to an upward bias to consensus.\u201d  \n Market Share  \n The company\u2019s U.S. equity market share slid to 22.8 percent\nlast quarter from 23.9 percent in the first three months,\naccording to the statement.  \n Separately today, Nasdaq, which also runs seven Nordic and\nBaltic bourses, agreed to buy Smarts Group, an Australian\nprovider of market surveillance technology, to diversify\nrevenue. The acquisition of Sydney-based Smarts will likely\nclose in the third quarter. Terms of the purchase weren\u2019t\ndisclosed. Smarts is privately held and sells its technology to\nexchanges, regulators and brokers.  \n The exchange expects to make about $32 million of revenue\nfrom market technology in the third quarter, Chief Financial\nOfficer  Adena Friedman  told analysts on a conference call today.  \n Deutsche Boerse AG , Europe\u2019s largest exchange operator by\nmarket value, reported net income of 160.8 million euros ($208.8\nmillion), more than the average of analyst estimates compiled by\nBloomberg.
