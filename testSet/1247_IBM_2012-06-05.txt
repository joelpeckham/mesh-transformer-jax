 "context": "The following article called 'Yahoo Said to Be in Talks to Resolve Facebook Patent Suit' was published on 2012-06-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nYahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  is in negotiations to\nresolve a legal dispute with  Facebook Inc. (FB) , which it accused of\ninfringing patents, according to a person briefed on the matter.  Yahoo has undergone board and management change since it\nfiled the lawsuit in March and is engaged in the talks to help\nimprove ties with Facebook, said the person, who didn\u2019t want to\nbe identified because the matter is private.  Under former Chief Executive Officer  Scott Thompson , Yahoo\nalleged that social-networking provider Facebook infringes\npatents covering such functions as Internet privacy, advertising\nand information sharing. Facebook countersued in April, accusing\nYahoo of infringing 10 of its patents. Thompson resigned the\nfollowing month, amid pressure from investors, after failing to\ncorrect misstatements in his academic record.  Caryn Marooney, a spokeswoman for Menlo Park, California-\nbased Facebook, declined to comment yesterday, as did Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman for Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo.  Facebook bulked up on intellectual property in the wake of\nthe Yahoo lawsuit. It said in April that it\u2019s paying $550\nmillion for some of the patents that  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  agreed to\nbuy from AOL Inc. Facebook also acquired patents from\n International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , a person with knowledge\nof the matter said in March.  Yahoo, in the lawsuit filed March 12 in federal court in\nSan Jose, California, sought an order barring Facebook from\ninfringing the 10 patents. It also sought triple damages.\nFacebook later accused Yahoo of infringing 10 patents through\nits home page and the Flickr-photo sharing service.  \u201cIf an unfavorable outcome were to occur in this\nlitigation, the impact could be material to our business,\nfinancial condition or results of operations,\u201d Facebook, which\nwent public last month, said in a March 27 filing.  The settlement talks were  reported  earlier this week in the\nAllThingsD blog.  The case is Yahoo! Inc. v. Facebook, 12-cv-01212, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).
