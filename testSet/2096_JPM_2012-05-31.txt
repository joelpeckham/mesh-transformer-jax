The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk\nclimbed for a second day as the number of Americans applying for\n unemployment benefits  rose last week to a one-month high.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a\ncredit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge\nagainst losses on corporate debt or to speculate on\ncreditworthiness, increased 1 basis point to a mid-price of\n123.3 basis points at 4:33 p.m. in New York, according to prices\ncompiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s the highest level since May 18 for\nthe index. Contracts tied to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  climbed by the\nmost in three weeks.  The index rose as the Labor Department said jobless claims\nin the U.S. increased by 10,000 to 383,000 in the week ended May\n26. The barometer pared most of its rise after a Greek opinion\npoll showed the nation\u2019s biggest pro-bailout party was leading\ngoing into elections on June 17.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be extraordinarily volatile through the\nGreek elections,\u201d said Mark Alexandridis, a portfolio manager\nat First Principles Capital Management, overseeing about $7.9\nbillion in fixed-income assets. \u201cNot only do you have this\nunstable situation in Europe but also tepid numbers coming out\nof the U.S.\u201d  The Labor Department initially reported the prior week\u2019s\napplications at 370,000. Last week\u2019s claims were the highest\nsince 392,000 in the week ended April 21.  Opinion Poll  In  Greece , the latest opinion poll conducted by Marc SA for\nAthens-based Alpha TV, contradicts a poll for Epikaira Magazine\nyesterday which showed the anti-bailout party Syriza in the\nlead.  The cost to protect against losses on the debt of JPMorgan\nrose by the most since May 11. Credit-default swaps on the New\nYork-based bank increased 12.4 basis points to 156.3 basis\npoints at 4:38 p.m., Bloomberg prices show.  The swaps gauge typically rises as investor confidence\ndeteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the\nbuyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,\nless the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals\n$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.
