The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIndia  needs more transparent rules\nto allow phone operators to merge, said Vladimir Evtushenkov,\nwhose  AFK Sistema (SSA)  is struggling to recover its wireless licenses\nas Russian President Vladimir Putin visits New Delhi.  \u201cThe industry can\u2019t be successful with a dozen operators\nfighting for a market share, it\u2019s clear that consolidation is\nneeded,\u201d the Russian billionaire said in an e-mailed response\nto questions. India\u2019s government needs more clarity in\nregulating the industry, including for mergers and acquisitions,\nhe said.  India\u2019s Supreme Court canceled 122 permits in February,\nprompting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh\u2019s government to alter\nairwave policy, requiring operators to bid at auctions that\ncollected less than a quarter of the planned $7.3 billion last\nmonth. The original allocation in 2008 had been corrupted by\n\u201cmoney power\u201d and some buyers\u2019 \u201cability to manipulate the\nsystem,\u201d the high court said.  Sistema unit Sistema Shyam TeleServices Ltd stayed away\nfrom the November auction and may now lose its license as soon\nas Jan. 18. Putin\u2019s visit to India for talks with Singh today\nmay help defend Sistema\u2019s position, according to Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie Capital in Moscow. Sistema\nShyam is 17 percent owned by the Russian government.  Appealing Ruling  Sistema is appealing the court decision and wants its\nlicenses returned. The Russian company is among operators\nincluding  Norway \u2019s Telenor ASA, Emirates Telecommunications\nCorp., or Etisalat, and Indian billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla\u2019s Idea Cellular Ltd. that lost permits. In the November\nauction, companies including Vodafone Group Plc and Bharti\nAirtel Ltd. avoided nationwide licenses and concessions in two\nof the biggest cities, New Delhi and  Mumbai , because of high\nprices.  \u201cOur situation is special,\u201d Evtushenkov said. \u201cIn 2008,\nSistema Shyam was the only operator seeking a pan-Indian CDMA\nspectrum. India\u2019s controller and auditor general never said that\nCDMA frequencies were in such high demand as the GSM ones.\u201d  Sistema\u2019s talks with India are continuing, Evtushenkov told\nreporters in New Delhi today.  Sistema is set to buy Aircel Cellular Ltd., a unit of\n Malaysia \u2019s Maxis Communications Bhd, for $3 billion, to expand\nin India, the Economic Times newspaper reported on Sept. 14,\nciting unidentified people.  Positioning System  Evtushenkov declined to discuss strategic plans for India\nuntil the decision on the company\u2019s appeal is made. Indian\nlegislation makes it unclear whether a company that acquires a\nlicense holder will retain the permit, according to Sistema.  Sistema\u2019s shares advanced 0.4 percent to 24.5 rubles at\n12:30 p.m. in Moscow.  During Putin\u2019s visit, another Sistema\u2019s unit, NIS, may sign\nagreements with Indian fixed-line operator Bharat Sanchar Nigam\nLtd. and an information-technology company  Tata Consultancy\nServices Ltd (TCS)  on providing navigation services based on a Russian\nglobal-positioning system with local partners, NIS said.  Russia is trying to challenge U.S. dominance in space-based\nnavigation systems. The country has spent at least  $3.3 billion \nin the last decade to develop its Glonass system with 24\nsatellites. It\u2019s an alternative to GPS which was first developed\nby the U.S. Department of Defense and then spread to civilian\napplications such as mobile phones and transport monitoring.
