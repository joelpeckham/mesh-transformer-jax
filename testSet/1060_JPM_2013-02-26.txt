 "context": "The following article called 'Currency Veteran Kuroda Offers BOJ Credibility on Reflation' was published on 2013-02-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Bank of Japan may pack a bigger\npunch under Haruhiko Kuroda, an opponent of deflation who ran\nthe nation\u2019s currency policy and then built an international\nreputation leading the Asian Development Bank.  Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters yesterday\nKuroda, 68, would be a \u201ccorrect\u201d choice as next BOJ chief,\nnoting an international finance background. Two people familiar\nwith the discussions earlier said Kuroda is Prime Minister\nShinzo Abe\u2019s pick for the post. Kuroda was in charge of foreign-\nexchange issues at the Ministry of Finance from 1999 to 2003.  While outgoing Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  established a 76\ntrillion yen ($808 billion) asset-purchase fund and an unlimited\nbank-loan financing program, he failed to encourage  inflation\nexpectations , instead warning repeatedly about the dangers of\nexcess stimulus. By contrast, Kuroda called for an inflation\ntarget a decade before the bank adopted one in January, and for\nyears has spoken in favor of quantitative easing.  \u201cHe\u2019s the right person to enhance the role of\ncommunication strategy at the Bank of Japan,\u201d said Masaaki Kanno, chief Japan economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  Tokyo \nand a former head foreign-exchange dealer at the BOJ. \u201cHe has\nalready said in press interviews that the 2 percent inflation\ntarget should be achieved in two years -- this is a very\nimportant message to the market.\u201d  Market Welcome  Investors welcomed the nomination reports, with the yen\nyesterday reaching its lowest against the dollar since May 2010\non prospects for more stimulus. It later rallied amid haven\ndemand stemming from concern  Italy \u2019s election failed to produce\na majority winner. It was at 92.39 as of 12:08 p.m. in Tokyo.  Japan\u2019s benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  closed at the\nhighest in almost 4 1/2 years yesterday, when five-year bond\nyields fell to a record 0.12 percent, amid forecasts the BOJ\nwill start purchasing longer-dated securities. The Nikkei today\nlost 1.4 percent at the midday break in Tokyo.  Heading the BOJ would cap a 45-year-career that includes a\nsecondment to Washington with the International Monetary Fund, a\nstint as adviser to former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and\na master\u2019s degree from Oxford University.  Born on the southern island of Kyushu in 1944, Kuroda\nentered the Ministry of Finance in 1967 after graduating from\nthe University of Tokyo with a degree in law. As a young\nbureaucrat, he was sent to Oxford, where he studied economics\nunder Nobel Prize winner John Hicks.  Oxford Lesson  Kuroda said in a 2006 interview with the IMF that at Oxford\nhe was taught \u201calthough economic theory may provide some\ninsight, some framework, good policies may require something\nthat goes beyond just economy theory or analysis -- some\npractical judgment, some good sense.\u201d  His dream was to be a teacher, according to the IMF\nprofile, an objective he fulfilled for a time as a professor at\nTokyo\u2019s Hitotsubashi University after he left the Finance\nMinistry in 2003. While at the ministry, he wrote a paper titled\n\u201cSocrates: The Dollar Dialogue,\u201d in which the ancient Greek\nphilosopher muses on the efforts by international policy makers\nto manage foreign exchange rates.  Kuroda rose to become vice finance minister for\ninternational affairs, the senior official in charge of foreign-\nexchange issues, from 1999 to 2003. He succeeded  Eisuke Sakakibara , who was known as \u201cMr. Yen\u201d for his ability to\ninfluence the currency markets with his comments.  BOJ Thinking  It was in the capacity as currency-policy chief that Kuroda\nhoned his sense that monetary policy ought to be deployed more\nforcefully against what at the time were the first years of\nJapan\u2019s  deflation . Consumer-price declines set in in the late\n1990s as banks constricted lending, seeking to fix balance\nsheets mauled by the destruction of burst bubbles in the stock\nand real-estate markets.  He wrote a 2002  opinion piece , along with colleague\nMasahiro Kawai, urging the BOJ to adopt a 3 percent inflation\ngoal and to continually increase the monetary base through asset\npurchases. Kuroda also oversaw bouts of foreign-exchange\nintervention, selling yen as the currency appreciated.  \u201cKuroda has certainly been out there for a decade saying\nmore could be done by the  Bank of Japan (8301) , so he\u2019s got\ncredibility,\u201d said Richard Jerram, chief economist at Bank of\nSingapore Ltd. \u201cThe requirements of what they need to do has\nbeen made clear. The outcome is going to be large-scale\npurchases of Japanese government bonds.\u201d  Deflation Opponent  Kuroda explained in an interview this month that falling\nprices exacerbate real debt burdens, and give the incentive to\ncompanies and households to postpone spending. Consumer prices\nexcluding fresh food fell 0.2 percent in December. The price\ngauge hasn\u2019t advanced 2 percent for any year since 1997, when a\nnational sales tax was increased.  Leading the ADB since 2005, Kuroda has had a seat at\ninternational economic gatherings and observed from abroad how\nthe BOJ for years resisted establishing an inflation target.\nShirakawa and his colleagues on the current board took the step\nof setting a 2 percent goal last month, acting weeks after the\nelection of Abe on a platform of reflation.  Shirakawa, 63, sought to damp impulses to press the central\nbank into extraordinary easing in the aftermath of the March 11,\n2011 earthquake and tsunami, warning that any move to underwrite\ngovernment debt would lead to sharp inflation and damage to\npeople\u2019s livelihoods.  Confirmation Process  Kuroda would need to be confirmed by both houses of\nparliament should Abe nominate him. The Democratic Party of\n Japan , the largest party in the upper house -- where the ruling\nLiberal Democratic Party lacks a majority -- is ready to approve\nAbe\u2019s selections, the Nikkei newspaper reported.  The government will present Abe\u2019s nominees to executives of\nthe lower and upper house parliamentary affairs committee as\nsoon as Feb. 28., according to a ruling coalition official who\nasked not be named as the discussions are private.  Abe is likely to tap Kikuo Iwata, an academic who has urged\na ramping up in Japan\u2019s monetary base to end deflation, and\nsenior BOJ official Hiroshi Nakaso, as deputy governors,\naccording to one government official and a ruling coalition\nexecutive, who asked not to be named as the talks are private.  The ADB chief, who enjoys swimming and reading detective\nnovels in his spare time, has overseen a tripling in the Manila-\nbased development lender\u2019s capital base, to $165 billion, and\nenlarged its lending window for the cheapest loans to members.  Should he win the BOJ post, he will be tasked with\nimplementing Abe\u2019s vision for aggressive monetary easing and\ncommunicating it to global leaders concerned about the impact on\na falling yen.  \u2018Substantial\u2019 Room  In a Feb. 11 interview, Kuroda advocated additional\nstimulus this year, saying the central bank has \u201creally\nsubstantial room for monetary easing.\u201d He also said that the\nglobal standard for achieving inflation targets was a two-year\ntime horizon. When the BOJ set a 2 percent inflation target\nwithout a deadline in January, it said it would start open-ended\nasset purchases starting in 2014.  Japan\u2019s government bond yield curve is pricing in Kuroda\u2019s\nsuccess in adopting more aggressive easing while failing to\nreach 2 percent inflation. The extra yield investors demand to\nhold 30-year JGBs instead of 5-year notes slid to 1.78\npercentage points from the seven-year high of 1.86 earlier this\nmonth, reflecting speculation of increased BOJ debt purchases\nand that the buying will do little to spur consumer prices.  The yen has weakened more than 11 percent since the LDP\nregained power in December, vowing to push the BOJ to boost\nstimulus. Group of 20 finance ministers this month signaled\nsupport for Japan\u2019s policies as long as Abe\u2019s policy makers end\nany public endorsement of a declining currency.  Abe\u2019s Threat  Abe has retained the threat of changing the law governing\nthe BOJ should the central bank fail to meet inflation targets,\nraising the risk of diminishing the institution\u2019s independence.\nEven so, by burnishing the bank\u2019s reputation, that may be less\nof a danger under Kuroda.  \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t independence, the issue is\naccountability,\u201d said Robert Feldman, head of Japan economic\nresearch at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. \u201cKuroda has to\ngo back to the international community to win back its trust,\nand I think he will. I can\u2019t think of a better candidate to head\nthe BOJ.\u201d  Kuroda must now implement what he has advocated in bringing\nJapan out of its deflationary spiral.  \u201cHe is an excellent choice,\u201d said retired Yale University\nprofessor Koichi Hamada, an adviser who breakfasted with Abe\nlast week at Blair House, across the street from the White House\nin  Washington . \u201cHe understands Abenomics well,\u201d Hamada told\nreporters yesterday in Tokyo when asked about Kuroda.
