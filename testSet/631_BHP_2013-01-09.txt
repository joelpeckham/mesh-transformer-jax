 "context": "The following article called 'Fortescue Leads Junk Miners to Best From Worst: Australia Credit' was published on 2013-01-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJunk bonds  from Australian miners\nwent to best from worst last month, as  Fortescue Metals Group\nLtd. (FMG)  rallied the most in a year after mining bans in  India  and\nimprovement in  China\u2019s economy  pushed up iron-ore prices.  The debt handed investors a 4.2 percent return in December,\nthe best among six nationalities in the Bank of America Merrill\nLynch U.S. High Yield Metals & Mining index. The notes gained\n2.1 percent in the five months ended Nov. 30, the worst\nperformance. Fortescue\u2019s notes climbed 4.5 percent last month,\nthe best performance since January 2012, the data show.  Iron ore ,  Australia \u2019s biggest export, has rebounded 83 \npercent since slumping to a three-year low in September. The \nplunge forced Fortescue to seek $5 billion in new loans to lower\ndebt costs. Since then,  China  boosted spending on subways, \nsewers and roads and carried out a leadership transition, easing \nfears of a sudden end to the mining boom that helped Australia \nevade recession for more than two decades.  \u201cSentiment has improved as everyone feels less grief and\nconcern about the new government in China,\u201d  Tom Price , a\nSydney-based commodity analyst at UBS AG, said by phone. \u201cThe\ndemand side looks stable, there\u2019s no macro constraint. The big\nshock on ore trade will probably relate to the supply side --\ncyclones are one, India is definitely a factor running at 50\npercent normal capacity.\u201d  Indian Ban  India\u2019s  Supreme Court  has banned  iron ore  production at 93\nmines in Goa after a probe found that mining had contaminated\nground water and led to illegal logging. The ruling has helped\nshore up prices at a time of year when demand typically\nstrengthens. Exports from Australia\u2019s Pilbara region, where\nFortescue,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group operate iron-\nore mines, are susceptible to disruptions from cyclones, which\ntypically hit during November to April.  A gauge of China\u2019s manufacturing activity released Jan. 1\nshowed a third month of expansion, adding to evidence that the\nrecovery in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy will extend into\nthe new year. The  Purchasing Managers \u2019 Index was 50.6 in\nDecember, while a reading above 50 indicates expansion. The\nreport reflects increased infrastructure spending that\u2019s helping\ndrive a rebound from a seven-quarter slowdown as a new\ngeneration of Communist Party leaders takes the nation\u2019s reins.  China Recovery  \u201cThe normal seasonal restocking of raw material feeding\ninto the  steel industry  will become most active from Chinese New\nYear though to about the middle of this year,\u201d said Price,\nreferring to the Lunar New Year holidays around Feb. 10.\n\u201cCyclone season in the Pilbara will have some impact, there\ncould be shock impacts on the delivery of ore to  Asia . What\u2019s\nprobably going to have a much bigger impact is India.\u201d  Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology is tracking cyclone\nNarelle, which may become a severe tropical cyclone as it moves\ntowards coastal areas where  Port Hedland , the world\u2019s biggest\n iron-ore  port, is located.  India exported 33.1 million tons in the first 11 months,\nfor a 4.9 percent market share of China\u2019s imports, down from 11\npercent in 2011 and 21 percent in 2007, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg  Iron ore for delivery to China\u2019s Tianjin port jumped 31\npercent over the past month to $158.50 per metric ton, the\nhighest level since October 2011, according to The Steel Index\nLtd. The rally has spurred a drop in Australian  government bonds \nand prompted traders to reduce bets that the central bank will\ndrop  interest rates  to a record this quarter.  Yields Rising  Benchmark 10-year yields rose to a 4 1/2-month high of 3.47\npercent on Jan. 7, and were at 3.40 percent yesterday in Sydney,\nor 152 basis points higher than similar-dated U.S. Treasuries.  Traders see a 39 percent probability the  Reserve Bank  will\nreduce the benchmark rate to 2.75 percent at its next board\nmeeting on Feb. 5, down from a 59 percent chance on Dec. 31,\naccording to  interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bond investors are favoring Fortescue\u2019s high-yield bonds\nafter the miner cut costs with $5 billion in new loans that\nhelped to extend its maturity profile, with the first debt not\nmaturing until 2015.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Fortescue\u2019s $1.5\nbillion of November 2019 notes rather than similar-dated\nTreasuries shrank to 552 basis points on Jan. 8, the lowest\nsince May, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system\nof the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The premium\nreached a record 810 on Sept. 6.  Kings Deposit  Australia\u2019s third-biggest iron ore exporter said last month\nit\u2019s resuming work on the Kings deposit as commodity prices\nrose, after putting the new mine on hold following the September\nprice plunge. A potential plan to sell part of its rail\ninfrastructure could fetch more than $4 billion,  Michael Evans ,\na resources analyst with CIMB Securities (Australia) Ltd., said\nlast month.  \u201cHigher iron ore prices are driving Fortescue\u2019s bond\nperformance,\u201d Ben Byrne, credit sector specialist at Citigroup\nInc. in Sydney, said by phone. \u201cThe other factor is their\nsecured loan they negotiated in September, which improved their\nliquidity. The infrastructure asset sales that they\u2019re looking\nat will also potentially improve their liquidity, should they\noccur.\u201d  Fortescue and other high-yield mining bond issuers are also\nbenefiting from investors allocating cash at the start of the\nnew year.  \u201cIn the current credit environment, a lot of cash needs to\nbe put to work in the new year,\u201d Chris Walter, a Sydney-based\ncredit research analyst at Westpac Banking Corp., said by phone.\n\u201cThere is a large number of investors looking to get their\nmoney to work.\u201d  Iron ore\u2019s recovery -- while expected to cool from levels\nabove $155 a ton to average $120 a ton during the quarter -- has\nleft producers on surer footing and boosted  earnings forecasts .  \u201cThe return to a more-normalized, high-price environment is \nlikely to place iron-ore producers on a more positive footing,\" \nNomura Holdings Inc. analysts  David Radclyffe  and David Cotterell wrote in a Jan. 7 report.
