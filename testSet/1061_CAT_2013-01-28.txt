The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEmory Williams, former chairman of\nERA Mining Machinery Ltd., was \u201cshocked and dismayed\u201d to learn\nof  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) \u2019s writedown at its China unit, according to\nan e-mailed statement today.  Caterpillar, the world\u2019s largest maker of construction and\nmining equipment, said on Jan. 18 it will take a $580 million\nwritedown after discovering accounting misconduct at Zhengzhou\nSiwei Mechanical & Electrical Manufacturing Co., a company\nbought as part of Caterpillar\u2019s $793 million acquisition of ERA\nMining in November 2011.  The non-cash goodwill impairment charge will reduce fourth-\nquarter earnings by about 87 cents a share, Peoria, Illinois-\nbased Caterpillar said in a statement. Senior managers at Siwei\nwho were found to be responsible for the \u201cdeliberate, multi-\nyear, coordinated accounting misconduct\u201d were removed and a new\nleadership team put in place, the company said.  Caterpillar acquired ERA Mining, Siwei\u2019s parent company, to\ngain factories that make underground coal-mining equipment in\n China , the world\u2019s largest coal producer. The irregularities\nfound at Siwei are the latest setback for Caterpillar in China,\nafter it said in April that it was moving unsold excavators to\nother countries amid excess inventory.  \u201cWe were especially surprised by this situation as we\ncooperated very closely with the Caterpillar team during their\nextensive due diligence,\u201d Williams said in the statement. \u201cOur\nsurprise is compounded by the fact that, as directors of ERA\nprior to the acquisition by Caterpillar, when it was a Hong Kong\nlisted company, we took the company\u2019s fiduciary and reporting\nresponsibilities very seriously.\u201d  Caterpillar hasn\u2019t responded to a request last week for\nmore information, Williams said in the statement.
