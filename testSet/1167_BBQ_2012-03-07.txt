The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n(Corrects restaurant owner\u2019s name in 10th paragraph.)  A  New York City  Council survey of\n1,397 restaurants found that even among establishments the\nHealth Department rates \u201cA\u201d for compliance, owners say\ninspectors lack consistency, fairness and expertise.  Council Speaker  Christine Quinn , a Manhattan Democrat, said\ntoday she agreed with Mayor  Michael Bloomberg \u2019s policy to assign\nand display letter grades showing results of restaurant health\ninspections, yet owners\u2019 complaints and  survey  responses show\nproblems in how the department has run the program.  Scott Rosenberg, co-owner of Sushi Yasuda, said an\ninspector destroyed a $10,000 piece of tuna last year after a\nchef prepared the fish with bare hands, as chefs have done for\nhundreds of years. His restaurant, rated among the city\u2019s best\nin several reviews, has consistently received a top \u201cA\u201d grade\nfrom the Health Department,  \u201cThere was no listening to any explanation,\u201d Rosenberg\nsaid at a City Hall news conference hosted by Quinn. \u201cIt just\ngoes to their training and education. I\u2019m sure the inspectors\nare not getting sufficient training on a consistent level.\u201d  John Kelly , the Health Department\u2019s chief spokesman, said\nthe council\u2019s survey \u201cseems to serve more as a complaint box\u201d\nfor the industry. As for preparing sushi with bare hands, Kelly\nsaid, \u201cDoctors perform brain surgery while wearing gloves. We\nunderstand tradition, but our aim is to minimize exposure to\ncontamination.\u201d  Concern About Jobs  Dining establishments provide jobs for about 190,000 people\nin New York City, according to the state Labor Department, part\nof a leisure and hospitality industry employing 336,000.\nBloomberg has promoted the industry with an international\nmarketing campaign aimed at diversifying the city\u2019s economy.  \u201cWe cannot engage in governmental behavior that is going\nto cost us jobs that are just too hard to create,\u201d Quinn, 46,\nsaid before convening a City Council hearing on the inspections.\nThe issue, she said, \u201cis how you keep the public safe and\nhealthy in restaurants but do it in a way that supports\nrestaurants, not penalizes them.\u201d  The council hearing had been scheduled before Bloomberg\nheld a news conference yesterday where he credited the letter-\ngrading system for a 14 percent drop in reported food-borne\nillness from salmonella bacteria last year.  The survey found that among participants who received the\nhighest grade, 66 percent rated the inspection and letter-\ngrading system \u201cpoor,\u201d and 68 percent said it had increased\ntheir cost of doing business.  Less Profit  \u201cEverybody in our industry is taking less profit home,\u201d\nsaid Herb Wetanson, who owns 10 restaurants the department has\nrated \u201cA,\u201d including Dallas BBQ. \u201cThe workers suffer, we\ncan\u2019t offer them a raise, but we can\u2019t pass on the cost to the\npublic one dollar,\u201d he told reporters before the hearing.  The department should consider creating an ombudsman to\nwhom restaurant owners could complain, and abandoning uniforms\nthat risk alarming diners, said Quinn, who is organizing for a\npossible 2013 campaign for mayor. Periodic meetings between\ndepartment policy makers and owners would improve communication,\nshe said.  The council survey shouldn\u2019t be considered a scientific\ndocument, Quinn said. Instead, it should be used to improve the\nsystem.  \u201cThis is about a concept of a system that we in the\ncouncil support, but we want to make sure it\u2019s fair, it\u2019s\nconsistent, it\u2019s honest, it\u2019s truthful and it\u2019s done in a way\nthat isn\u2019t about revenue generation but about giving the public\ninformation it needs,\u201d Quinn said.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News\nparent Bloomberg LP.
