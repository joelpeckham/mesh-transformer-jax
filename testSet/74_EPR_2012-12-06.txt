 "context": "The following article called 'EDF France Reactor Cost Rise May Pressure U.K. Power Price Talks' was published on 2012-12-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nElectricite de France SA \u2019s 2.5\nbillion-euro ($3.3 billion) cost overrun at a French reactor\nwill probably influence talks with the U.K. government over\npaying for nuclear projects in  England .  The announcement earlier this week may be a tool to secure\na better power price for a reactor in the U.K., Liberum Capital\nLtd. said. The cost of building EDF\u2019s EPR reactor at Flamanville\nin Normandy has more than doubled to 8.5 billion euros because\nof changes to its design after  Japan \u2019s Fukushima disaster.  EDF is negotiating with the U.K. government on a guaranteed\nprice for atomic power. The Paris-based company expects to make\nan  investment decision  by the end of the year. Parliament is\ndebating legislation published last week designed to encourage\nEDF and other investors to build 110 billion pounds ($177\nbillion) of generation capacity and grid upgrades.  \u201cThis is all part of a backdrop to use their misfortune in\n France  in a positive way to get a very high price out of the\nU.K. government,\u201d Tony Roulstone, director of the University of\nCambridge\u2019s nuclear energy masters program, said by phone. It\u2019s\npart of the \u201cnegotiating in public\u201d over the price.  EDF Energy, the French utility\u2019s U.K. unit, owns eight\nexisting nuclear plants in the U.K. and will build the country\u2019s\nfirst new reactor since the 1990s if the Hinkley Point project\nin Somerset gets the final go-ahead.  Dominic Nash, a utilities analyst at Liberum, said he\ndidn\u2019t think \u201cit is any coincidence that they\u2019ve announced this\ntowards the end of the year.\u201d  Fair Price  The government would only reach an agreement on a strike\nprice that is fair, affordable and is consistent with the\ngovernment\u2019s policy of no public subsidy for new nuclear, an\nofficial at the  Department of Energy  said by e-mail. EDF Energy\ndeclined to comment on negotiations.  EDF and the government haven\u2019t said what power price is\nunder discussion for Hinkley point. The so-called strike price\nwill be written into a contract for difference that guarantees a\nminimum price for power regardless of prevailing market\nconditions. The contract mitigates the risk involved in building\na nuclear reactor, which are far more expensive to construct\nthan other  power plants .  John Hayes , an energy minister, said Britain would\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d refuse a deal that placed too great a burden on\nconsumers who ultimately fit the bill.  Business Case  Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive officer of U.K. unit EDF\nEnergy, said on Oct. 23 that a more compelling business case was\nneeded before the company makes a final investment decision. He\ntold lawmakers reports EDF wants a strike price of 140 pounds a\nmegawatt-hour, more than double today\u2019s market rate, were\n \u201cutterly rubbish.\u201d   \u201cThis should allow EDF to ask for a price that covers the\ncost of construction of new nuclear build based on the\nexperience of the group in France,\u201d  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) \nanalysts said in a note.  Hayes told lawmakers this week the strike price would be\nknown by the middle of next year.  \u201cNo one has a clue of the costs required to build nuclear.\nI think that nuclear could be prohibitively expensive,\u201d\nLiberum\u2019s Nash said. \u201cIf your glass is half full you\u2019d say that\nthe first-of-the-kind pain that EDF is going through should mean\nthat they won\u2019t necessarily replicate those errors.\u201d  EDF will use reactors made by  Areva SA (AREVA) , which said this\nweek EDF\u2019s new estimate at the Flamanville reactor \u201cis not\nrepresentative of the price of an EPR reactor in the series\noffered in the market today.\u201d  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:\nSally Bakewell in London at \n Sbakewell1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nReed Landberg at \n landberg@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of EPR Properties was 27.390949249267578 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of EPR Properties was ",
