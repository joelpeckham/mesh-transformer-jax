 "context": "The following article called 'Ginia Rinehart Loses Bid for Mediation of Trust Dispute' was published on 2012-09-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAn Australian judge rejected a bid\nby the youngest daughter of  Gina Rinehart ,  Asia \u2019s richest woman,\nto have a family dispute over a multibillion-dollar trust moved\nfrom court to private mediation.  New South Wales Supreme Court Justice Paul Brereton\nyesterday rejected the request from Ginia Rinehart, who has\nsided with her mother, saying \u201cthere is little to indicate\u201d\nthe dispute could be successfully resolved in mediation.  Hope Rinehart Welker, Bianca Rinehart and  John Hancock  sued\ntheir 58-year-old mother in Australian state court last\nSeptember, accusing her of misconduct by threatening their\nfinancial ruin and breach of trust. They want her removed as\ntrustee of the Hope Margaret Hancock Trust, which holds 23.45\npercent of the voting shares of Hancock Prospecting Pty and may\nbe worth as much as $4.5 billion.  Gina Rinehart\u2019s lawyer David Russell yesterday pressed\nBrereton to throw out the lawsuit, after the bid for mediation\nwas rejected, saying Gina Rinehart has complied with all demands\nmade by the children, including having agreed to turn over the\nshares when they request them.  Pursuing the lawsuit further is \u201csimply a matter of\nspite,\u201d Russell said.  Brereton reserved his decision on the request, giving no\nindication of when he may rule.  Gina Rinehart inherited  iron ore  mining assets from her\nfather,  Lang Hancock , and has an agreement with  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) \nunder which she collects royalties on properties in  Western\nAustralia  mined by Rio. She agreed last year to sell coal\nprojects in Queensland to  GVK Power & Infrastructure Ltd. (GVKP)  for\n$2.2 billion.  Capital Gains  Gina Rinehart is ranked 33rd wealthiest person in the world\nby the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index , with an estimated net worth\nof $19.3 billion.  Welker, Bianca Rinehart and Hancock were instilled with\nfear by their mother that they\u2019d have to pay capital gains taxes\non the shares when they acquire them, said Andrew Bell, a lawyer\nrepresenting the children.  Jay Newby, chief financial officer of Hancock Prospecting,\nsaid in a Sept. 4, 2011, e-mail to Bianca that based on her\nstake, then valued at A$600 million ($630 million), she would\nhave to pay about A$142 million in  capital gains  taxes.  Bankruptcy Risk  Gina Rinehart had warned Bianca in an e-mail last year that\nacquiring the shares could force the children into bankruptcy\nbecause the stock can\u2019t be sold outside the family or used as\ncollateral for loans, according to the company\u2019s constitution.  Based on additional advice and a review of a\nPriceWaterhouseCoopers report Gina Rinehart had, it\u2019s evident\nthere is no risk of bankruptcy now, Bell said.  The tax office has six years to make a final decision\nhowever, and the children will have the risk of a tax liability\nhanging over them, Bell said.  Gina Rinehart\u2019s threats to the children, including a\nwarning in a recent e-mail that said \u201cif you verify the\nstatement of claim, that will be held against you all your\nlife,\u201d has revealed her character, Bell said.  \u201cWhat she has done is to reveal herself as wholly\nunsuitable to continue as the trustee,\u201d Bell said. It shows\nshe\u2019s prepared to resort to \u201cdishonesty and deceit\u201d to get her\nway, he said.  The case is Hope Rinehart Welker v Gina Rinehart.\n2011/285907.
