 "context": "The following article called 'Miners\u2019 Iron-Ore Pricing Evolution Curbs Demand for Swaps Trade' was published on 2010-10-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDemand for iron-ore swaps has dropped\nfollowing this year\u2019s shift away from a four-decade old pricing\nsystem toward shorter-term contracts and a lack of interest from\nsteelmaking consumers of the ore, analysts said.  \u201cThe system has changed, there is no going back and I\nthink the bottleneck is: the steel mills don\u2019t really understand\nor want to use swaps at the moment,\u201d said  Jim Lennon , executive\ndirector of commodities and mining research at Macquarie Group\nLtd. in London. Uptake of swaps will \u201ctake time,\u201d he said.  The world\u2019s biggest iron ore exporters this year scrapped a\ncustom of pricing cargoes in 12-month periods, replacing it with\nquarterly contracts based on the average  price  over three\nmonths. More iron ore is shipped across oceans than any other\ndry bulk commodity, with the market forecast by Credit Suisse\nGroup AG to total 1 billion metric tons this year.  Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse started offering iron-\nore swaps in 2008 as a means for market participants including\nproducers, mills and consumers to lock in prices, reducing the\nrisk of market fluctuations. Trade in the derivative contracts\nwas 40 percent lower in September than in April, according to\ndata from  SGX AsiaClear , the securities and derivatives exchange\nof Singapore Exchange Ltd.  Missing Liquidity  \u201cWhat\u2019s missing at the moment on the derivatives market\nright now is liquidity,\u201d  Michael Widmer , head of metal markets\nresearch at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London, said at a\nconference in the city yesterday. \u201cAn evolving pricing system\non the physical market is clearly not conducive\u201d to boosting\ndemand for swaps, he said.  Swaps peaked in April with 4,436 lots traded for a volume\nof 2.2 million tons, according to SGX Asiaclear data posted on\nits website. The volume for September was 2,682 lots, or 1.3\nmillion tons, the data show.  \u201cWe\u2019ve sort of plateaued recently and I guess some people\nare arguing: is this a sign that there are fundamental issues,\nand I\u2019d argue definitely not,\u201d  Ray Key , Deutsche Bank\u2019s global\nhead of metal trading, who helped develop the swaps product,\nsaid yesterday at the same conference. \u201cThere is a major battle\ngoing on and the psyches of the steel mills, the producers and\nthe end consumers are grappling with these issues.\u201d  Quarterly prices are calculated based on the average price\nover the preceding three months with a one-month lag. Contract\nprices fell 11 percent to $129 a ton in the quarter that began\nOct. 1 from the previous three months, said Hu Kai, an analyst\nat UC361.com, citing Platts index prices.  Raw-Material Costs  The China import  price  rose 0.2 percent to $141.40 a ton\nyesterday, according to The Steel Index. Steelmakers use about\n1.6 tons of iron ore and 0.5 tons of coking coal to make 1 ton\nof steel. Raw materials account for as much as 75 percent of\nproduction costs for mills, according to JPMorgan Cazenove.  Vale\nSA ,  Rio Tinto Group  and  BHP Billiton Ltd.  are the three biggest\nexporters.  The current pricing situation is \u201ca half-way house driven\nby the desire by the steel mills not to hedge, they don\u2019t want\nto be involved in it,\u201d Macquarie\u2019s Lennon said yesterday.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get the steel mills and the industry involved in\nunderstanding how to use these tools.\u201d  ArcelorMittal , the world\u2019s largest steelmaker, last week\nsaid it isn\u2019t relying on forward contracts and is looking to\nshare price volatility with customers. ThyssenKrupp AG,\nGermany\u2019s biggest steelmaker, said in April it was \u201cdeveloping\ninstruments\u201d to hedge iron ore supplies and reduce the effects\nof swings in prices.  Enforced Change  \u201cThere are fierce debates going on between steel mills,\nthe auto sector,\u201d Deutsche Bank\u2019s Key said. \u201cOne way or the\nother, there is going to be a change forced upon someone.\nRegardless of how it goes, people are going to start hedging\nbecause they need to.\u201d  BHP , the world\u2019s biggest mining company, said last week it\nexpects a shift toward monthly pricing accords as they better\nreflect the market and the needs of producers and consumers.\nRivals Vale and London-based Rio last month voiced different\nviews on a switch to shorter contracts.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had really quite an amazing change in the way that\nthe market works, particularly physically and of course we are\nstill within the transformation,\u201d  Kamal Naqvi , director of\ncommodities at Credit Suisse, said yesterday. \u201cThere really is\nno other commodity that is embedded in the outlook for\nindustrial demand more broadly than iron ore.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Jesse Riseborough  in London at \n jriseborough@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAmanda Jordan at \n ajordan11@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was 50.2052116394043 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was ",
