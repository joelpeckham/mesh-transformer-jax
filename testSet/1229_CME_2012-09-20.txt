 "context": "The following article called 'Oil Three-Minute Slide Vexes Vitol as Traders Remain Stumped' was published on 2012-09-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOil\u2019s three-minute plunge yesterday has left traders and analysts from Vitol Group to Commerzbank AG perplexed about the cause.  Crude futures tumbled almost $4 a barrel between 1:51 p.m. and 1:54 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, driving prices to their biggest one-day decline in two months. David Fransen, chief executive officer of Vitol\u2019s Geneva unit, said today he didn\u2019t know what was behind the drop.  Eugen Weinberg , head of commodities research at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , described the decline as \u201cmysterious.\u201d  West Texas Intermediate for October settlement settled 2.4 percent lower yesterday at $96.62 a barrel after trading in a range of almost $5 on the Nymex. The contract fell 47 cents to $96.15 as of 10:22 a.m. local time. Brent slid 2.5 percent in the previous session to $113.79 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London and extended its decline to $113.60 today.  \u201cIt is difficult not to view this sell-off as technical trading or high-frequency trading on dope,\u201d  Olivier Jakob , managing director at Petromatrix GmbH in Zug,  Switzerland , said in a note today. \u201cWith some market participants on holiday for Rosh Hashanah we can speculate that there were probably some resting stop orders below $115 a barrel which could have helped trigger the move, which then accelerated,\u201d he said, refering to Brent crude futures.  The drop came amid speculation that the U.S. is planning to tap its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. President  Barack Obama \u2019s administration hasn\u2019t changed its position, and \u201call options remain on the table,\u201d  Jay Carney , a government spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Saudi Arabia  is taking action to reduce the price of oil by pumping about 10 million barrels a day, a Persian Gulf official with knowledge of the matter said today.  SPR Release  \u201cThere were persistent concerns about a potential strategic oil-reserve release that dominated the market yesterday,\u201dMyrto Sokou, an analyst at Sucden Financial Ltd. in London, said in a note today.  The speed and magnitude of the price drop may draw the attention of regulators concerned about high-frequency trading and the influence of speculators on commodity markets, according to Weinberg. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in  Washington  said yesterday it will look into the decline.  High-frequency trading uses complex computer programs to execute orders in milliseconds and profit from fleeting discrepancies in security prices across different trading venues. It came under regulatory scrutiny after the so-called flash crash in May 2010, during which the Dow Jones Industrial Average briefly lost almost 1,000 points.  \u2018Raises Antennas\u2019  \u201cWhen price and volume move so fast and so dramatically, it raises our antennas immediately,\u201d CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton said. \u201cWe need to get a quick visual on what happened and why. In this sort of circumstance, I always want to know what the cheetah traders, the high-frequency traders, were doing.\u201d  Commissioner  Scott O\u2019Malia  said the CFTC is contacting CME Group Inc., owner of the Nymex, and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. to find out more.  The price decline may have been a reaction to the  European Central Bank \u2019s decision not to buy as many bonds as anticipated in its efforts to shore up the euro, Fransen said at a presentation to the British-Swiss Chamber of Commerce in Geneva today. Sudden, unexpected movements can also be caused by algorithmic trading, he said.  \u2018Profit-Taking Strategy\u2019  About 7 percent of the trading volume on WTI was during the slump, or 20,785 lots, Nymex data show. The decline coincided with yesterday\u2019s expiry of the options for the October contract, which settle three days before the futures.  \u201cThe fact that the selloff occurred on both exchanges implies that this was no technical glitch, but rather a profit- taking strategy by major market participants that were worried about a price correction,\u201d analysts led byDavid Wech at JBC Energy GmbH, a Vienna-based researcher, said today in a note.  \u201cMarkets in the past have seen much bigger changes that could not be attributed to any single specific factor,\u201d such as Brent\u2019s decline on May 5, 2011, when it dropped $10.39 a barrel, the biggest single-day decline in 20 years, JBC said.
