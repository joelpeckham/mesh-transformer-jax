 "context": "The following article called 'Taxpayers Line Up for Expensive Refund Loans in Shadow of Yankee Stadium' was published on 2011-02-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVirgie Barber climbed over the mounds\nof snow piled on streets around Yankee Stadium on a Friday night\nto file her  tax return  and get an instant refund loan.  \u201cTimes are tough and people need their money right away,\u201d\nsaid Barber, 44, of the Bronx, New York. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that people\nhave to pay to get their money in a day. Every year I say I\u2019m\nnot going to do it.\u201d  Barber joined a queue of people on Jan. 28 entering the  Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc . franchise on Gerard Avenue after\nwork with a W-2 form in hand and hopes of getting a refund-\nanticipation loan from one of the few companies able to offer\nit. The loans, known as RALs, are secured by an individual\u2019s\nexpected  tax refund , with annualized  interest rates  that may run\nas high as 124 percent.  Regulators have cracked down on RALs and the  Internal\nRevenue Service  has said they are marketed to those who may not\nhave cash to pay for help on their returns. Tax preparers and\ntheir bank partners made 8.4 million refund loans in the 2008\nfiling season, costing consumers about $738 million in fees,\naccording to a February 2010  report  by the National Consumer Law\nCenter in  Boston  and Washington-based Consumer Federation of\nAmerica.    Jackson Hewitt , the second-biggest U.S. tax preparer after  H&R Block Inc ., advertises the loans as a way to get money \u201cin\nas little as one day,\u201d according to the Parsippany, New Jersey-\nbased company\u2019s website. The median  household income  in the\nBronx was $35,000, according to the latest  U.S. Census data .  Nationwide Hiring  Barber\u2019s return was prepared by Nyri Arne Jeffries, 33, one\nof about 32,000 workers Jackson Hewitt hired nationwide for this\ntax season. Jeffries, who previously worked in retail, completed\na 10-week tax course plus 2 weeks of training on the firm\u2019s\ncomputer software before starting to prepare returns, she said.  \u201cI like to deal with finances,\u201d said Jeffries, who wants\nto get her bachelor\u2019s degree and run her own consulting business\none day. \u201cTaxes to me are the back office of everything.\u201d  Jackson Hewitt offers the loans through an agreement with\nRepublic Bancorp Inc., based in Louisville,  Kentucky . The bank\napproves the funding. \u201cWe\u2019re just the middleman,\u201d said\nKassandra Davis, 42, who handles compliance for returns from  New\nYork  and New Jersey franchises, in an interview at the Gerard\nAvenue office. About 6,500 returns were processed last year at\nthe company\u2019s three locations near the stadium, said Davis.  Wait for Refunds  Before explaining the terms of the refund loans, preparers\nlike Jeffries are instructed to tell customers that the fastest\nway to get their refund is through the IRS, which typically\ntakes 8 days to 15 days if you use direct deposit, said Davis.  Because electronic filing and direct deposit have reduced\nthe wait for refunds, the IRS will no longer help banks\nunderwrite tax-refund loans by providing them with information\nabout a taxpayer\u2019s debt, the agency  said  in August. H&R Block\nisn\u2019t offering tax-refund loans this year after the Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks,\nblocked  HSBC Holdings Plc  from funding them. H&R Block had a\ncontract with the London-based bank set to expire in 2013.  JPMorgan Chase & Co . exited the refund-loan business in April\n2010.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is \u201ccarefully\nscrutinizing whether RALs are a safe and sound product given the\nabsence of a debt indicator due to the IRS decision,\u201d spokesman  David Barr  said in an e-mail.  To qualify for a $1,561.22 loan at Jackson Hewitt, a\ntaxpayer needs a minimum federal tax refund of $2,000. The\nfinance charge is $61.22 with an estimated annualized percentage\nrate of 124 percent. There\u2019s an additional $49.95 in fees for\nthe bank\u2019s administration and Jackson Hewitt\u2019s transmission,\naccording to the signage in the office.  \u2018Hard Look\u2019  People should \u201ctake a hard look\u201d at the cost of these\nloans before signing up because there are tax preparation\nservices available for free that deliver refunds quickly, said\nMarietta Rodriguez, national director for homeownership and\nlending at  NeighborWorks America , a Washington-based nonprofit\nthat supports a network of community development and affordable\nhousing organizations.  \u201cThis time of year people are always feeling a spending\nhangover from the holidays and people are particularly\nvulnerable to this hard money,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThe cost\nrelated to the loans is very high usually and entities that\noffer them make them very accessible.\u201d  In addition to its storefront franchises, Jackson Hewitt\nalso offers tax preparation services in more than 2,000  Wal-Mart\nStores Inc . locations, according to Philip Sanford, chief\nexecutive officer and president of the tax preparer.  Filing Fees  \u201cFor a significant portion of our customers their tax\nrefund is their largest single financial transaction of the year\nand for a significant portion of our customers they want their\nmoney in as little as a day,\u201d said Sanford in an interview. The\ncompany had no comment on the interest rates or fees for RALs,\nsaid spokesman Michael LaCosta.  The cost for filing the simplest federal and state returns\nwith Jackson Hewitt in the Bronx location ranges from $58 to\n$104, according to signage in the office. Additional charges\napply for more complex returns such as deductions for education\nexpenses, Davis said. The loan fees and tax preparation charges\nare subtracted directly from the refund when the taxpayer opts\nfor a RAL. \u201cThere are no upfront costs,\u201d Davis said. Customers\nmay know if they are approved and pick up their check within a\nday, she said.  Free IRS Filing  The IRS offers free online federal tax preparation for\nworkers with adjusted gross incomes up to $58,000, or about 70\npercent of filers, according to its  website . The software is\noffered by several companies, some of which may also provide\nstate tax return filing for free or for a fee. TurboTax, a tax\nproduct sold by  Mountain View , California-based  Intuit Inc .,\nparticipates in the free file program, for example, and also has\nfree state-tax preparation available for qualified taxpayers in\n21 states, said spokeswoman Ashley Kirkendall.  The IRS is requiring all paid tax preparers to register for\na preparer tax identification number, or PTIN, starting this\nyear,  David Williams , head of the agency\u2019s return preparer\noffice, said in a telephone interview. The requirement is the\nfirst step in a phased-in effort to create minimum standards for\npreparers, Williams said.  Competency Exam  Certain preparers will need to pass a competency exam and\ntake 15 hours of continuing education courses each year,\naccording to Williams. A start date for these requirements has\nnot been set yet, the IRS said.  \u201cTaxpayers are ultimately responsible for the accuracy of\ntheir returns under the law so they need to be careful in\nchoosing a preparer,\u201d Williams said.  Barber opted for a loan, knowing it was an expensive way to\nget her refund because of bills to pay such as her car\nregistration and insurance, she said.  \u201cThe economy is so bad but things are looking up,\u201d Barber\nsaid, rushing out of the Jackson Hewitt office into the winter\nnight with plans to be back the next day to pick up her check.
