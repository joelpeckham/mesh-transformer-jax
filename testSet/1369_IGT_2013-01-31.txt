The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Scientific Games Corp. agreed to buy\n WMS Industries Inc. (WMS)  for $1.5 billion, the biggest deal in\nleisure and recreational products in almost two years, to create\na global supplier of lottery equipment and  slot machines .  The offer of $26 a share is 59 percent higher than WMS\u2019s\nclosing price yesterday. The transaction was approved by both\nboards unanimously, the companies said today in a statement.  With the deal, Scientific Games, which is 38 percent  owned \nby billionaire Ron Perelman, a director since 2003, expands  its\nofferings for casinos. The New York-based supplier of lottery\nsystems and instant tickets plans to share production, software\nand customer services with WMS to save money.  The deal creates \u201ca huge opportunity for revenue synergy\nand to market and sell each others products and to create new\nproducts,\u201d Scientific Games Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer Lorne Weil said today on a conference call. \u201cWe are\nvery complementary.\u201d  Scientific Games  surged  13 percent to $10.06 at 12:24 p.m.\nin  New York . WMS, based in Waukegan,  Illinois , jumped 52 percent\nto $24.86, the biggest intraday day gain since at least 1982.\nCompetitors  International Game Technology (IGT)  and  Bally Technologies\nInc. (BYI)  also advanced, gaining almost 7 percent.  The slot machine industry is recovering from the global\neconomic slump that saw casinos defer purchases of new machines,\nWMS CEO Brian Gamache said in an interview in October. The\ncompany unveiled over 100 new games at the industry\u2019s annual\ntrade show in  Las Vegas  that month, including ones based on the\nmovie \u201cWilly Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\u201d and another\nfeaturing the  rock band  Kiss.  Casino Suppliers  The WMS purchase demonstrates that casino suppliers have\nbeen undervalued by investors,  David Bain , an analyst at Sterne,\nAgee & Leach Inc. wrote in a note today.  The transaction is the largest in leisure and recreational\nproducts since at least February 2011, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Scientific Games is paying about 7 times\nWMS\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization. That compares with the median of about 8.6 times\nfor 26 similar deals, the data show.  The companies generated combined revenue of about $1.6\nbillion and $579 million in earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, according to the statement.  The deal is expected to be completed by the end of this\nyear and produce annual savings of about $90 million, Weil said\non the call.  Rivals\u2019 Multiples  Rivals IGT and Bally trade at multiples of 5.3 and 6.6\ntimes their projected earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, below their historical trading\nranges, Bain said.  IGT is the target of a proxy battle led by investor Jason Ader, who is trying to install three board members at the\nworld\u2019s largest slot machine maker.  Ader said in a statement that today\u2019s merger \u201cdemonstrates\nthe value that smart strategic investors place on the core\ncasino gaming equipment business\u201d and reaffirms his company\u2019s\nthesis that \u201cthe slot machine industry is alive and poised for\ngrowth.\u201d  Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG provided\nfinancial advice to Scientific Games. The two also committed\nfinancing for the transaction alongside UBS AG. Macquarie Group\nLtd. served as exclusive financial adviser to WMS.
