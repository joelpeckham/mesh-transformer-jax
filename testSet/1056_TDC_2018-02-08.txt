The UK's FTSE is down 0.3 percent ahead of the Bank of England policy meeting. Telecoms are also in the spotlight with TDC up 20 percent after the Danish telecoms operator turned down an indicative takeover bid from Australia's Macquarie and three pension funds. Here's your snapshot: (Danilo Masoni) WHAT'S ON THE RADAR FOR THE EUROPEAN OPEN (0748 GMT) European shares\u2019 recovery rally looks set for an abrupt ending on Thursday with futures pointing to losses of 0.7 to 0.9 percent after weaker trading on Wall Street and in Asia. Earnings, which took a back seat earlier this week amid the global market turmoil, are coming in thick and fast with several big European banks and industrial firms reporting. Societe Generale and Commerzbank both reported declining profits, blaming weak markets and restructuring, while Italy's UniCredit swung to a profit in 2017. Oil major Total, whose shares fell sharply this week as crude prices tumbled, reported soaring profit, raising its dividend and planning a share buyback. And as we detailed just now, some surprising M&A news should liven up the insurance sector. (Helen Reid) M&A NEWSFLOW PUTS INSURERS IN FOCUS (0743 GMT) Insurance stocks are definitely on the watchlist with some interesting M&A newsflow that could liven up the session with Swiss Re set to lead the dance after surprise news that Japan's SoftBank is in talks to buy a minority stake in the Swiss reinsurer. \"Yesterday\u2019s announcement is totally surprising,\" says Baader Bank Helvea analyst Daniel Bischof. \"However, given SoftBank\u2019s technology-vision, Swiss Re makes sense as a target given its extraordinary research & development capabilities which distinguish Swiss Re from competition and make the company a knowledge powerhouse,\" he added. Swiss Re shares are seen up 5 percent following the news. The deal is reported to be worth 10 billion or more. Still in the sector, a source-based Bloomberg report said yesterday that Bermuda-based insurer XL Group attracting interest from rivals including Allianz SE of Germany. goo.gl/XHHosw And there are also some earnings updates. Zurich Insurance reported better-than-expected earnings as the insurer dealt with a raft of natural catastrophe losses and a sluggish investment environment.

Results from UK companies including Thomas Cook, TalkTalk, DFS Furniture, and Sophos, are just hitting the wire. M&A activity could also liven up today's session with Swiss Re's shares seen opening up 5 percent after the reinsurer said it was in talks with SoftBank on a potential minority stake. (Helen Reid) EARNINGS, BANK OF ENGLAND IN FOCUS (0644 GMT) Nevertheless there are other events in Europe today which should grab investors' attention, with results still rolling in from big corporate players. Banks are at the forefront today with Societe Generale reporting forecast-beating results despite quarterly profit plunging on tax-related and restructuring costs. Commerzbank also flagged a 51 percent decline in Q4 profit, blaming weak markets and its overhaul. Other notable results include truck maker Volvo, which reported record profit, and Swiss engineering group ABB, which gave a brighter outlook for the year. We'll also be closely watching the Bank of England's rate decision and inflation report - particularly considering the past week's jitters over inflation. SocGen analysts expect the BoE to slightly raise growth and inflation forecasts. \"The MPC will be happy to see that the money market is now taking seriously its message of further tightening,\" they write. \"However the market has brought forward the expected timing of rate increases compared to its view three months ago quite aggressively, and even though we expect the tone of the report to be slightly more hawkish, we think it might not be enough to validate the current Overnight Index Swap curve.\" (Helen Reid)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Teradata Corporation was 40.099998474121094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Teradata Corporation was ",
