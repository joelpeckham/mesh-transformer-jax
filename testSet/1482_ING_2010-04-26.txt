The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrazil\u2019s next government will need\nto be \u201cvery serious\u201d about keeping inflation within its target\nrange so real interest rates can continue to fall, Central Bank\nPresident Henrique Meirelles said.  \n \u201cReal interest rates are on a downward trend,\u201d Meirelles\nsaid at an event today in New York. \u201cIt\u2019s important that in\norder to keep it that way, the next government be very serious\nabout keeping inflation inside the target.\u201d  \n Inflation in the 12 months though mid-April accelerated to\nan 11-month high of 5.22 percent and exceeded the government\u2019s\n4.5 percent target for the third month in a row. All 41\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg expect policy makers meeting\nthis week to raise the benchmark interest rate for the first\ntime since September 2008 to slow inflation.  \n The central bank has kept the overnight rate at a record\nlow 8.75 percent since July to foster economic growth that may\nquicken this year to the fastest pace in more than two decades.\nBrazil lowered borrowing costs to fight the global financial\ncrisis, spurring credit growth and boosting domestic demand.  \n Brazil\u2019s real interest rate, or the difference between the\n8.75 percent benchmark rate and the country\u2019s 5.22 percent\nannual inflation rate, is 3.53 percent. That\u2019s the third highest\namong 53 countries tracked by Bloomberg, behind Latvia and\nCroatia.  \n Meirelles said that inflation and higher interest rates\nwill help cool demand, ensuring that Brazil will grow\nsustainably, with prices under control.  \n Yields Rising  \n Traders are pricing in a 71 basis-point increase on April\n28, according to Bloomberg estimates based on interest rate\nfutures. Given that the central bank raises rates in increments\nof 25 basis points, futures show that most traders expect a 75\nbasis-point increase on April 28.  \n Yields on Brazilian interest rate future contracts rose,\nwith the contract due January 2011 increasing as much as 10\nbasis points to 10.83 percent, the highest since March 2009. The\nyield rose nine basis points to 10.82 percent at 11:58 a.m. New\nYork time. The yield on that contract has gained 0.42 percentage\npoint this month as inflation expectations accelerated.  \n Brazilian policy makers will take \u201cvigorous action\u201d\nagainst inflation to ensure that Latin America\u2019s biggest economy\ndoesn\u2019t overheat, Meirelles said in an interview yesterday in\nWashington, on the sidelines of the International Monetary\nFund\u2019s spring meetings.  \n Brazil\u2019s economy \u201cis heated and there\u2019s a risk of\noverheating, but we certainly won\u2019t allow that to happen given\nthat the central bank is ready to take the necessary measures,\u201d\nMeirelles, 64, said in the interview.  \n 50 or 75 Points  \n Meirelles\u2019 comments \u201csignal that the central bank may\nincrease rates by more than 50 basis points,\u201d Zeina Latif, ING\nBank NV\u2019s chief economist in Sao Paulo, said in a phone\ninterview.  \n The last time the central bank started increasing rates, in\nApril 2008, it surprised 34 of 46 economists by opting for a\nbigger-than-expected increase.  \n The bank said at the time it was frontloading the rate\nincreases in a bid to \u201creduce the scope\u201d of the total\nadjustment. The bank went on to raise the overnight rate four\ntimes from 11.25 percent to 13.75 percent in September 2008.  \n Analysts are split over the size of the interest rate\nincrease they see policy makers implementing at the end of their\ntwo-day meeting this week, the Bloomberg survey of economists\nshows. While 24 economists expect a half-point increase in the\nSelic to 9.25 percent, 16 expect an increase of three quarters\nof a percentage point and one sees a full-point increase.  \n \u2018Brazil\u2019s Challenge\u2019  \n Inflation quickened to 5.2 percent in the 12 months through\nmid-April, and will rise 5.41 percent by year-end, according to\na central bank survey of about 100 analysts taken April 23 and\npublished today. The same weekly survey showed analysts expect\nconsumer prices to increase 5.80 in 2011, exceeding the\ngovernment\u2019s target of 4.5 percent as well.  \n \u201cBrazil\u2019s challenge in the next 12 months is to keep\ninflation in line with targets,\u201d Meirelles said.  \n After slipping into a recession in 2009, Brazil\u2019s $1.8\ntrillion economy may expand this year at the fastest pace in\nmore than two decades, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc,\nwhich is forecasting a 6.4 percent expansion. Morgan Stanley\ntoday raised its forecast for Brazil to grow to 6.8 percent,\nfaster than a previously estimated 5.8 percent.  \n \u2018Imperative\u2019  \n Meirelles, the former head of global banking at FleetBoston\nCorp., said the economy is recovering at the pace policy makers\nhad expected and that the timeline laid out in December for\nphasing out anti-crisis stimulus measures remains adequate.  \n The central bank\u2019s decision to leave the benchmark Selic\nrate unchanged last month surprised 30 of 57 analysts in a\nBloomberg survey who were predicting a 50 basis-point increase.  \n Alexandre Schwartsman, chief economist at Banco Santander\nSA in Sao Paulo and a former central bank board member under\nMeirelles, said that he had \u201cdifficulties\u201d understanding the\ndecision, given that policy makers in their minutes said a\n\u201ctightening cycle is an imperative.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nAndre Soliani Costa in Washington at \n asoliani@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was 7.259284496307373 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was ",
