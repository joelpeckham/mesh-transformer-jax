 "context": "The following article called 'Annaly's New Units Target `Left Out' Mortgage Lenders and Their Securities' was published on 2010-11-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAnnaly Capital Management Inc. \u2019s\nplan to start lending to mortgage bankers will allow it to\nfinance those \u201cleft out\u201d of a market more dominated by the\nbiggest companies than in the past and provide new sources of\nbonds to buy, Chief Executive Officer  Michael Farrell  said.  The company, the largest  real estate investment trust  that\ninvests in mortgage bonds, said in a statement yesterday it had\nformed a new unit, Shannon Funding LLC, that will provide so-\ncalled warehouse loans to home lenders. The New York-based REIT\nis targeting $100 million to $200 million of credit lines next\nquarter and about $1 billion by late 2011, Farrell said today.  Annaly joins mortgage-debt investors and brokers including\nRedwood Trust Inc., BlackRock Inc. and Gleacher & Co. in seeking\nto take advantage of retreats in the home-lending market created\nby a jump in  homeowner defaults . Warehouse lending, a \u201closs-\nleader\u201d during the housing boom, can now be a profitable\nbusiness, a Wunderlich Securities Inc. analyst said. Annaly\nhopes it will also help it acquire securities, Farrell said.  \u201cThe smaller to middle-market mortgage originators have\nbeen left out,\u201d Farrell said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe\ncapital we can provide to them will allow us to develop\nrelationships over time\u201d that may help fill \u201cour huge buy need\nevery month\u201d created by mortgage bonds it holds paying down.  Those securities created by customers probably would\ninitially be government-backed mortgage bonds with specific loan\ncharacteristics such as properties in certain states, he said.\nEventually they may include other residential- and commercial-\nmortgage debt that two other REITs it manages,  Chimera\nInvestment Corp.  and  CreXus Investment Corp. , focus on, he said.  Warehouse Loans  Outstanding warehouse-line commitments, used by mortgage\nbankers to fund new loans and hold the debt until sales,\ndeclined to about $27 billion on June 30 from more than $200\nbillion in 2007, according to data from newsletter  National\nMortgage News  and trade group Mortgage Bankers Association.  Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp. and  JPMorgan Chase\n& Co.  accounted for almost 57 percent of new mortgages in the\nfirst half of this year, according to industry publication\n Inside Mortgage Finance . In 2006, the top three lenders,\nCountrywide Financial Corp., Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual\nInc., accounted for 35.4 percent. Bank of America purchased\nCountrywide and JPMorgan acquired Washington Mutual assets and\nliabilities in 2008.  \u2018Well-Timed\u2019  The new unit is \u201cwell-timed and a welcome addition to the\noptions available to originators,\u201d  Merrill Ross , an analyst at\nWunderlich Securities in Baltimore, wrote today in a report. She\nrates the company\u2019s  shares , which have returned 13.8 percent\nthis year through yesterday assuming reinvested dividends, a\n\u201cbuy.\u201d  \u201cUnder current conditions, the concentration of\ncompetitors and the lack of financing available to smaller\noriginators has created a pricing opportunity that could allow\nShannon to be profitable within a few quarters of operations,\u201d\nshe said.  Shannon may focus on mortgage companies with between $5\nmillion and $10 million of net worth, Farrell said. Earlier this\nyear, Annaly hired former Bank of Ireland Plc executives as part\nof an initiative in which it plans to make corporate loans to\n\u201cmiddle-market\u201d companies, he added.
