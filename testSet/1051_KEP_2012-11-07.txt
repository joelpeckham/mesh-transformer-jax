 "context": "The following article called 'Renetec May Raise 30% of 1 Trillion Won Tidal Project in Equity' was published on 2012-11-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSouth Korea \u2019s  Renetec Co. , managing a\n1 trillion won ($917 million) project to generate power from\ntidal currents, said it will raise as much as 30 percent of\nrequired funds in equity and the rest through  project financing .  \u201cOur equity partners are being asked to get a certain\npercentage of their energy from renewables so there won\u2019t be any\nchallenge to raise 200 billion won to 300 billion won from\nthem,\u201d Chief Executive Officer  Park Jong Seon , 52, said in an\ninterview in Seoul. \u201cFor the debt portion, we\u2019ll start\nfundraising in May 2014\u201d as most funds will be needed starting\n2015 and terms could be better then.  Renetec highlights a push by renewable energy companies to\ntap larger industrial groups for funds. Backers of Renetec\u2019s\nproject include  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP) ;  Hyundai Amco Co. , a\nconstruction unit of Hyundai Motor Group; and the local\ngovernments of Jeollanamdo and Jindo Island.  Globally, sixteen tidal projects of more than 200 megawatts\nare in development using competing technologies, Milo Sjardin,\nthe Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific analysis at Bloomberg\nNew Energy Finance, said in an email.  \u201cLocation is naturally important if you\u2019re talking about\ntidal, but once you have that as well as government support, you\nstill need a good, reliable technology and an experienced\nproject developer that can execute the project well,\u201d he said.  Pilot Turbine  Renetec estimates its 200-megawatt tidal project 420\nkilometers (261 miles) southwest of Seoul will be the world\u2019s\nfirst and biggest of its kind. The park will use tidal currents\nto generate power for as many as 180,000 homes when the second\nphase of installation is completed in 2016.  Seoul-based Renetec set up a venture in 2007 with Voith\nHydro Holding GmbH & Co., the world\u2019s largest water power\ngenerating group, to produce tidal turbines. The Wando island,\nSouth Korea-based venture is set to install a 1-megawatt\nprototype tidal current turbine off the U.K. coast in February\nbefore manufacturing one for the Korean project, Park said.  Renetec, established in 2001, plans to almost double its\nworkforce next year, Park said, adding that an initial public\noffering is planned for  Korea  in 2015. Renetec aims to obtain\nrelated licenses and approvals for the 200-megawatt tidal\nproject by early 2014, Park said.  The company plans to ask the government to consider\noffering incentives for power from tidal projects, said Park,\nowner of a 25 percent stake in Renetec.  South Korea introduced a renewable-energy quota this year\nrequiring that the nation\u2019s 14 generators boost renewable\nsources to 2 percent. The mandatory quota for the proportion of\nelectricity generated by renewables will be increased to 10\npercent in 2022.  \u201cOnce we finish the project, we will go to overseas\nmarkets with that track record,\u201d Park said. \u201cWe are already\ntapping potential locations in  Asia  for tidal parks.\u201d  The  Philippines ,  Malaysia ,  Indonesia ,  Australia  and  New\nZealand  would be the best potential destinations in Asia for\ntidal parks, he said.
