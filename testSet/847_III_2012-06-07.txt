The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRed is always the most important\ncolor in the Royal Academy\u2019s  Summer Exhibition  in  London .  That\u2019s the hue of the spots that traditionally indicate\nsales, which run riot this year for example around a framed\nprint by Tracey Emin, \u201cSmall and Beautiful,\u201d so sweetly\naffordable at 275 pounds ($427), in an edition of 300, that the\ndots almost upstage the actual image of a little bird. Red is\nalso the color of conflict, and that\u2019s at the heart of the\nSummer Exhibition.  This year\u2019s edition, the 244th, is no exception. In a way,\nit\u2019s just like all the 243 other Summer Exhibitions: a visual\njumble, a cacophony in which every single work simultaneously\ntries to shout, \u201cLook at me!\u201d You could say that this is the\nequivalent in art-world terms of a totally unregulated market.  Except that in recent decades there have been attempts to\nimpose some order on this Georgian chaos. Tess Jaray, a Royal\nAcademician and the coordinator for 2012, has made bold efforts\nto stamp curatorial authority on it all. Her first move was to\npaint the first gallery a strong pillar-box red.  This naturally fights with many of the pictures on its\nwalls. The idea is, she writes, partly intended as a homage to\nMatisse\u2019s \u201cThe Red Studio,\u201d partly a bow to John Singer Sargent who once proclaimed that red was the only proper color\nto hang pictures on. Actually, his late Edwardian portraits\nwould look good on red, though a mellower one than this.  Red Tide  In practice, the landscapes hung in tribute to the late\nAdrian Berg RA thrive on these pillar-box walls because they are\nmainly a complimentary blue/green (not for sale). But the\nmemorials to John Hoyland, another RA who died last year,\nstruggle against the red tide surrounding them.  Another counterintuitive move is to take a lot of the\nsmallest works in the exhibition, and put them in the biggest\nroom, while putting just one video work in the usual place for\nthe littlest pictures, the Small Weston Room. The latter is out\nof place in the Summer Exhibition for the simple reason that it\nlasts 25 minutes, and there are 1,473 other items on view.  Meanwhile, it\u2019s definitely survival of the fittest in Room\nIII, where more than 400 little paintings are hung in a wave\nformation that oscillates around the gallery. A few items caught\nmy eye: an abstract by Virginia Verran seemed to pop out despite\nor perhaps because it\u2019s largely a soft gray (3,750 pounds). The\ncompetition to be noticed is ferocious.  Scully Abstract  In general, there are more small pictures this year, and\nfewer big items and star names. What heavy hitters there are\nmake a mark. An abstract by Sean Scully not only dominates Room\nIV, framed in a series of doorways, it commands the whole view\ndown Burlington House.  Several paintings of romantically misty rearing horses by\nthe new president of the RA, Christopher le Brun (33,600 pounds\nto 96,000 pounds), make an impression, as do abstracts by Ian\nMcKeever (gouaches at 9,400 pounds) and the team of Matthew\nCollings and Emma Biggs (18,000 pounds).  Since 1768 the Summer Exhibition has been a battle for\nattention. Famously, Constable once hung a large painting of his\nnext to a small, gray Turner. When he came back later, he found\nTurner had put a single circle of strong color on his canvas,\neffectively pulling the eye away from Constable\u2019s.  It was a small red dot.  The Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition runs through Aug. 12\nat Burlington House, London. Information:\n http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/summerexhibition/ .
