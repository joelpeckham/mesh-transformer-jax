 "context": "The following article called 'Mickelson Says He Has No Health Issues Ahead of PGA Championship' was published on 2012-08-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPhil Mickelson  said his recent slump\ncan be blamed on his golf swing, not an arthritic condition.  \u201cMy game has not been what I would like it to be the past\ntwo months,\u201d Mickelson said in an interview yesterday at the\nOcean Course in Kiawah Island, South Carolina. \u201cFortunately,\nit\u2019s not health related.\u201d  Mickelson tees off at 1:40 p.m. local time tomorrow with\n Padraig Harrington  and  Davis Love III  in the first round of the\nPGA Championship, the last of four annual major golf\ntournaments. Mickelson won the title in 2005, three years before\nHarrington.  Mickelson, 42, suffers from psoriatic arthritis, a joint\ncondition that leads to stiffness and swelling throughout his\nbody. He first revealed the condition before the 2010  PGA\nChampionship  and has been undergoing treatment since.  While Mickelson said his health isn\u2019t currently an issue,\nsome golf observers have questioned his well-being after poor\nperformances on the course.  \u201cPhysically, he just doesn\u2019t look 100 percent,\u201d former\nEuropean Tour player Frank Nobilo, now a Golf Channel analyst,\nsaid on an Aug. 3 media conference call. \u201cHis game isn\u2019t sharp.\nIt doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s been able to put the time in that he\nwould have liked.\u201d  After a victory at Pebble Beach,  California , in February,\nMickelson finished runner-up at the  Northern Trust (NTRS)  Open a week\nlater. He was fourth at the Houston Open and third at April\u2019s\nMasters Tournament, the first major of the year.  \u201cI had a good start to the year,\u201d Mickelson said.  Missed Cuts  The left-hander missed the 36-hole cut in back-to-back\nevents at the U.S. PGA Tour\u2019s Greenbrier Classic and British\nOpen last month, and was 43rd at last week\u2019s  Bridgestone\nInvitational , leading to questions about whether he can add\nanother major title.  \u201cHe\u2019s reluctant to be completely transparent because it\nopens himself up to a lot of different questions that he\nprobably wouldn\u2019t want to answer,\u201d said former PGA Tour player\nBrandel Chamblee, now a Golf Channel analyst. \u201cSo we\u2019re left to\nfill in the blanks.\u201d  Mickelson has an endorsement agreement with  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) \u2019s\nEnbrel, a treatment for psoriatic arthritis.  \u201cI\u2019ve been able to practice hard,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been\nable to work out. I lost weight. I\u2019m in better shape than I have\nbeen in a long time. That hasn\u2019t been the issue.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMike Buteau in Atlanta  at \n mbuteau@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nMichael Sillup at \n msillup@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Northern Trust Corporation was 37.252620697021484 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Northern Trust Corporation was ",
