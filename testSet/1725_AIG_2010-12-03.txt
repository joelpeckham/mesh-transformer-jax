 "context": "The following article called 'Fed's Delay on Release of Meeting Transcripts Will Be Scrutinized by Issa' was published on 2010-12-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe prospective head of the U.S.\nHouse Oversight Committee said he will consider whether the\nfive-year lag time for the release of transcripts of Federal\nReserve meetings should be shortened.  \u201cIf the Fed\u2019s full transcripts can be released sooner,\nthey should be,\u201d said Representative  Darrell Issa , a California\nRepublican who\u2019s set to chair the panel in January, in an\ninterview. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to have some definable negative\neffect on their deliberations or ability to do their job and on\nmarkets, then we have to be cautious.\u201d  Issa\u2019s proposal comes amid rising criticism of the central\nbank by Republicans, who won control of the House in November\nelections.  John Boehner , the presumptive House speaker, and\nthree other Republican leaders have criticized the Fed\u2019s plan,\nannounced a day after the election, to buy $600 billion of\nassets to boost the economy, saying it risked weakening the\ndollar and fueling asset bubbles.  Shortening the time before transcripts are disclosed is the\nfirst specific Fed issue Issa has indicated he will examine\nafter pledging to intensify scrutiny of the central bank. The\nFed in 1995 began its policy of releasing verbatim discussions\nwith the time lag under pressure from  Henry Gonzalez , the\nDemocratic chairman of the House Banking Committee in the early\n1990s.  Issa, now the senior Republican on the oversight panel,\nsaid yesterday that he had discussed the issue in a private\nmeeting with Kansas City Fed President  Thomas Hoenig , who was in\nWashington for a separate meeting with House Republicans.  \u2018Slightly Shorter Time\u2019  \u201cHe didn\u2019t see it as inherently wrong\u201d to shorten the\ndelay, Issa said. \u201cBut he obviously thought that the next day\nwas too soon, five years he was comfortable with and that we\nwould work on whether there was a slightly shorter time.\u201d  Diane Raley , a spokeswoman for Hoenig, said Issa\u2019s\ncharacterization of Hoenig\u2019s position is accurate.  The five-year delay \u201celiminates any opportunity to say\ntheir decision may have been wrong,\u201d Issa said. He cited\ninterest-rate  cuts  in 2002 and 2003 that some critics say fueled\na U.S. housing bubble that led to the financial crisis that\nbegan in 2007.  \u201cIf you assume that those kind of timelines are correct,\nthen it begs the question of, \u2018Is there enough transparency soon\nenough?\u2019\u201d Issa said. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said the\ncentral bank\u2019s monetary policy wasn\u2019t responsible for causing\nthe housing bubble.  Meeting Minutes  Michelle Smith , a spokeswoman for the Fed in Washington,\ndeclined to comment.  The central bank releases minutes of meetings, which take\nplace eight times a year, about three weeks afterward. The\nminutes summarize meetings without giving verbatim quotes or\nidentifying policy makers who make remarks.  The prospect of increased transparency follows this week\u2019s\nrelease by the Fed, under orders from Congress, of documents\nnaming recipients of $3.3 trillion of central bank aid during\nthe financial crisis, along with details including the amounts\nof loans, interest rates and dates. Issa said he wasn\u2019t prepared\nto comment on that issue.  Federal Reserve officials are considering steps of their\nown to increase transparency, possibly including regular press\nconferences by Bernanke. He is the only head of a major central\nbank who doesn\u2019t give media briefings to explain actions and\nprojections.  Minimal Impact  \u201cThe five-year lag is certainly something we can look\nat,\u201d St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  said today in a\ntaping of C-Span television\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d program to air Dec.\n5. \u201cBut I think the feeling has been that you do want to keep\nthose deliberations open and honest and as forthright as\npossible, and then you want to release the information once it\u2019s\nnot likely to have as much impact on financial markets.\u201d  Over the past two years, Issa\u2019s committee has disclosed\ninternal Fed e-mails that he says showed cover-ups of bailout\npayments to creditors of  American International Group Inc.  and\ndetails of Bank of America Corp.\u2019s takeover of Merrill Lynch &\nCo. Fed officials have said they didn\u2019t try to limit public\ndisclosures on Bank of America and that AIG information that was\nrequired to be released was disclosed by the company.  Hearings Possible  Representative  Jim Jordan , the Ohio Republican who is\nlikely to chair a subcommittee under Issa, will \u201chave a lot of\nimpact\u201d on the Fed transparency effort, Issa said. The panel\nmay hold hearings and conduct studies of the issue before\nconsidering any potential legislation, he said.  \u201cI always prefer if good suggestions were taken and they\nprevent legislation or if enabling legislation is agreed to in a\nprocess,\u201d Issa said.  Republicans are taking chairmanships of House committees in\nJanuary after winning control of the chamber in the November\nmidterm elections.
