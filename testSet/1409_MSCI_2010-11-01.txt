The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSamsung Securities Co.  plans to hire\nas many as 20 analysts and sales staff in Taiwan and Singapore\nnext year as the South Korean brokerage pushes to become a\n\u201cregional player,\u201d its chief executive officer said.  \u201cMoney is fast gravitating towards Asia so it\u2019s obvious\nthat we need to focus our capabilities in the region,\u201d  Park Chun Hyeon , 57, who heads the brokerage unit of South Korea\u2019s\nlargest family run conglomerate, said in an interview in Seoul.  Samsung Securities is opening offices in Asia and\nbolstering regional research to take advantage of record inflows\nfor emerging-market equity funds as developing nations\u2019 economic\ngrowth outpaces that of developed countries. Asia\u2019s economy\ncould be as large as those of the United States and European\nUnion combined by 2015, International Monetary Fund Managing\nDirector  Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said on Oct. 18.  Samsung Securities\u2019 hiring plans, together with about 95\nstaff at its Hong Kong unit, will help it achieve the goal of\nbecoming a \u201cregional player\u201d by 2015, said Park. Its Hong Kong\nunit said last month it hired  Viktor Shvets  from Nomura\nInternational Plc. to head its Asia research. Samsung Securities\nmay also recruit analysts who can cover Indian companies before\nit starts operating there in 2012, he said.  The brokerage, affiliated with  Samsung Electronics Co. ,\nAsia\u2019s biggest maker of chips, flat screens and mobile phones,\nexpects its overseas units to derive more than 10 percent of its\ntotal net revenue in 2013, compared with 4 percent currently,\nPark said. The company\u2019s Hong Kong unit is expected to break\neven next year, before turning to profit in 2012, he said.  China Plans  \u201cWe will basically pursue organic growth in the region,\nwhile being open to acquisitions as well,\u201d Park said.  Samsung Securities is in talks with three \u201cmajor\u201d Chinese\nbrokerages for a possible joint venture or stake purchases to\nboost its presence in China, Park said. The company will see\n\u201ctangible results\u201d next year from the talks, he added,\ndeclining to name the potential partners. Samsung Securities\ncurrently has an office in Shanghai.  Park took the helm at the Seoul-based company in June 2008,\nvowing to bolster investment banking operations. He began his\ncareer in 1979 at  Samsung Life Insurance Co. , where he became\nchief investment officer in 2003. Samsung Securities and Samsung\nLife are part of Samsung Group.  Samsung Securities also plans to turn its branch in Tokyo\ninto a locally incorporated unit by 2012 as South Korea\u2019s\npotential upgrade to developed market status at MSCI Inc. is\nlikely to increase Japanese investors\u2019 interest in Korean assets,\naccording to Park. South Korea was kept an emerging market by\nMSCI in June as the index provider skipped the nation for an\nupgrade for a second year.  The MSCI Emerging-Markets Index has gained 13 percent this\nyear, compared with a 4.8 advance for a gauge of developed\nmarkets.  Samsung Securities  rose 3.7 percent to 66,800 won at\nthe 3 p.m. close in Seoul today, the most since Aug. 30. The\nstock has gained 5.7 percent in 2010, compared with a 14 percent\ngain in the benchmark  Kospi  stock index.  -- Editors:  Allen Wan ,  Linus Chua   To contact the reporters on this story:\nSaeromi Shin in Seoul at \n sshin15@bloomberg.net \n Jungmin Hong  in Seoul at \n jhong47@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nLinus Chua at \n lchua@bloomberg.net \nWill McSheehy at \n wmcsheehy@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 33.05778884887695 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
