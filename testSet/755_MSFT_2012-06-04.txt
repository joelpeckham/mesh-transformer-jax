(NKE) , the world\u2019s largest\nsporting-goods maker, will enter the  video-game  business through\na partnership with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  to expand its brand beyond\nshoes and shirts.  Nike+ Kinect Training will be released this  holiday\nshopping season  exclusively on Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360 Kinect,\naccording to Stefan Olander, Nike\u2019s vice president of digital\nsport. The Kinect, a motion-camera add-on for Xbox, will enable\nusers to receive feedback from on-screen personal trainers and\nhave a workout designed for them, he said.  The Beaverton, Oregon-based maker of Air Jordans created\nthe Nike+ brand in 2006 as a way for people to measure their\nworkouts. It also helped Nike increase the time customers spend\nwith the Nike brand and gain a foothold in social media by\noffering users the ability to post results online and compare\nwith friends.  \u201cWe\u2019ve moved from being a product company to a services\nand product company,\u201d Olander said today in an interview.  Nike+ products have included shoe sensors and a wristband\nthat records workouts and movement to applications on digital\ndevices such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhone.  The video game begins by taking players through a series of\nphysical tests, including stretching and push-ups, to make a\nfitness assessment. The program uses that data to create a\npersonalized training regimen. Activity is then recorded and\nanother evaluation is made four weeks later to measure progress,\nmuch as a personal trainer would.  Facebook Integration  Facebook will be integrated into the experience, enabling\npeople to post results to the social network. Users can also\nwork out with a friend by viewing his or her video feed through\nthe Xbox Live network, Olander said.  These features tie into people\u2019s desire to get \u201ccredit for\nwhat they are doing,\u201d Olander said. \u201cIt gives you this\nimmediate feedback\u201d that will help keep you more motivated, he\nsaid.  Olander, who introduced the game today at the Electronic\nEntertainment Expo in  Los Angeles , declined to comment on how\nmuch it will sell for, or where it will be sold.
