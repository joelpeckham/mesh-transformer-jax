The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. regulators plan by 2018 to find\na fuel for most piston-engine private planes to replace the\ngasoline that\u2019s the nation\u2019s largest source of toxic lead\nemissions.  The  Federal Aviation Administration \u2019s move yesterday,\n posted  on its website, marked the first time the agency has\nstated when it wants to approve an unleaded alternative to\nleaded gasoline, which powers most U.S. private aircraft 16\nyears after regulators banned it for cars.  Leaded aviation gasoline was linked in a  study  last year to\nelevated levels of the toxic metal in children living near\ngeneral-aviation airports.  \u201cBoth the FAA and the EPA have known for a long time that\nlead is harmful,\u201d Marcie Keever, legal director for Friends of\nthe Earth, said in a phone interview. \u201cSix more years is just\ntoo long to wait for the public\u2019s health.\u201d  The advocacy group filed suit in March against the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency to force tighter regulation of\nlead in aviation gasoline. Private planes accounted for 56.9\npercent of U.S. lead emissions in 2008, according to the EPA\u2019s\nmost recent data.  The FAA\u2019s statement coincided with the release of a  report \nby an agency advisory committee saying it could take years to\nfully replace leaded fuel.  Because aviation-gasoline sales have been shrinking for\nmore than 10 years and certifying that a new fuel is safe could\nbe expensive, there\u2019s been little economic incentives for oil\nrefiners, engine manufacturers or plane owners to develop new\nfuels, the report concluded.  No Substitute  The effort to test new fuels will cost the FAA an estimated\n$57.5 million over the next 11 years, the committee report said.  There\u2019s no current substitute for 100-octane leaded\n aviation fuel  that would work in all aircraft, the committee\nconcluded.  \u201cThe transition may still be years away, but this report\ncharts a road map that identifies the essential elements that\nneed to be addressed to make this happen in a way that maintains\nsafety and the role government should play in minimizing the\ntotal cost,\u201d Eric Byer, vice president of the  National Air\nTransportation Association , said in an e-mail statement.  The NATA, an Alexandria, Virginia-based trade group,\nrepresents businesses at airports serving privately owned\naircraft, including fuel sellers.  The FAA, in its website statement, said it\u2019s committed to a\n\u201cfiscally responsible action plan.\u201d  The EPA is continuing to gather data on lead emissions near\nairports before determining its next steps, Cathy Milbourn, a\nspokeswoman for the EPA, said in an e-mail.  110 Airports  Some fuel suppliers and a former aircraft-company\nresearcher have disputed statements that there\u2019s no substitute\nfor leaded gas.  Unleaded fuel can work in most existing aircraft, according\nto Cesar Gonzalez, former head of engine and fuel research at\n Textron Inc. (TXT) \u2019s Cessna Aircraft unit. Of the remaining planes,\nmost can be modified to use unleaded fuel at a modest cost,\nGonzalez said in phone interviews.  Government and industry could also do more to promote\nexisting unleaded fuel, Kent Misegades, a fuel distributor in\nCary,  North Carolina , and director of a non-profit group that\nadvocates the alternative gasoline, said in a phone interview.  While most small planes can now fly on high-octane\nautomobile gasoline that contains no ethanol, the fuel is\navailable at only about 110 of 5,100 U.S. airports, Misegades\nsaid in a phone interview.  Lead Emissions  An environmental group, the San Francisco-based Center for\nBiological Diversity, notified the EPA yesterday that it intends\nto sue to force the agency to enforce lead emission standards\nfor states, according to an e-mail  statement .  The EPA will review the center\u2019s notice, Milbourn said.  Under lead emission standards introduced in 2008, the EPA\nrequired states within three years to submit plans for\nimplementing the changes. Thirty-four states and two territories\nhaven\u2019t filed, the group\u2019s release said.
