 "context": "The following article called 'Spain Grazing Junk Status Fuels Contagion Risk: Euro Credit' was published on 2012-06-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSpain \u2019s slide down the credit-rating\nladder has brought the nation within a hair of junk status and\nrisks triggering contagion in  Italy  and beyond should investors\ncompletely shun its bonds.  The yield on Spain\u2019s benchmark 10-year notes was at 6.89\npercent at 2:33 p.m. in  Madrid , after rising to a euro-era\nrecord 6.92 percent yesterday. That came after Moody\u2019s Investors\nService cut its rating three levels to Baa3, one step above\njunk. Investors demanded 5.3 percentage points  more  to hold its\n10-year debt than that of  Germany , with which it shared an AAA\nrating as recently as September 2010.  Moody\u2019s said Spain\u2019s decision to seek as much as 100\nbillion euros ($126 billion) of European funds to shore up its\nbanks increased the risk the country would need a full bailout.\nSpain\u2019s aid request and the credit-rating reduction have\nincreased foreign investor flight, leaving the Treasury\nincreasingly reliant on the soon-to-be rescued domestic banking\nindustry to buy its debt.  \u201cJunk status would be serious and would confirm it is\nlocked out of the  capital markets ,\u201d said  Marc Chandler , head of\nglobal currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  New\nYork . \u201cIt would mean the bank aid turns into a full-fledged aid\npackage, redouble pressure on Italy and France while  Portugal \nwould take another hit.\u201d  Italy\u2019s 10-year bond yield has risen almost 30 basis points\nsince Spain said it would request the bank assistance on June 9.\nThat pushed the premium investors demand to hold Italian debt\nover comparable German bunds to 455 basis points.  Under Scrutiny  Moody\u2019s has kept Spain on review for a possible further\ndowngrade.  Fitch Ratings , which rates Spain two levels above\njunk at BBB, said June 12 that all euro countries were at risk\nof downgrade. Standard and Poor\u2019s has a negative outlook on\nSpain\u2019s BBB+ rating, which is three steps above junk.  Spain\u2019s financing needs are increasing along with its\ncosts. The debt load surged after a  budget surplus  turned into a\nballooning deficit following the end of a 10-year real-estate\nboom. The economy is stuck in its second recession since 2009,\ncomplicating efforts to trim the euro-region\u2019s third-largest\ndeficit by 40 percent in a year.  Spain\u2019s total public debt rose to 72.1 percent of GDP in\nthe first quarter from 68.5 percent at the end of last year, the\nBank of Spain said today. In April, the central government\u2019s\ndeficit was at 2.4 percent of GDP, compared with a full year\ntarget of 3.5 percent, according to the Budget Ministry. It\nsurged from a year ago due to cash transfers to the 17 semi-\nautonomous to help them reorder their finances, it said.  Debt Load  The bank bailout will increase Spain\u2019s debt to about 90\npercent of gross domestic product and threatens to further limit\nits ability to sell borrow, Moody\u2019s said when announcing the\nrating decision. That will make the government more dependent on\nthe same domestic banks that needed the rescue to cover their\nbad real-estate loans.  Treasury data show foreign investors\u2019 share of Spanish\nbonds dropped to 38 percent in April from 52 percent in\nDecember, while domestic lenders\u2019 rose to 30 percent from 16\npercent.  \u201cThis is an unsustainable situation,\u201d Moody\u2019s wrote in\nits June 13 report. \u201cThe government is likely to become\nincreasingly constrained with regard to the terms under which it\nis able to refinance maturing debt.\u201d  Rating Pressure  A junk rating also may put additional pressure on the banks\nby reducing the value of the  government bonds  that Spanish\nlenders use as collateral to access funding from the  European\nCentral Bank .  Bank of Spain data published yesterday showed the lenders\nincreasing dependence on ECB funding, which rose 9 percent in\nMay to a record 288 billion euros. Under ECB rules, governments\nmust maintain a rating equivalent to at least BBB- from one of\nthe four accepted rating agencies.  The recent widening in Spanish corporate bond spreads\npartly reflects growing concerns about a junk rating, said Georg Grodzki, who helps oversee $515 billion at  Legal & General (LGEN) \nInvestment Management in  London .  Telefonica SA (TEF) \u2019s $1.5 billion of\n5.462 percent bonds due in 2021 yield 7.20 percent, or 550 basis\npoints more than comparable maturity Treasury bonds, about 200\nbasis points than at the start of March, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cA junk rating of Spain would be much more significant\nthan those of Portugal and Ireland as billions of corporate\nbonds that would no longer qualify for investment grade funds\nwould be subject to forced selling,\u201d Grodzki said.
