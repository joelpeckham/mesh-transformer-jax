 "context": "The following article called 'Banks Said to Ask for 30-Day Delay on U.A.E. Mortgage Caps' was published on 2013-01-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBanks in the United Arab Emirates\nplan to ask the central bank to delay by 30 days implementing\nnew caps on mortgage lending that were announced at the end of\nlast year, according to three bankers familiar with the plan.  They also plan to speak with the central bank on raising\nthe new loan-to-value lending limits required for both citizens\nand foreigners, they said, asking not to be identified because\nthe discussions are private. Chief executive officers of U.A.E.\nbanks that are part of the Emirates Banks Association met in\nDubai late yesterday to discuss the rules, they said. A\nspokesman for the association could not immediately be reached.  The central bank issued new rules on Dec. 30 that\nrestricted mortgages for expatriates to 50 percent of the value\nof the property for a first home and to 40 percent for the\nsecond. Financial institutions may lend up to 70 percent of\nvalue to U.A.E citizens for the first dwelling and up to 60\npercent for a second. Previously, there were no loan-to-value\nlimits and some lent as much as 90 percent of the value.  The restrictions follow a recovery in  home prices  in parts\nof Dubai and new government plans for projects including a\ndistrict boasting the world\u2019s biggest shopping mall and five\ntheme parks. The plans evoked the debt-fuelled drive to turn\nDubai into a regional tourism and financial hub before property\nprices crashed more than 65 percent during the global recession,\nbringing the emirate to the brink of default in 2009.  \u201cCaps on mortgage loan-to-value ratios shows that\ngovernment authorities are concerned about market stability and\nwant to avoid any rapid increase in real estate prices,\u201d Craig\nPlumb, regional head of research at Chicago-based broker  Jones\nLang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) , said today in an e-mailed report.  Proposed Caps  Most bankers at yesterday\u2019s meeting favored loan-to-value\ncaps ranging from 70 percent to 85 percent, with a higher limit\nfor citizens and lower for foreigners, according to two of the\nbankers. Some favored no loan-to-value limits for the first\nproperty for both citizens and foreigners, they said.  The U.A.E. economy, the Arab world\u2019s second-biggest after\n Saudi Arabia , probably expanded by 4 percent in 2012, while\ngrowth is expected to slow to 3.1 percent this year, according\nto the median forecast of 14 economists compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe U.A.E. comprises seven sheikdoms including  Abu Dhabi  and\nDubai, and foreigners make up over 80 percent of its population.  Total real estate mortgage loans at the U.A.E.\u2019s 51 banks\nwere 162.61 billion dirhams ($44.3 billion) at the end of\nAugust, about 1.1 billion dirhams higher than at the end of\n2011, according to data on the central bank website. In 2008,\nthe last boom year before the credit crisis, mortgages jumped by\n69 billion dirhams, according to central bank data.  Property Boom  Since 2008, \u201cthere is far more emphasis on financed rather\nthan cash purchases\u201d of residential properties, Plumb at Jones\nLang LaSalle said in a phone interview today. \u201cBased on\nprojects in which JLL is involved, purchases requiring mortgages\ncomprise the majority of all potential buyers.\u201d  Dubai first allowed foreigners to own property in 2002,\nwhich sparked a real estate boom attracting investors from\n India ,  Iran ,  Pakistan  and  Russia  eager to profit from rising\nprices. During the financial crisis, hundreds lost their jobs\nand fled the city, defaulting on payments. After the crash,\nlenders and developers focused on investors who plan to live in\nthe homes they purchase rather than speculative buyers.  The economic recovery over the past year helped push\nproperty prices higher in some areas of Dubai. The average sale\nprice of a mid-range villa soared almost 30 percent in the year\nto November, while mid-range apartment prices advanced 16\npercent, according to data compiled by Cluttons LLC in Dubai.  Regulations  Last month\u2019s regulations follow new rules announced in\nApril that required banks to not lend more than 100 percent of\ntheir capital to local governments and the same to state-related\nentities in a bid to reduce concentration risk. The central bank\npostponed the implementation of the rules pending a review.  The U.A.E. follows other countries that have taken steps to\ncool property markets. In October, Singapore capped the loan-to-\nvalue ratio at 60 percent for the first home and 40 percent for\na second.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also last year set a\nmaximum loan-to-value limit of 30 percent for homes with a value\nof more than HK$10 million ($1.3 million) for investors using\ntheir assets and not income to borrow. In June 2011, it set the\nminimum down payment for some mortgages to 40 percent for homes\ncosting more than HK$7 million to help ease price rises.
