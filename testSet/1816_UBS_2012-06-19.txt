 "context": "The following article called 'GDF Suez Quits Europe as Belgium Plans to Shut Reactors: Energy' was published on 2012-06-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEurope is driving its largest power\nand natural-gas utility off the continent.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA is dealing with government caps on prices in\nFrance and Belgium, losing a 1.8 billion-euro ($2.3 billion)\nwind-farm project in France it spent five years preparing, and\nan early shutdown of as many as three atomic reactors in\nBelgium. Chief Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet says he only\nsees expansion coming in faster-growing  Asia  and  Latin America .  The Paris-based company\u2019s shares have dropped 20 percent\nthis year, a decline that\u2019s wiped more than 8 billion euros from\nGDF\u2019s market value and is more than four times the 4.8 percent\nslide in Europe\u2019s benchmark  power utilities index . As Mestrallet\nshifts investment into emerging economies, Belgium, where\nFrance\u2019s former natural-gas monopoly got about 13 percent of\nrevenue last year, may present his biggest headache.  \u201cBelgium is probably the country in Europe where\nregulation is the most hostile,\u201d Per Lekander, a  UBS AG (UBSN) \nutilities analyst, said by telephone. \u201cGDF Suez has given up on\nBelgium and France.\u201d  Belgium\u2019s coalition government led by Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo is preparing to start shutting GDF\u2019s oldest reactors\nwithin three years, lawmakers said. The government has already\ndoubled a tax on nuclear power to 550 million euros a year.  The frustrations of GDF Suez, whose origins date to a Suez\nCanal construction company in the 1850s, are shared by other\nregional utilities, especially those in southern European\ncountries where austerity measures are hitting the economy\nhardest and forcing tax rises. Shares in  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ,  Spain \u2019s\nlargest utility, are down 28 percent this year, while  Italy \u2019s\ntop power producer, Enel SpA, has dropped 27 percent.  GDF rose 1 percent today in Paris, trailing a 1.7 percent\ngain in France\u2019s benchmark CAC index.  International Power  Mestrallet has moved toward  emerging markets  by agreeing to\nbuy the 30 percent of  International Power Plc (IPR)  it didn\u2019t already\nown for $11 billion in April. The full acquisition of\nInternational Power adds hydroelectric projects in  Brazil , gas-\nfired stations in the  Middle East  and coal plants in Asia.  The company, which got 65 percent of its  revenue  from the\nEuropean Union in 2011, may sell assets in Europe after the\nInternational Power deal is complete, Mestrallet said in April.  \u201cWe want to accelerate our growth in rapidly growing\nemerging countries,\u201d Mestrallet said in an interview at the\ntime of the deal. \u201cGrowth in Europe in energy and power\ngeneration will be limited.\u201d  GDF is the dominant power producer in Belgium, which gets\nabout half its electricity from seven reactors operated by GDF\u2019s\nElectrabel unit, a business valued at 25 billion euros ($31.4\nbillion) when Suez SA acquired half of Electrabel shares in\n2005.  New Policy  Belgium \u2019s Energy Minister Melchior Wathelet will unveil a\nnew policy on power production by July 21 that could see the\nclosure of as many as three reactors in 2015, reducing GDF\u2019s\nrevenue in the country.  \u201cThere is a high probability that at least one of the\nreactors will be closed,\u201d said Joseph George, a Belgian\nlawmaker and a member of the same party as the energy minister.\nEither the 962-megawatt Tihange 1 generator in his constituency\non the Meuse River or the twin 433-megawatt reactors at the Doel\nplant near Antwerp will be shut, he said.  \u201cWe will abide by Belgium\u2019s forthcoming decision,\u201d\nPhilippe Pradel, vice-president of nuclear at GDF Suez said at\nan energy conference in Paris. \u201cWe believe prolonging\noperations of the three reactors would be a good economic\nsolution. Nuclear has a place within GDF Suez.\u201d  GDF is reviewing its entire nuclear strategy because of\nuncertainty about Belgian policy and the impact of the Fukushima\ndisaster in  Japan  last year. The outcome will determine whether\nthe company pursues nuclear projects in countries including the\nU.K., U.S., Brazil,  Saudi Arabia  and  Turkey , Mestrallet said in\nApril.  Flip-Flop  Belgium\u2019s stance on atomic energy has flip-flopped over the\npast decade depending on the parties making up the government.\nDi Rupo\u2019s six-party coalition, which took office in December\nafter an 18-month power struggle, pledged a phasing out of\nnuclear power while guaranteeing supply security.  The possibility of a permanent halt of GDF Suez\u2019s reactors\nhighlights wider difficulties for the utility in  Europe ,\nespecially in France and Belgium. Decisions by regulators in the\nneighboring countries have cost 1 billion euros in earnings \nbefore interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, UBS\u2019s \nLekander said. Total Ebitda was 16.5 billion euros last year.  Price Freeze Challenged  The operator of Europe\u2019s biggest natural-gas network is\nwaiting for a government decision over state-set prices in\nFrance, after it successfully challenged a price freeze last\nyear. The company lost out on a tender to build offshore wind\nfarms off the French coast in April.  The Tihange-1 and Doel-1 and -2 reactors, which came into\nservice in 1975, provide about 10 percent of Belgium\u2019s overall\nforecast power-generating capacity in 2014.  Belgium passed a law in 2003, when the anti-nuclear Greens\nwere part of the government, that set a timetable for Belgium\u2019s\natomic-energy exit, with the three oldest reactors scheduled to\nbe halted in 2015 after 40 years of operation and the rest\nbetween 2022 and 2025.  The oldest were given a reprieve in 2009 when a different\ngovernment agreed to extend their operating lives by a decade in\nexchange for Electrabel paying an annual tax of as much as 245\nmillion euros. That accord never gained legal status because of\npolitical instability. Wathelet is expected to outline how long\nthe utility can keep running the reactors and whether new gas-\nfired plants can be built.  Nuclear Pullout  \u201cThe principle of a pullout from nuclear energy as\nforeseen by the law is confirmed,\u201d Aart Geens, energy adviser\nto Wathelet, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat needs to be\nfine-tuned is the timing. We can\u2019t jeopardize the security of\nsupply of our country.\u201d  Fueling debate in Belgium is a report by the energy\ndirectorate on the country\u2019s production capacity through 2017\nwhich warns there may be a shortfall in capacity for peak \ndemand, with the deficit reaching as much as 4,533 megawatts \nthree years later.  \u201cThe findings are alarming,\u201d the lawmaker George said in\nthe interview. \u201cThe 2003 law was naive. We believed someone\nwould just come along and invest in new  power plants . We now\nknow that isn\u2019t going to happen unless there are guarantees of\nprofitability over decades.\u201d  Electrabel has long come under criticism for controlling a\nmajority of Belgium\u2019s power market. This grew stronger after its\nowner Suez SA merged with Gaz de  France  SA in 2008, handing the\nFrench government a 36 percent stake and a golden share.  Gas Freeze  The before-tax annual earnings from the three oldest\nreactors were 150 million euros, Paris-based GDF Suez reported\nin February. The utility last month announced a freeze in gas\nand power prices and a plan to shut some of its thermal plants\nin the country.  \u201cBelgians are preoccupied with the cost of electricity,\u201d\nKarine Lalieux, a lawmaker from the prime minister\u2019s French\nSocialist Party, said in an interview. \u201cThey have the\nimpression that there is some sort of transfer of Electrabel\nprofits to France.\u201d  Like George, Lalieux says the government will likely make\nplans for shutting at least one reactor in 2015 in a bid to\ncompromise between sticking to the phase-out plan and ensuring\nthere aren\u2019t blackouts in the next five years. Some junior\nparties in the coalition and pushing for life extensions.  \u201cIf the government decides to shut the reactors I don\u2019t\nthink there will be much celebrating in Paris,\u201d Kristof Calvo,\na Greens lawmaker in parliament, said by telephone. \u201cExtending\ntheir lives would be a gift from Belgium to Electrabel, which\nhas long been a cash cow for GDF Suez. It\u2019s either Champagne for\nBelgian citizens or for Mestrallet.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nTara Patel in Paris at \n tpatel2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Will Kennedy  at \n wkennedy3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 7.497344017028809 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
