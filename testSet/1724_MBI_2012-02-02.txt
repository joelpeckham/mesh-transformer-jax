 "context": "The following article called 'Super Bowl Lands on Taxpayers\u2019 Backs as Indianapolis Stadium Deal Sours' was published on 2012-02-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWhile Super Bowl fans are riding zip\nlines through downtown Indianapolis this week in the runup to\nthe  National Football League \u2019s championship game, taxpayers are\ndigging deeper in their pockets to pay for the stadium where the\ngame will be played.  The $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium, where the  New York\nGiants  meet the  New England Patriots  on Feb. 5, has prompted\nlocal officials to raise hotel, restaurant and rental car taxes,\nand make other payments on top of about $43 million in\nunexpected financing costs related to their sports and\nconvention facilities.  \u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019re going to have one great fantastic party\nwith an unbelievable advertisement for  Indianapolis (8383MF)  and it isn\u2019t\ngoing to cost taxpayers a dime,\u2019\u201d said Pat Andrews, 60, a\nblogger and community activist who ran unsuccessfully for City\nCouncil last year. \u201cWell, baloney.\u201d  Plans for the 63,000-seat stadium that opened in 2008 as\nthe home of the  Indianapolis Colts  were unveiled almost a decade\nago. Since then, the collapse of the auction-rate  bond market \nhas led officials to restructure what grew to $666.5 million of\npublic debt.  The Capital Improvement Board of Managers of  Marion County (69790MF) ,\nwhich operates the stadium, collects about $120.6 million in\nfees and other payments to cover running it and other venues,\nwhich is more than double the $58 million it would have received\nfrom taxes in place before work on the stadium began, according\nto financial statements.  \u2018Marginal\u2019 Effect  \u201cThe net effect of hosting the NFL Super Bowl is\nmarginal,\u201d said Brian Williams, a local resident and health-\ncare consultant with PwC Consulting. \u201cYou should be very clear\nabout the difference in financial cost and the lack of returns\non the investment.\u201d  The added taxes and fees are on top of $7 million in costs\nto issue the bonds, undisclosed fees to restructure debt and\nannual loans from the state that have totaled $9 million.  After credit markets collapsed in 2008, the Capital\nImprovement Board had to borrow $16.9 million from the state\ntreasurer to end a swap agreement with KeyBank, according to\nminutes from a Jan. 27, 2009, meeting. The board also faced\npaying $26.3 million after it lost debt-insurance policies\nprovided by  Ambac Assurance Corp. (ABKFQ)  and  MBIA Insurance Corp. (MBI) ,\naccording to the minutes.  $250,000 a Year  The Colts, meanwhile, financed two-thirds of their $100\nmillion cost of the stadium through local-government issuers and\nnow pay $250,000 a year to use the stadium -- about two-thirds\nof the  league minimum  salary for rookies.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about that much money, there\u2019s better\nways to spend it,\u201d said Justin Ross, who teaches public finance\nat Indiana University. \u201cSuper Bowls, like Olympics, don\u2019t seem\nto produce much economic benefit and probably have some\nsignificant costs.\u201d  Indianapolis isn\u2019t alone. Scores of public officials from\n Portland  to Puerto Rico bought the same Wall Street pitch:\nAuction-rate bonds -- variable-rate securities with yields that\nreset at weekly or monthly auctions -- would lower municipal-\nfinancing costs by letting them pay short-term rates, and\nderivative agreements known as interest-rate swaps would protect\nthem if markets moved in the wrong direction. The Giants and\nPatriots borrowed for their stadiums with those bonds and got\nstuck with  interest rates  as high as 20 percent.  Exceeding Estimates  As officials in Santa Clara,  California ;  Minnesota ;\nAtlanta; and San Diego debate paying for NFL stadiums, research\nby Judith Grant Long, who teaches urban planning at  Harvard\nUniversity  in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , has shown that costs\noften exceed expectations. Public subsidies for sports venues\ncost taxpayers an average of 40 percent more than the stated\nprice for each of the 99 facilities built through 2001,\naccording to her research.  Dan Huge, the chief financial officer of the Capitol\nImprovement Board, said the organization was successful in\nraising the revenue it needed to continue operating.  \u201cWe did that mostly with taxes on out-of-town guests,\u201d\nHuge said in an interview. \u201cWe were able to keep our balance\nsheets at adequate reserve levels.\u201d  Indiana  increased efforts to attract sports organizations\nand events in 1979 with the creation of the private, not-for-\nprofit Indiana Sports Corp. The home of the Indianapolis 500\nauto race attracted the Pan Am Games in 1987. In 1999, the\n National Collegiate Athletic Association  moved its headquarters\nto the city.  Keeping Colts  At about that time, Indianapolis began seeking a deal to\nkeep the Colts, who had played in the RCA Dome, the league\u2019s\nsmallest venue, since departing Baltimore in 1984. The Colts\u2019\nlease contained an escape clause allowing the club to move as\nsoon as 2006 if revenue didn\u2019t match the league median. A  2002\npoll  by the Indianapolis Star and WTHR-TV found 71 percent of\nresidents disapproved of using tax money for a stadium.  In December 2004, then-Mayor Bart Peterson and owner Jim Irsay announced they\u2019d reached a deal that would keep the Colts\nin Indianapolis for at least 30 more years. The centerpiece of\nthe agreement: The city would build a new stadium downtown as\npart of a renovation of the convention center. That plan\nincluded a venue that cost $600 million, paid for with gambling\nmoney.  Legislators rejected Peterson\u2019s finance plan, and the mayor\nlost control of the project to a state board controlled by the\ngovernor, said Ross, of  Indiana University . Peterson didn\u2019t\nreturn a telephone call seeking comment.  Hotel Tax Raised  The bill  that eventually passed raised the hotel tax in\nMarion County, which encompasses Indianapolis, to 9 percent from\n6 percent, on top of a 6 percent state tax. County rental car\ntaxes doubled to 4 percent. Marion County doubled its food and\nbeverage tax to 2 percent and surrounding counties added a 1\npercent restaurant tax.  John Livengood, president of the  Indiana Restaurant\nAssociation , said the businesses he represents supported the 3\npercentage point hotel tax increase to expand the convention\ncenter and build a stadium. At the last minute, the mayor and\ngovernor also endorsed increasing the 1 percent  restaurant tax \nused to finance the old stadium, and the governor campaigned to\nget surrounding counties to go along.  \u201cWe opposed the new taxes, as we had the first restaurant\ntax, but at that point it was too late to go in another\ndirection,\u201d Livengood said by e-mail. \u201cNo one wanted to lose\nthe Colts.\u201d  \u2018Crown Jewel\u2019  Peterson applauded the legislation in a statement at the\ntime, saying the project would add a combined $2.25 billion to\nIndianapolis\u2019s economy, guarantee decades of hosting college\nbasketball tournament games and make the city eligible to host\nSuper Bowls, \u201cthe crown jewel of the sports world.\u201d  Peterson also said that while the plan included money to\ndesign and build the stadium, the law made no provision for the\ncost of operating and maintaining it.  \u201cUnless rectified by future legislative action, this\nsituation will bankrupt the CIB shortly after the project is\ncompleted,\u201d he said.  To pay for construction of the stadium, the Indiana Finance\nAuthority borrowed about $612 million from 2005 to 2007 using\nauction-rate bonds secured by state appropriations and insured\nby New York-based FGIC Corp. Kendra York, public finance\ndirector for the authority, didn\u2019t respond to a telephone call\nand an e-mail seeking comment on the matter.  Credit Freeze  Credit markets began to freeze up during the sub-prime-\nmortgage market collapse in 2007, before the stadium opened.\nFGIC lost its AAA rating in January 2008 and buyers became less\ninterested in the securities because the lower grade increased\nthe risk that they wouldn\u2019t get paid in the event of a default.\nThe auction-rate market fell apart the next month.  As a result, interest rates on some of the stadium bonds\njumped to 15 percent on Feb. 13, 2008, from 3.4 percent seven\ndays earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The stadium, designed by Dallas-based HKS Inc., opened in\nAugust 2008. It has a peaked roof, gabled north-south down the\nlength of the playing field, that can open and close in nine\nminutes. A 110-foot (34-meter) wide by 88-foot-high window looks\nnorth over downtown.  Five months later, as Peterson had feared, the Capital\nImprovement Board began predicting a 2009 deficit of $25 million\ngrowing to more than $45 million in the next year. That included\na $19.5 million shortfall for the stadium, new bond insurance,\nand the $16.9 million to unwind the unfavorable rate swap.  Cost Cutting  The board began saving money,  cutting  about $3.2 million in\ngrants to groups including the Arts Council of Indianapolis. In\nJuly 2009, state lawmakers approved a plan that closed the\nagency\u2019s budget gap by letting the city raise hotel taxes to 10\npercent from 9 percent and loaning it about $9 million a year.\nThe board\u2019s budget for 2011 restored about $600,000 in arts and\nculture grants.  NFL owners voted in 2008 to hold the 2012 Super Bowl in\nIndianapolis. The  state\u2019s website  describes a potential economic\nimpact of $286 million.  A study  from Ball State University in\nMuncie, Indiana, said the game may be worth $365 million in\neconomic activity, noting that figure didn\u2019t account for local\npublic-sector expenditures.  Those numbers may be three to 10 times higher than the\ngame\u2019s actual value, based on data such as employment, tax\nreceipts and personal income, according to Victor Matheson, an\neconomist at the  College of the Holy Cross  in Worcester,\nMassachusetts. He has studied impact estimates of the game.  Move Decimal  \u201cA rule of thumb economists use is to take whatever the\norganizers tell you and move the decimal point one place to the\nleft,\u201d Matheson said. \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to believe the\nSuper Bowl will make Indianapolis residents happy. But there\u2019s\nno reason to believe it will make them rich.\u201d  Mark Rosentraub, who teaches economics at the  University of\nMichigan , said Indianapolis needed a subsidy to keep the team,\nbecause it\u2019s one of the league\u2019s smallest markets. The project\nwas also the backbone of a downtown redevelopment effort that\nused about $2.5 billion in public investment. It helped\ncompanies including Marriott International Inc., which opened\n the world\u2019s-largest  J.W. Marriott in 2011 as part of a $450\nmillion downtown hotel complex, produce a total of about $8\nbillion in development.  \u201cIt\u2019s a large subsidy,\u201d Rosentraub said. \u201cThe positive\nis if you take a look at downtown Indianapolis, it\u2019s probably\nthe most active downtown in the Midwest and it\u2019s going to look\nspectacular at the Super Bowl.\u201d  Economic Development  For Governor Mitch Daniels, a Republican, the state\u2019s help\nfor the area wasn\u2019t just about the stadium or the Colts,\naccording to  Jane Jankowski , a spokeswoman.  \u201cIt was about the expansion of the Indianapolis Convention\nCenter and the economic development it would bring,\u201d Jankowski\nsaid by e-mail. \u201cSeven counties in central Indiana, which\nreceive the greatest benefits from the project, worked together\nto make an investment in the future of the area and share the\nresponsibility for financing the stadium through a regional food\nand beverage tax. No state tax dollars were used and no tax\ndollars are being collected outside of central Indiana.\u201d  This week, organizers set up an 800-foot zip line over part\nof the downtown, as part of what the city is calling \u201cthe\n Epicenter of Awesome .\u201d Other attractions include a nightly\nlight and pyrotechnics show, free concerts and ice sculptures.  Andrews, the former Indianapolis City Council candidate,\nsaid the money spent on the stadium and game could have been\nused to better effect. She said there\u2019s been insufficient\naccounting of the game\u2019s public costs, such as forgiven taxes,\nor the proceeds from public parking lots turned over to the NFL.  The CIB expects to lose about $800,000 hosting the game,\nafter paying for things like extra workers, maintenance, legal\nservices, utilities and snow removal, according to Huge.  \u201cThe public still hasn\u2019t had full disclosure of what it\u2019s\ngoing to cost,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to come out\nof services. And we don\u2019t have any extra cash lying around.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAaron Kuriloff in  New York  at \n akuriloff@bloomberg.net ;\nDarrell Preston in  Dallas  at \n dpreston@bloomberg.net .
