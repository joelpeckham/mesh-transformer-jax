 "context": "The following article called 'Gold Bets Cut to Five-Year Low as Prices Whipsawed: Commodities' was published on 2013-05-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHedge funds are the least bullish on\ngold in more than five years as speculation about the pace of\nmoney printing by central banks whipsawed prices, driving\nvolatility to a 17-month high.  Money managers cut their net-long  position  by 9 percent to\n35,686 futures and options as of May 21, the lowest since July\n2007, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.\nHoldings of short contracts rose 6.7 percent to a record 79,416.\nNet-bullish  wagers  across 18 U.S.-traded commodities slid 2.1\npercent, as investors became more bearish on coffee and wheat.  Gold\u2019s 60-day historical volatility touched the highest\nsince December 2011 last week and a gauge of price swings for\nthe SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest bullion-backed exchange-traded\nfund, surged 73 percent this year. Bullion see-sawed as Federal\nReserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke testified before Congress on\nMay 22. Two days later, Bank of  Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda\nsaid he\u2019s done enough to spur growth.  \u201cGold has so many drivers that it leads to a lot of\ngetting pushed around by one thing or another,\u201d said Dan Denbow, a fund manager at the $1 billion USAA Precious Metals &\nMinerals Fund in San Antonio. \u201cIt makes it impossible to\ndetermine a direction.\u201d  May Returns  Futures dropped 5.3 percent in May, poised for a second\nmonthly decline. The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Spot Index of 24\ncommodities is little changed while the MSCI All-Country World\nof equities rose 7.1 percent. A Bank of America Corp. Index\nshows Treasuries lost 1.3 percent.  Increasing price swings have made gold the fourth-most\nvolatile commodity in the GSCI index since March 29, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show. Silver topped the ranking for raw\nmaterials tracked by S&P, followed by natural gas and corn.\nInvestors sold 467 metric tons of gold through exchange-traded\nproducts this year, contributing to $45.3 billion of  value  being\nerased from global holdings, as some lost faith in the metal as\na store of wealth.  Futures traded in New York rose 0.5 percent as of 10:45\na.m. after earlier slipping as much as 0.3 percent.  Gold rose as much as 2.6 percent and dropped as much as 1.8\npercent on May 22, the day Bernanke told Congress that raising\ninterest rates or curbing bond buying too soon would endanger\nthe recovery, while also saying the bank may slow its asset\npurchases if there are signs of sustained economic growth.\nKuroda said May 24 the Bank of Japan had announced enough\nmonetary easing and would implement flexible money-market\noperations.  Temporary Volatility  Volatility in gold prices will be temporary and investors\nwill return to buy the metal as a hedge against inflation, said\nNic Johnson, who helps manage $30 billion of commodity assets at\nPacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach,  California .  While  price swings  increased this quarter, gold was the\nthird-least volatile commodity in the past five years. Cattle\nand feeder cattle were the most stable and natural gas and crude\noil had the most variations. Bullion surged 57 percent since the\nend of 2008 as central banks printed money on an unprecedented\nscale to boost growth.  The U.S. Mint sold 209,500 ounces of gold  coins  last month,\nthe most since December 2009. Central banks may buy as much as\n550 tons this year after adding 534.6 tons in 2012, according to\nthe London-based World Gold Council. Twelve analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg expect prices to rise this week, with nine bearish and\neight neutral, the highest proportion of bulls since April 26.  \u2018Diversifying Element\u2019  \u201cGold is a diversifying element to people\u2019s portfolios,\u201d\nJohnson said. \u201cThe liquidation is more institutional in nature,\nso I think investors very much view gold in the same light as\nthey did before. Volatility will decline back to historic\nlevels.\u201d  Money managers pulled $1.57 billion from gold funds in the\nweek ended May 22, according to  Cameron Brandt , the director of\nresearch for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global, which\ntracks money flows. Total outflows from commodity funds were\n$1.89 billion, according to EPFR.  Investor sentiment is \u201cnegative towards gold,\u201d and\nphysical demand has started to slow,  Suki Cooper , a New York-based analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a May 24 report. The\nmetal will get \u201ccrushed\u201d and trade at $1,100 in a year and\nbelow $1,000 in five years as inflation fails to accelerate, Ric Deverell, the head of commodities research at Credit Suisse\nGroup AG, said in  London  on May 16.  Crude Wagers  Bets on a rally for crude oil climbed for a fourth week to\n231,794 futures and options, the highest since March 2012, the\nCFTC data show. Investors are holding a  silver  net-short\nposition of 187 contracts from a net-long holding of 1,413 a\nweek earlier. Bullish platinum wagers fell 17 percent to 19,713,\nthe biggest drop since February.  China \u2019s manufacturing is contracting in May for the first\ntime in seven months. A Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index from HSBC\nHoldings Plc and Markit Economics released May 23 showed a\npreliminary reading of 49.6 for May, below the level of 50\nseparating growth and contraction and missing analyst estimates.  A measure of net-long  positions  across 11 agricultural\nproducts slumped 15 percent to 228,870 contracts, the first drop\nin six weeks.

Farmers will harvest the biggest grain and\nsoybean crops ever this year as U.S. fields recover from last\nseason\u2019s drought that was the worst since the 1930s, the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture estimates.  \u201cI would be underweight the commodities at this point\nuntil we start seeing a pickup in global growth and a self-sustaining recovery here in the U.S.,\u201d Chad Morganlander, a\nFlorham Park, New Jersey-based fund manager at Stifel Nicolaus &\nCo., which oversees about $130 billion. \u201cThe global economy has\nbeen decelerating, and China is struggling.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nTony C.
