 "context": "The following article called 'Florida\u2019s Crist Says He Wants to Reclaim Governor\u2019s Office' was published on 2013-11-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCharlie Crist,  Florida \u2019s former\nRepublican governor who fled the party to become a Democrat,\ntold supporters he wants to reclaim the office next year,\nsetting up a campaign-spending spree that may eclipse the more\nthan $100 million spent in 2010\u2019s record-breaking race.  Crist, 57, said at a rally in  St. Petersburg  today that he\nwants to oust his successor, Republican Governor  Rick Scott ,\nwhose approval rating in Quinnipiac University polls has been\nbelow 50 percent since he was elected in 2010. Crist said he\nwould fight for the middle class, and described Scott as\nbeholden to lobbyists and big businesses.  The former governor\u2019s entry into the race opens the spigot\nof spending for consultants, pollsters and advertising agencies\nfrom both parties.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a bonanza,\u201d said Jay Goldfarb, who\nearned more than $18,000 this year through his Budget Printing\nCenter in Riviera Beach, producing fundraising invitations for\nthe 60-year-old incumbent. \u201cI expect this to continue, very hot\nand heavy, right down to the wire.\u201d  Scott, a former chief executive officer at  HCA Holdings\nInc. (HCA) , has raised more than $18.7 million for next year\u2019s race.\nAs he traveled to Japan on Nov. 2 for a trade mission, his re-election committee spent more than $500,000 on a two-week blitz\nof television ads targeting Crist.  National Barometer  The larger states of  California ,  Texas  and  New York  are\nmore predictably Democratic or Republican. That makes Florida,\nthe fourth-most-populous in the nation, a barometer. Donors from\nacross the U.S. plan to pour resources into its governor\u2019s race,\nto lay the groundwork for the next presidential election.  \u201cFlorida is a microcosm of the nation, and people look at\nFlorida because we have the evolving demographics, and we have\nthe ability to swing the 2016 presidential campaign,\u201d said\nKevin Cate, a Democratic consultant who was the Florida\nspokesman for President  Barack Obama \u2019s 2008 campaign.  Cate, who\u2019s advising Crist, owns a Tallahassee-based firm\nthat provides media consulting and digital advertising. It\u2019s one\nof hundreds of businesses that stand to benefit from a race that\nwill require direct-mail advertising, hotel stays, private\nflight services, flowers, food and more.  Scott listed his net worth at $218 million in 2010 and $83\nmillion in a disclosure report this year. Crist, a lawyer at\nTampa-based law firm Morgan & Morgan, listed his net worth at\nabout $441,500 just before leaving office in January 2011. He\nentered the race Nov. 1 and has yet to file a new disclosure.  \u2018People\u2019s Governor\u2019  Crist told about 200 people gathered in a downtown St.\nPetersburg park today that he would reverse spending cuts in\npublic education, restore  voting rights  for ex-felons and\nrestart a high-speed rail project Scott blocked in 2011. Crist\ndescribed Scott as beholden to his campaign contributors.  \u201cUnder this administration, big business, big\ncontributors, big lobbyists \u2014- they\u2019re the winners,\u201d he said,\nstanding in front of a sign that read \u201cThe People\u2019s Governor.\u201d\n\u201cAs governor, we\u2019re going to have a  tax policy  that puts you,\nthe people, first.\u201d  Melissa Sellers, a spokeswoman for Scott, didn\u2019t\nimmediately return a phone call seeking a response to Crist\u2019s\ncomments.  State Republicans created a website that criticized their\nformer leader as an opportunist.  \u201cThroughout his career,  Charlie Crist  has only been\ninterested in one person -- himself,\u201d said Lenny Curry,\nchairman of the  Republican Party  of Florida, in a statement.\n\u201cWhen things got tough in Florida, he abandoned the state to\npursue the bright lights of  Washington .\u201d  Re-Election Spending  Crist told a Florida Democratic Party conference last month\nthat Scott plans to spend $100 million on his re-election. Scott\nhasn\u2019t publicly said how much the campaign will cost, though he\nhas said he won\u2019t use his own money.  Curry said his party will spend what\u2019s necessary to tell\nvoters about shifts in Crist\u2019s policy positions and an economic\ndecline while he was governor from 2007 to 2011, when the\nstate\u2019s  unemployment rate  more than tripled to 10.9 percent from\n3.5 percent.  Crist led Scott 47 percent to 37 percent in a June poll by\nHamden, Connecticut-based  Quinnipiac University . The  survey  of\n1,176 registered voters had a margin of error of plus or minus\n2.9 percentage points.  Between Crist and Scott, spending may rival California\u2019s\n2010 governor\u2019s race, the most expensive in history, as\nbillionaire Republican  Meg Whitman , former chief executive\nofficer of  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , spent $144 million of her own money in a\nbid that ultimately failed.  Biggest Beneficiary  In Florida\u2019s 2010 governor\u2019s race, the biggest beneficiary\nof spending was Multi Media Services Inc. The media-buying\ncompany in Alexandria,  Virginia , got more than $20 million to\nhelp Scott blanket Florida with television ads.  Top donors like the Florida Chamber of Commerce will spend\nmillions to help Scott and highlight the state\u2019s economic\nrebound, said  Mark Wilson , its president. Unemployment in\nFlorida was down to 7 percent as of August, lower than the\n national rate  of 7.3 percent that month.  \u201cWe\u2019ll invest whatever it takes,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis is\nnot just an election in Florida, this is very much a signal\u201d to\nthe rest of the country.  Phil Cox, executive director of the  Republican Governors\nAssociation , said his group is prepared to match or beat the $10\nmillion it spent in Florida in 2010.  \u2018Real Money\u2019  \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly expensive state with 11 media markets,\nso it\u2019s harder for outside groups to have an appreciable\nimpact,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou have to put\nreal money on the table.\u201d  In addition to protecting Scott, Republicans want to make\nsure Crist doesn\u2019t win as a Democrat. A lifelong Republican who\nfled the party during an unsuccessful 2010 U.S. Senate race,\nCrist embodies a narrative that his former party is trying to\ncombat.  He is releasing a book titled, \u201cThe Party\u2019s Over: How the\nExtreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat,\u201d and\nhas criticized Republicans for calcifying around positions\nunpopular with most Americans, such as calls to cut spending on\n Social Security  and Medicare.  In a speech endorsing Obama at the Democratic National\nConvention last year, Crist said that Republicans are \u201cbeholden\nto the my-way-or-the-highway bullies, indebted to billionaires\nwho bankroll their ads and allergic to the very idea of\ncompromise.\u201d  The state Republican Party, which spent almost $67 million\nduring the 2010 elections, has already put out daily ads and e-mails attacking Crist. One sent last month was titled: \u201cUnfit\nto Govern: Part XVII.\u201d  The Democratic nominee will have help from national groups\nincluding the Democratic Governors Association, said Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Washington-based group.  \u201cWe believe he\u2019s deeply vulnerable,\u201d Kanner said of\nScott. \u201cBecause of that, it\u2019s one of our top-targeted races.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nToluse Olorunnipa in Tallahassee, Florida at \n tolorunnipa@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nStephen Merelman at \n smerelman@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HCA Holdings, Inc. was 45.52505111694336 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HCA Holdings, Inc. was ",
