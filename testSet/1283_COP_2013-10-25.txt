The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Santos Ltd. (STO) ,\ndeveloping separate liquefied natural gas projects in Australia\nat a cost of more than $40 billion, agreed to share pipelines\nand exchange gas to reduce costs and duplication.  The projects in Queensland state will build two pipeline\nconnection points and sign gas-swap agreements, according to a\njoint statement today from Adelaide-based Santos and\nConocoPhillips\u2019s partner, Sydney-based  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG)   ConocoPhillips and Origin are building a A$24.7 billion\n($24 billion) project to liquefy natural gas for shipment to\nAsia, while Santos is developing an $18.5 billion development.\nAustralia, forecast to become the world\u2019s largest supplier of\nLNG with seven projects under construction, is facing rising\ncosts that threaten expansions.  Without the agreement, the projects would need 140\nkilometers (87 miles) of additional pipelines and multiple\nconnection points to send their gas to plants on Curtis Island\nfor processing for export, according to the statement.  Both the  Australia  Pacific LNG project, led by\nConocoPhillips and Origin, and the Gladstone LNG venture,\noperated by Santos, are due to begin exports in 2015. BG Group\nPlc is building a third LNG project in Queensland, and Arrow\nEnergy Ltd., owned by Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PetroChina Co.,\nis considering a fourth development.  Santos and BG\u2019s Australian unit, QGC Pty, reached an\nagreement in July to link pipelines on the Queensland mainland\nand on Curtis Island, where the plants that process coal-seam\ngas into LNG are based. Connecting the pipelines will allow the\ndevelopments to buy, sell and swap gas at those points.
