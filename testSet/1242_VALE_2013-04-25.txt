 "context": "The following article called 'Short Sales Double as Profits Tumble: Corporate Brazil' was published on 2013-04-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nShort sellers in  Brazil , whose\nfavorite targets tumbled five times faster than MSCI Inc.\u2019s\ncountry stock index this year, are boosting bearish wagers to a\nrecord after valuations rose to the highest levels since 2008.  MSCI Brazil (MXBR)  Index shares on loan more than doubled in the\npast 12 months to 5.9 percent of stock available for trading on\nApril 19, the most since Bloomberg began compiling the data in\n2010. Corporate profits fell 36 percent in the period, exceeding\nthe index\u2019s 5.2  percent drop  and sending the price-to-earnings\nratio to a level last reached at the market peak in May 2008.  Bets against companies from  Eletropaulo Metropolitana\nEletricidade de Sao Paulo SA  to PDG Realty SA are growing as\ngovernment intervention, accelerating inflation and falling\ncommodities spurred the biggest earnings drop in  emerging\nmarkets . While stocks are posting the longest rally since\nSeptember and former central bank President Arminio Fraga says\ninvestor pessimism is overdone, forecasters who predicted the\nretreat at Marketfield Asset Management and Deutsche Bank AG say\nlosses will continue as consumer spending wanes and  China \u2019s\neconomic slowdown curbs exports.  \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve put in the ultimate low,\u201d said\n Michael Shaoul , the New York-based chairman of Marketfield Asset\nManagement, whose $8 billion MainStay Marketfield Fund has\noutperformed 95 percent of peers tracked by Bloomberg during the\npast 12 months. His firm started betting on declines in\nBrazilian shares in mid-2011, Shaoul said in an April 24 phone\ninterview.  Prescient Trades  Short sellers have proved prescient this year. Companies in\nthe MSCI Brazil gauge with the highest percentage of shares on\nloan at the end of December dropped an average 19 percent, with\neight out of 10 stocks posting declines, data compiled by\nBloomberg show. That compares with the index\u2019s 4.3 percent\ndecline in local-currency terms and an average gain of 6.8\npercent for the least-shorted shares.  The 69-stock  Ibovespa (IBOV)  gauge is down 9.8 percent this year\nafter gaining 4 percent in the past five days, as commodities\nrebounded and the government announced tax breaks for industries\nincluding petrochemicals. The benchmark rose 0.4 percent to\n55,196.02 at 2:23 p.m. in Sao Paulo today.  Short interest as of April 23 was about 5.5 percent of\nshares available for trading, or float, in the MSCI index, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show. In a short sale, traders sell\nborrowed stock, anticipating the price will drop so they can\nprofit by buying back the shares at a lower price.  Earnings Outlook  The increase in short selling could indicate a lack of\ncertainty about earnings or Brazil\u2019s economic outlook and\npolicies, according to Otavio Vieira, who helps manage 330\nmillion reais ($164 million) as a partner at hedge fund Fides\nAsset Management, which shorts stocks as part of its strategy.  \u201cWe\u2019re probably still going to have some effects of the\nslow growth last year in first-quarter earnings, with some\ncompanies having difficulty meeting their guidance,\u201d he said by\nphone from  Rio de Janeiro .  Equity loans may also be used to implement arbitrage\nstrategies or fulfill an obligation to deliver the securities to\nsettle another transaction, according to the website of\n BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , operator of Brazil\u2019s exchange.  Eletropaulo tumbled 52 percent this year as short interest\n increased  to 28 percent of float, the highest level in the MSCI\nindex, from 23 percent at the end of December.  Interventionist Government  PDG Realty, a Rio de Janeiro-based homebuilder,  retreated \n29 percent as short interest increased to 19 percent of float\nfrom 9.5 percent at the end of 2012. OGX Petroleo & Gas\nParticipacoes SA, the Rio de Janeiro-based oil producer\ncontrolled by billionaire  Eike Batista , dropped 66 percent as\nshort interest rose to 21 percent of float from 11 percent.  Press officials at PDG, OGX and Eletropaulo declined to\ncomment on the short selling.  Short sales have been increasing in part because government\npolicies aimed at reviving the economy are weighing on some of\nBrazil\u2019s biggest industries, according to Eduardo Guardia, the\nchief financial officer at BM&FBovespa.  President  Dilma Rousseff \u2019s administration has intervened to\ncurb utility rates, bank lending margins, mobile-phone fees and\nfuel prices -- reducing earnings prospects for sectors with a\ncombined  weighting  of about 50 percent in the MSCI Brazil index.  Energy, Raw Materials  \u201cThe business environment in Brazil is being questioned,\u201d\nGuardia said in an interview at the Bloomberg office in  Sao\nPaulo  on April 18.  The combination of falling commodities prices and rising\nwage costs is also curbing profits, said Stefan Hofer, an\nemerging market economist at Bank Julius Baer & Co., which\noversees about $215 billion.  MSCI Inc. gauges of Brazilian energy and  raw-materials \ncompanies, including Rio de Janeiro-based  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) \nand  Vale SA (VALE5) , have tumbled at least 16 percent in local currency\nterms in the past 12 months as the S&P GSCI Spot Index of\ncommodities  slid  8.9 percent.  Brazil increased its  minimum wage  by 9 percent effective\nJan. 1, according to a decree signed by Rousseff. The central\nbank raised borrowing costs for the first time since July 2011\non April 17 after annual inflation accelerated to 6.59 percent\nat the end of March, breaching the central bank\u2019s target range.  \u2018Real Problem\u2019  \u201cThe real economy has a real problem with slowing growth\nand relatively high inflation,\u201d John-Paul Smith, the London-\nbased emerging market strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, who has\nhad an underweight rating on Brazil for the past two years, said\nin an April 19 phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to find\nstocks you want to buy.\u201d  The 36 percent drop in MSCI Brazil index earnings during\nthe past 12 months is the biggest among equity gauges in 21\nemerging markets tracked by Bloomberg and compares with a 3\npercent retreat in MSCI Emerging Markets Index profits during\nthe same period.  The Brazil index\u2019s  valuation  has climbed to about 17 times\nreported earnings, matching the level in May 2008 when share\nprices peaked before the global financial crisis. The emerging\nmarkets gauge has a multiple of 12, data compiled by Bloomberg\nshow.  Economists surveyed by Brazil\u2019s central bank have reduced\ntheir estimate for 2013 gross domestic product growth to 3\npercent as of April 19 from an estimated 4.25 percent a year\nago. In China, Brazil\u2019s biggest trading partner, GDP growth\nunexpectedly decelerated to 7.7 percent in the first quarter as\nfactory output weakened.  Fraga\u2019s Optimism  While Brazil\u2019s economy faces challenges, investors have\nprobably turned too bearish, said Fraga, the former central\nbanker and founder of Gavea Investimentos Ltda., with about $7.3\nbillion under management as of March.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is one of those jump out the\nwindow type of situations,\u201d Fraga said at an event organized by\nthe Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce in  New York  on April\n22. He cited voters\u2019 intolerance for a return to high  inflation \nand the country\u2019s growing class of entrepreneurs as reasons to\nbe optimistic.  Analysts are predicting a 24 percent rebound in MSCI Brazil\nindex earnings this year, according to more than 800 estimates\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Based on those projections, the gauge has\na forward price-earnings multiple of 11, in line with the\nemerging market index.  BlackRock\u2019s View  Brazilian stocks \u201care poised to have a better performance\nthis year and that\u2019s what we\u2019re betting on,\u201d Will Landers,\nmanager of the $4.4 billion BlackRock Latin America Fund, said\nin an April 23 interview on Bloomberg Television.  It\u2019s too early to call the bottom in earnings,  Julius\nBaer \u2019s Hofer said in an April 18 phone interview from  Hong Kong .\nThe same analysts predicting a rebound this year had anticipated\n15 percent profit growth a year ago, estimates that missed the\nmark by about 50 percentage points, data compiled by Bloomberg\nshow.  Retail sales in Brazil declined 0.2 percent in February\nfrom a year earlier, the first annual drop since November 2003.  \u201cYou\u2019re in the middle of a period of economic\ndifficulty,\u201d said Marketfield\u2019s Shaoul. \u201cThere\u2019ll be good news\nand bad news, but the balance is going to be bad.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\n Michael Patterson  in Hong Kong at \n mpatterson10@bloomberg.net ;\nJulia Leite in New York at \n jleite3@bloomberg.net ;\nNey Hayashi in Sao Paulo at \n ncruz4@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDavid Papadopoulos at \n papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of VALE S.A. was 10.785147666931152 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of VALE S.A. was ",
