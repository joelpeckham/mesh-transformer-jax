 "context": "The following article called 'Asia Buyout Firms Pay More, Sell Faster as Competition for Deals Increases' was published on 2010-12-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAsia private-equity firms are paying\nmore for assets, selling investments faster and buying more\nliquid public-equity stakes, as competition for deals rises and\ninvestors resist locking up their money for long periods.  Sales within three years of private-equity investments made\nin 2007 surged almost 10-fold compared with those made in 2000,\naccording to the  Asian Venture Capital Journal . Exits after five\nyears from deals done in 2005 slumped 80 percent compared with\nthose made in 2000.  Buyout managers pool money from investors to take over\ncompanies, financing the purchases mostly with debt, with the\nintention of improving performance and selling later at a\nprofit. In Asia, home to the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies,\nprivate-equity managers have been able to flip companies that\ndon\u2019t need the kind of extensive restructuring that is more\ncommon in the U.S. and Europe.  \u201cIn fast-growing countries like India and China,\nentrepreneurs are already too busy dealing with exponential\ngrowth, unlike their counterparts in the U.S., which are relying\nmore on market expansion and cost-cutting to boost profit,\u201d\nsaid Alice Chow, a Hong Kong-based managing director at Squadron\nCapital Management Ltd., which invests in Asia private-equity\nfunds.  \u201cMost of them have a quick-in, quick-out approach and\nwould not think beyond three years,\u201d said  Vincent Chan , chief\nexecutive officer of Spring Capital Asia Ltd., a Hong Kong-based\nprivate-equity firm.  The average premium for private-equity deals announced in\n2010 in the Asia-Pacific region rose to 30 percent from 13\npercent in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In\n2008, the premium was a record 35 percent.  Pipe Deals  To take advantage of Asia\u2019s stock market rally, private-\nequity fund managers in the region have turned to buying\nminority stakes in listed companies, which typically requires\nless due-diligence and provides an easier exit. The  Asia-Pacific\nMSCI Index  jumped almost 50 percent since 2009, compared with a\n31 percent gain by the U.S.  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  The amount of private investment in public equity, known as\nPIPE deals, increased by half to $12.5 billion in 2009 from a\nyear earlier, according to the Asian Venture Capital Journal.\nThere have been $7 billion of PIPE deals this year.  \u201cWe generally don\u2019t like PIPE because if it\u2019s a public\nequity, we could do that ourselves and we could do it cheaper,\u201d\nsaid  Sebastiaan van den Berg , principal of HarbourVest Partners\n(Asia) Ltd. in Hong Kong, which invests in private-equity funds.\nHe was referring to the management fee, usually 2 percent, paid\nto buyout managers on assets.  The industry\u2019s short-term focus may have to change, as\ncompetition increases, including from U.S. buyout firms that are\nsetting up offices in the region to get better access to\ncompanies to buy.  Blackstone, Carlyle  Blackstone Group LP , based in New York, last year was the\nfirst global private-equity firm to open a domestic buyout fund\nin China, followed by Washington-based Carlyle Group and TPG\nCapital of Fort Worth, Texas. A fund registered in China needs\nless regulatory approval for some investments and use of foreign\nexchange, and can more easily scout out deals,  Antony Leung ,\nBlackstone\u2019s chairman for greater China, said in September.  The number of private-equity firms in Asia rose 13 percent\nto 2,604 as of June from the beginning of 2009, according to the\nAsian Venture Capital Journal. The $39 billion raised in the\nperiod was 26 percent less than the sum gathered in 2008.  More Hard Work  \u201cIt\u2019s going to come down to those firms that really know\nhow to select great assets and do more with those assets that\nwill be able to drive differential returns,\u201d  Steven Barnes , a\nBoston-based managing director of private-equity firm Bain\nCapital LLC, told a Hong Kong conference in November. \u201cIt\u2019s\ngoing to take two times the number of operating executives to\nget done what needs to get done in Asia than it does on a\nrelative basis in the U.S. and Europe.\u201d  That could be a disadvantage for Asia buyout firms,\nSquadron\u2019s Chow said.  \u201cThe industry in Asia is relatively small and at its\ninfancy, so the level of talent isn\u2019t as high when compared to\nU.S. and Europe,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is naturally less focus on\noperational value-add.\u201d  Returns are falling as some private-equity shops face\npressure to invest, even in less attractive targets, after\nraising money from investors, said Charles Huh, a managing\ndirector of the private-equity division of Standard Chartered\nPlc\u2019s Standard Chartered Bank.  \u201cFive years ago, there were a number of managers that had\nfantastic returns, triggering more private-equity firms to come\nto the market,\u201d Huh said. \u201cOperational experience is important\nto be able identify the right opportunity in Asia.\u201d  Lunar Capital  That could be good news for  Derek Sulger , who started\nChina-focused  Lunar Capital Management  in 2007. Two years ago,\nSulger couldn\u2019t persuade two global private-equity funds to co-\ninvest $25 million with him in a Chinese tropical-juice maker.\nThe deal, which he started working on at the end of 2007, was\ntoo small and the company needed too much work, they told him.  Now, after readying Beihai BPG Foods for sale, Sulger is\nset to reap 2.5 times the money he and other small funds put\ninto the Guangxi, China-based company, according to filings with\nthe Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  \u201cIt\u2019s so much work, but that\u2019s how you get the exits\ndone,\u201d said Sulger, 38, who was a co-founder more than a decade\nago of  Linktone Ltd. , a Shanghai wireless-entertainment service\nprovider. \u201cThe private-equity community is very overweight with\nbankers and financiers and has very few people with true\noperational experience.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Cathy Chan  in Hong Kong at \n kchan14@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nPhilip Lagerkranser at \n lagerkranser@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 35.52903366088867 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
