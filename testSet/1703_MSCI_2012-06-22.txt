 "context": "The following article called 'Crop Traders Bullish for Ninth Week on U.S. Drought' was published on 2012-06-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSoybean and corn traders are bullish\nfor a ninth week on mounting concern that dry weather will cut\nU.S. crop yields at a time when  hedge funds  are adding to wagers\non higher prices.  Twenty-three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg said they\nexpect soybeans to climb next week and three were bearish. A\nfurther four were neutral. Twenty expect gains in corn, four\npredicted a decline and five were neutral. Speculators raised\nbets on costlier soybeans for the first time in six weeks and\nincreased net-long positions for corn from the lowest level in\nalmost two years in the week ended June 12, U.S. Commodity\nFutures Trading Commission data show.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its estimate for\ncorn and soybean conditions on June 18 after dry weather in the\nMidwest, prompting the biggest two-day rally for corn since\nOctober 2010 and soybeans since October 2011. Areas of Iowa and\n Illinois , the two largest U.S. growers of both crops, have had\nless than half the normal amount of rain in the past 30 days,\nNational Weather Service data show. The USDA expects China to\nimport record amounts of both crops next season.  \u201cThe current dryness in the U.S. Midwest will further\nreduce the crop yields and crop conditions,\u201d said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . \u201cBecause of\nthe earlier planting and speedy crop progress, the need for\nmoisture is quite high.\u201d  Drought Conditions  Soybeans rose 15 percent to $13.8325 a bushel on the\nChicago Board of Trade this year as corn dropped 13 percent to\n$5.6425 a bushel. The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI gauge of 24 raw\nmaterials slipped 13 percent and the MSCI All-Country World\n Index (MXWD)  of equities added 1.6 percent. Treasuries returned 1.8\npercent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Seventy-one percent of the Midwest suffered from\n\u201cabnormally dry\u201d or worse conditions by June 19, up from 60\npercent a week earlier, according to data from the University of\n Nebraska  at Lincoln. As of June 17, crop ratings were the worst\nfor the time of year since 2008, with 63 percent of corn and 56\npercent of soybeans in good or excellent condition, USDA data\nshow. That compares with 70 percent of corn and 68 percent of\nsoybeans receiving the top ratings a year earlier.  Demand for U.S. farm goods is strengthening. China may buy\n61 million metric tons of soybeans and 7 million tons of corn in\nthe 2012-13 season, the most ever, the USDA said June 12. The\nAsian nation is the world\u2019s biggest soybean consumer and second-\nlargest user of corn after the U.S. While  China \u2019s economic\ngrowth will slow to 8.2 percent this year from 9.2 percent in\n2011, that\u2019s still almost four times the anticipated expansion\nin the U.S., the International Monetary Fund estimates.  Crop Plantings  The USDA said in March that farmers planted 95.9 million\nacres of corn, the most since 1937. That reduced the area\navailable for soybeans, with plantings this year falling 1.5\npercent to 73.9 million acres. Stockpiles of the oilseed may\ndrop 19 percent to 175 million bushels by the end of the\nmarketing year on Aug. 31 and slide to a four-year low of 140\nmillion bushels next year, the USDA estimates.  Hedge funds and other money managers increased net-long\nsoybean positions by 19 percent in the week ended June 12, CFTC\n data  show. The 4.1 percent advance in corn wagers was from the\nlowest level since late June 2010.  Declining energy prices may curb demand for crops used to\nmake biofuels. The USDA estimates that about 5 billion bushels\nof the U.S. corn crop will be used to make ethanol in 2012-13,\nclose to the record 5.05 billion estimated for the 2011-12\nseason.  Energy Slumps  Crude oil slid to an eight-month low in New York today and\nU.S. ethanol production tumbled 2.2 percent last week, the\nEnergy Department said June 20. Ethanol producers are losing\nabout 10 cents on every gallon, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg.  Concern about  Europe \u2019s debt crisis and its impact on the\nglobal economy may curb demand for all commodities. The S&P GSCI\ngauge slid 22 percent from its closing high in February\nyesterday, entering a  bear market .  The  Federal Reserve  cut its forecast for 2012 U.S. growth\non June 20 to 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent, from an April forecast\nof 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent. The central bank also extended\nOperation Twist, an economic stimulus plan to buy longer-\nmaturing debt, while refraining from additional purchases.  The USDA\u2019s forecast of record corn yields of 166 bushels an\nacre is \u201cfar too optimistic,\u201d and the agency may need to cut\nits outlook for the harvest, currently pegged at a record 14.79\nbillion bushels, Commerzbank\u2019s Fritsch said. Morgan Stanley\nrecommended buying corn on June 19 and Societe Generale SA said\nthat day that corn and soy face \u201cupside price risks.\u201d  Sugar Prices  In other commodities, eight of 14 traders and analysts\nsurveyed by Bloomberg expect raw sugar to advance next week and\nsix were bearish. The commodity slid 14 percent this year to\n20.04 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Twelve people surveyed said copper will rise next week and\n11 predicted a drop, while nine were neutral. The metal for\ndelivery in three months, the London Metal Exchange\u2019s benchmark\ncontract, slumped 3.8 percent to $7,310 a ton this year.  Eleven of 25 traders and analysts surveyed said gold would\nclimb next week, 10 said prices would retreat and four predicted\nlittle change. Futures on the Comex exchange in New York are\nlittle changed since the start of January at $1,564.30 an ounce,\nafter 11 years of gains. Prices reached a record $1,923.70 in\nSeptember.  \u201cImplementation of the mildest monetary policy easing\nmeasurements as well as indications about U.S. growth risks due\nto the European crisis does certainly not favor cyclical\ncommodities,\u201d said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital\nManagement in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . \u201cAt these suppressed\nprices, a supply response in some metals can be expected from\nhigh-cost producers and this should support prices.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nWhitney McFerron in London at \n wmcferron1@bloomberg.net ;\nNicholas Larkin in London at \n nlarkin1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nClaudia Carpenter at \n ccarpenter2@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 29.507640838623047 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
