 "context": "The following article called 'Whitworth Said to Have Pressed Abercrombie for Spending Cuts' was published on 2012-09-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nActivist investor Ralph Whitworth\nhas pressed  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF)  to cut back store openings\noverseas and spending, prompting the teen retailer to hire\n Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to advise on talks with him, said a\nperson with knowledge of the matter.  Whitworth has told the company it could be worth $50 a\nshare if spending came in line with its rivals, said this\nperson, who asked not to be named because the talks are private.\nWhitworth\u2019s Relational Investors LLC owned 3.8 percent of\nAbercrombie\u2019s shares as of June 30, according to  data  compiled\nby Bloomberg.  The two sides have met a couple times and Abercrombie has\nasked Whitworth for another meeting, said this person. In\nresponse to Whitworth\u2019s complaints, Abercrombie has slowed the\nbuilding of new stores in Ireland and other countries, the\nperson said. The investor isn\u2019t pressing the retailer to shop\nitself around to private-equity firms or other retailers, though\nhe could do so later, said this person.  An official for Relational declined to comment. Joseph Teklits, a spokesman for Abercrombie who works for ICR Inc.,\ndeclined to comment.  CNBC reported earlier that Abercrombie hired Goldman Sachs\namid pressure from Whitworth, 56. Abercrombie  climbed  5.4\npercent to $37.92 at the close in  New York  yesterday, the\nbiggest gain since Aug. 15. The  New Albany , Ohio-based company\u2019s\nshares have  lost  22 percent this year.  Relational\u2019s Tactics  Relational typically tries to engage the management of\ncompanies it invests in and may start a proxy fight if it is\nrebuffed, John Kernan, an analyst at Cowen & Co., said in May,\nafter the firm disclosed a 2.5 percent stake in Abercrombie.  \u201cAbercrombie\u2019s depressed valuation and very low levels of\nprofitability in their domestic business is probably attracting\nactivist investors, as well as what we see as some low-hanging\nfruit in improving the inventory management in the domestic\nbusiness,\u201d Kernan said in a telephone interview yesterday. An\nactivist \u201ccould accelerate some well-needed changes in a\nstrategic direction.\u201d  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to\ncomment.  Abercrombie\u2019s U.S. revenue has  slipped  2.5 percent this\nyear, and the retailer said in August it is bracing for overall\nsame-store sales to decline 10 percent in the second half. The\ncompany is run by 68-year-old Chief Executive Officer Mike Jeffries, who reinvented the company as a teen retailer in 1992.  Executive Pay  Whitworth has complained about the CEO\u2019s compensation,\nsaying it is excessive given the under-performance of the shares\nover the past few years, said the person familiar with the\nsituation.  Jeffries, referred to as Abercrombie\u2019s \u201cbrand visionary\nand chief creative talent\u201d in a May regulatory  filing , had a\nsalary of about $4.9 million last year, excluding the value of\ncertain  stock options , according to the filing.  Including those awards, triggered if the company\u2019s share\nprice reached a certain level, the annual payout would be valued\nat about $48 million, the filing shows. Jeffries\u2019s personal use\nof the company\u2019s aircraft was capped at $200,000 a year as part\nof an agreement entered on April 12, 2010, the proxy shows.\nJeffries was given a lump-sum cash payment of $4 million for the\nconcession.  Whitworth has also told Abercrombie that its selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses are higher than rivals, the\nperson said, without providing specifics.  Abercrombie traded at an 8.9 percent  discount  to the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Retailing Index on a price-to-earnings\nbasis as of Sept. 11, down from more than double the index\u2019s\nvaluation in April 2010.
