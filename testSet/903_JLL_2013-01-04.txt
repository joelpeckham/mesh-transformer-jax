 "context": "The following article called 'Australia Home Prices to Rise on Rate Cuts: Mortgages' was published on 2013-01-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia \u2019s flagging property market\nis poised to get a boost from record low interest rates and a\nhousing shortage that could boost prices by as much as 10\npercent this year.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia has cut the cash rate by 1.75\npercentage points since November 2011 to match a 50-year low,\nwhich has helped reduce standard  variable  mortgage costs to 6.65\npercent in November, the lowest in almost two years, central\nbank data show. Traders are betting on a 50 percent chance the\ncentral bank will drop the rate a quarter point to 2.75 percent\nby March, interest-rate swap prices compiled by Bloomberg show.  While lower borrowing costs failed to stimulate demand in\n2012, additional rate cuts and a constrained supply of homes\nwill draw buyers back to the market, said Janu Chan, a Sydney-\nbased economist at St. George Bank Ltd. A decline in  home prices \nis already showing signs of moderating, with a 0.4 percent\ndecline in 2012 after a 3.6 percent drop in 2011, according to\ndata from Brisbane-based researcher RP Data.  \u201cThe two most recent rate cuts, and all the successive\nones, should continue to feed through to the economy and have an\nimpact, particularly on housing,\u201d Chan said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cThere\u2019s also the supply side -- there\u2019s been a long\nperiod of underbuilding in various areas.\u201d  Chan predicts home prices could rise by 5 percent to 10\npercent on average in Australia\u2019s biggest cities, including\nSydney,  Melbourne  and Perth in 2013. Her estimate is higher than\nthose of analysts from  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group\nLtd. (ANZ)  and  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , who predict average\ngains of between 3.5 percent and 5 percent in the cities.  Slowing Growth  The median price for homes and apartments across the eight\nbiggest cities was A$483,000 ($504,397) as of Dec. 31, according\nto RP Data. Sydney\u2019s was the highest at A$580,246, Melbourne\u2019s\nmedian price was A$500,000 and Perth\u2019s was A$479,000.  House price growth started to slow in 2010 after rising\nevery year but one in at least 23 years, according to government\ndata. Prices  fell  4.1 percent in 2008, before climbing 14\npercent again the following year, the data shows.  New homes under construction fell for the third straight\nyear in the 12 months to June 30, statistics bureau data showed.  Approvals to build  homes slipped for a second straight year\nto 145,515 units in the year to Oct. 31, compared with 160,760\ntwo years earlier, according to government figures.  Building Recovery  Australia\u2019s building industry, which has been shrinking for\n30 months, is showing signs of recovery, a private construction\nperformance index showed. The index rose to 37 in November from\n35.8 percent in October, revealing a slower pace of contraction,\naccording to the most recent index figures. The  S&P/ASX 200 Real\nEstate Index (AS51REAL)  jumped 25 percent last year, compared with about 15\npercent for the benchmark index.  Construction also is picking up, underscoring a turnaround.\nResidential work done rose 1.5 percent in the September quarter\nfrom the lowest level since March 2010 in the previous three\nmonths, data from the statistics bureau show. Queensland, New\nSouth  Wales  and South Australia state governments are trying to\nboth stimulate building and boost demand for homes by offering\nA$15,000 to first-time home buyers purchasing a  newly built\nhome , according to state government announcements made in 2012.  Construction Boost  They join the Reserve Bank in trying to stoke industries\nsuch as construction as commodity prices ease and the nation\u2019s\nmining boom looks set to peak this year.  The measures contrast with moves by governments across  Asia \nto contain booming housing markets. Singapore home sales are\nexpected to fall as much as 27 percent, according to Chicago-\nbased broker  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) , after six rounds of\nhousing curbs by a government trying to control prices that\nsoared to a record in 2012.  Hong Kong \u2019s monetary authority has\nwarned about an overheated property market and a \u201cdisconnect\nbetween property prices and economic fundamentals\u201d after prices\ndoubled in the past four years.  An increase in home building will help keep a lid on\nAustralian prices and avoid a repeat of the surges following the\nRBA\u2019s last easing cycle, said  Savanth Sebastian , an economist in\nSydney at a unit of Commonwealth Bank who forecasts a 5 percent\naverage increase across the country in 2013.  Previous Growth  Despite declines in  mortgage rates , \u201cthe housing market\nhas still been unable to record growth in values over the\nyear,\u201d RP Data senior research analyst Cameron Kusher said in\nan e-mailed release this week. \u201cIt is clear that the previous\nstrong value growth conditions to which many home owners have\nbecome accustomed of recent years are well and truly behind\nus.\u201d  Kusher forecasts 2013 home price increases between\ninflation and wage growth. That would equate to price growth\nbetween 2 percent and 3.75 percent, based on government and RBA\nforecasts.  Prices in Australia\u2019s five biggest cities have risen about\n0.5 percent this month, led by Sydney, according to RP Data\u2019s\n daily home price  index.  The rate cuts so far have also had limited impact on other\nparts of the economy. The Australian services industry shrank\nfor the 11th month in December, and manufacturing contracted for\nthe 10th month, data released by the Australian Industry Group\nthis week showed. Consumer sentiment slumped in December by the\nmost in nine months, and  business confidence  plunged in November\nto the lowest level since 2009, private surveys last month\nshowed.  Prior Surge  In contrast, when the central bank cut its  benchmark rate \nto 3 percent in April 2009 from 7.25 percent in September 2008,\n house prices  responded. They surged 21 percent in the 15 months\nto June 2010, according to government data, boosted also by\nincreased handouts of as much as A$21,000 to first-time buyers\nof both new and existing properties.  Lending and prices also took off after the overnight cash\nrate was lowered to 4.25 percent in December 2001 from 6.25\npercent in February that year. House prices almost doubled in\nthe following decade as households\u2019 debt-to-disposable income\nratio jumped to a high of 156.3 percent in September 2006 from\n97.7 percent in March 2001, according to central bank data. That\nratio was at 148 percent in the September quarter.  \u201cForward-looking indicators of residential construction,\nincluding building approvals, continued to point to a modest\nrecovery in that sector in the period ahead,\u201d the RBA said in\n minutes  of its Dec. 4 meeting. \u201cThis was likely to be supported\nby the pickup in dwelling prices, sales activity and rental\nyields over recent months.\u201d  Improving Returns  Total gross returns on houses and apartments rose to 4\npercent as of Dec. 31 across Australia\u2019s eight biggest cities,\ncompared with minus 1.2 percent six months earlier, figures from\nRP Data show. At the same time, rental yields remained steady at\n4.2 percent for houses and 4.9 percent for apartments, according\nto RP Data.  Australia had 494 suburbs in November where it was more\nexpensive to rent than to buy a house or apartment, up from 388\nin October, RP Data said.  Rising rental yields are drawing more investors to\npurchase. Investors accounted for A$7.7 billion of  home loans  as\nof Oct. 31, a 15 percent jump from two months earlier, while\nloans to owner occupiers rose 1 percent to A$9.94 billion in the\nsame period, statistics bureau figures show.  Housing finance approvals  for owner occupied and investment\nproperties rose 3.8 percent in the 12 months to Oct. 31, after\nfalling 2.8 percent in the same period a year earlier, according\nto statistics bureau figures.  Market Turning  \u201cHousing finance has seen some steady growth and a lot of\nother indicators of housing market confidence have started to\nturn,\u201d David Cannington, Melbourne-based economist at ANZ Bank,\nsaid. \u201cWe\u2019ll most likely see 100 basis points of interest rate\ncuts in 2013 and that\u2019ll go a long way toward improving housing\naffordability.\u201d  Cannington forecasts prices across capital cities will be\nabout 3.5 percent higher than current levels by the end of 2013.  Still, even as mortgage approvals rise, the pace of growth\nremains sluggish. Annual  growth in mortgages  to owner occupiers\ndeclined to 4.2 percent as of Nov. 30, compared with 9.2 percent\nthree years earlier, according to RBA figures.  Home-loan growth remains at the slowest annual pace since\nrecords began in 1977 as concern about the growth of the global\neconomy and declining commodity prices kept potential home\nbuyers on the sidelines.  The RBA\u2019s rate cuts are helping boost affordability and\nreduce the number of Australian home owners missing payments on\ntheir mortgages,  Fitch Ratings  said in a Dec. 24 report. The\nproportion of mortgage payments more than 30 days late dropped\nto 1.36 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 from 1.54\npercent in the previous quarter, it said.  Mortgage Payments  \u201cFitch expects the  Reserve Bank of Australia  rate cuts in\nOctober and December 2012 to provide relief to borrowers,\nimproving affordability for existing borrowers,\u201d Hai Duong Le,\na Sydney-based analyst at Fitch, said in the report. \u201cThe\nagency expects this to be reflected\u201d in mortgage performance in\nthe following two quarters, he said.  About half of Australian borrowers are ahead of schedule on\ntheir mortgages, with prepayments equal to more than 10 percent\nof outstanding home loans, or 1.5 years of repayments, the RBA\nsaid in its  Financial Stability Review  in September.  \u201cIt\u2019s still early days but you could say the worst for the\nhousing sector is behind us and it\u2019s a steady crawl upwards\nnow,\u201d said CBA\u2019s Sebastian. \u201cIt\u2019s more about creating\naffordable homes than going out and seeing a price surge. So we\nexpect modest growth, rather than extravagant growth.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nNichola Saminather in Sydney at \n nsaminather1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAndreea Papuc at \n apapuc1@bloomberg.net ;\nRob Urban at \n robprag@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated was 83.17882537841797 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated was ",
