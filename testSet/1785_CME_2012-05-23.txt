 "context": "The following article called 'Ford Reclaims \u2018Heritage\u2019 With Investment-Grade Rating' was published on 2012-05-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFord Motor Co. (F)  was raised to\ninvestment grade by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, enabling\nExecutive Chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of the founder, to\nreclaim the blue oval logo he put up as collateral for a loan.  \u201cWhen we pledged the blue oval it was enormously emotional\nfor me personally and for my family, because we weren\u2019t just\npledging an asset, we were pledging our heritage,\u201d Ford told\nreporters yesterday on a conference call. \u201cTo get that back\nfeels wonderful and this is one of the best days I can\nremember.\u201d  Moody\u2019s boosted Ford\u2019s senior unsecured ratings two levels\nto Baa3 from Ba2 and raised its finance arm, Ford Motor Credit,\nto Baa3 from Ba1. Moody\u2019s followed  Fitch Ratings  in assigning an\ninvestment-grade status. With two such ratings, Ford regains\ncontrol of the logo and other assets pledged as collateral to\nobtain a $23.4 billion loan to keep the business going in 2006.  When the upgrade came,  Bill Ford  said he announced it to\nemployees on the public-address system normally used for fire\ndrills in Ford\u2019s Dearborn, Michigan, headquarters. Moody\u2019s had\nranked the second-largest U.S. automaker\u2019s debt as junk since\nAugust 2005. Fitch returned Ford to investment grade last month\nafter assigning it junk status in December 2005.  \u201cThe upgrade of Ford recognizes the strength of the\ncompany\u2019s position in  North America , its robust liquidity\nposition, and our expectation that the company will continue to\nembrace sound operating and financial disciplines,\u201d Moody\u2019s\nsaid in a statement. \u201cWe believe that these strengths will\nenable Ford to maintain an investment-grade profile in the face\nof the sector\u2019s ongoing cyclicality and weakness in the European\nmarket.\u201d  Mulally\u2019s \u2018Milestone\u2019  Moody\u2019s said the  outlook  for Ford and Ford Credit is\nstable.  For Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally , achieving\ninvestment grade removes a burden he inherited when he assumed\nthe job in September 2006. While Mulally, 66, called the rating\na \u201cmilestone,\u201d he didn\u2019t reveal a timetable for retirement.  \u201cThis is way up there on the highlight film, for sure,\u201d\nMulally told reporters yesterday. \u201cBut it changes none of my\nplans to continue to serve this great corporation.\u201d  Ford\u2019s 6.7 year journey from junk to investment grade is\nthe second longest among companies in the  Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 \nsince 2000, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Only\n Southwestern Energy Co. (SWN) , which fell to speculative grade July 8,\n2002, and returned to investment grade Feb. 22, spent longer\nwith non-investment grade ratings.  Emotional Value  The upgrade will lower Ford\u2019s borrowing costs and its bonds\nwill now be more widely traded, said Bob Shanks, Ford\u2019s chief\nfinancial officer.  \u201cOperationally, it doesn\u2019t have too much effect,\u201d Shanks\nsaid on the call. \u201cWe had pledged the assets, but it hadn\u2019t\naffected our operating flexibility to any significant degree.\u201d  The greatest impact is emotional, Bill Ford said. The\nautomaker pledged all of its major assets, including factories\nand its headquarters, as collateral for the 2006 loans, helping\nthe company avoid the 2009 bankruptcies and bailouts that befell\nthe predecessors of  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Chrysler Group LLC.  Moody\u2019s yesterday reiterated its Ba1 rating on GM, one\nlevel below investment grade, and a positive outlook.  Ford has repaid more than $21 billion of the loans, Mulally\nsaid in an April 27 interview on Bloomberg Television.  \u201cWhen we had to hock the blue oval, that was a very tough\nthing,\u201d Bill Ford, 55, said in a May 10 interview. \u201cI will\nnever forget signing those papers. My heart stopped for a\nmoment. It will start beating again when we get it back.\u201d  Out of Hock  Getting the logo out of hock will signify that Ford\u2019s\ncomeback is complete,  Lewis Booth , Ford\u2019s former chief financial\nofficer, said in a Feb. 28 interview with reporters before his\nApril 1 retirement.  \u201cThe psychological impact will be enormous,\u201d Booth said\nof reclaiming the company\u2019s logo. \u201cWherever I am in the world\nthat day, I shall be celebrating.\u201d  Booth, at his retirement home in  Florida , said through a\nspokesman yesterday: \u201cWe\u2019re with friends in Naples, about to\nopen a bottle of champagne. The Ford oval is back where it\nbelongs, shining brightly.\u201d  After speaking to reporters, Bill Ford gathered employees\non the front lawn of Ford\u2019s headquarters, where they formed\nthemselves into the shape of the blue oval logo for a photo.  \u2018Positive Surprise\u2019  \u201cThe timing is somewhat earlier than expected and thus a\npositive surprise,\u201d  Itay Michaeli , a New York-based analyst\nwith Citigroup Inc. who rates Ford a buy, said in a note to\ninvestors. \u201cThat an auto company can be upgraded to investment\ngrade in today\u2019s choppy macro backdrop only supports our view\nthat \u2018new auto\u2019 fundamentals have indeed been established since\nthe 2008-09 downturn.\u201d  Moody\u2019s said Ford\u2019s North American \u201cbreak-even level,\u201d\nwhere it can begin making money after covering its costs, has\nfallen 45 percent to 1.8 million vehicles today from 3.4 million\nin 2009. Shanks said Ford can now make money when industrywide\n sales  in the U.S. fall as low as 10 million vehicles. The pace\nof U.S. auto sales in the year\u2019s first quarter was 14.3 million.  \u201cThe key factor in our considering an investment-grade\nrating for Ford was whether or not the company would be able to\nsustain its strong performance,\u201d  Bruce Clark , Moody\u2019s senior\nvice president, said in a statement. \u201cWe concluded that the\nimprovements Ford has made are likely to be lasting.\u201d  Fitch, in its April statement, said its upgrade reflected\n\u201cimproved financial performance,  balance-sheet  repair, and\nproduct-portfolio improvement that have taken place over the\npast several years.\u201d  More Work  Ford still has more work to do to improve its balance\nsheet, such as reducing automotive debt to $10 billion by mid-\ndecade from $13.7 billion on March 31, Shanks said.  \u201cWe still have nearly $4 billion to go,\u201d Shanks said\ntoday on \u201cThe Hays Advantage\u201d on Bloomberg Radio. \u201cI don\u2019t\nthink we\u2019ll get there in a linear way, but we\u2019re certainly on\nour way.\u201d  The automaker has had 12 consecutive profitable quarters\nthrough 2012\u2019s first three months. Ford earned $29.5 billion in\nthe last three years after $30.1 billion in losses from 2006\nthrough 2008.  Credit-default swaps on Ford dropped by the most this year\nafter the upgrade.  Contracts on Ford fell 57.3 basis points to a mid-price of\n262 basis points as of 4:28 p.m. yesterday in  New York ,\naccording to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles\nprices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Bonds Rise  The company\u2019s $1.25 billion of 8.125 percent notes maturing\nin January 2020 rose 2.5 cents to 130.5 cents on the dollar\ntoday in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting\nsystem of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt\nhas climbed from 123 cents on May 21.  Ford bonds will shift to Barclays Plc\u2019s U.S. Corporate\nInvestment-Grade index at the end of the month and be reflected\nin June returns, Brandon Ashcraft, a New York-based spokesman\nfor the bank, said today in an e-mail.  Ford common  stock  rose 2.2 percent to $10.41 at the close\nin New York. The shares have fallen 3.3 percent this year.  While recovering the collateral for the 2006 loan is a\ncapstone to Mulally\u2019s tenure, Bill Ford reiterated that he can\nremain CEO as long as he wants. Ford was Mulally\u2019s predecessor\nas CEO, running the automaker from late 2001 until September\n2006. Ford said he isn\u2019t going anywhere, either, and will ensure\nthe company never has to hock to blue oval again.  \u201cI do plan to be here a long time,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAnd I\ncan provide some institutional memory and make sure we never do\nslide back.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nKeith Naughton in Southfield, Michigan, at \n knaughton3@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJamie Butters at \n jbutters@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CME Group Inc. was 33.91957473754883 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CME Group Inc. was ",
