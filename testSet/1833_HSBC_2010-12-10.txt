 "context": "The following article called 'Euro-Area Bond Stokes Tempers as Flashpoint for Debt Markets: Euro Credit' was published on 2010-12-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA proposal to sell joint euro-region\ndebt has emerged as a new flashpoint among European leaders\nrunning out of options to stabilize bond markets.  With a European Union summit set for next week in Brussels,\nofficials from Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium and Greece said the\nproposal should be explored, prompting resistance from Germany,\nFrance and Austria. Economists and analysts from Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc., Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings Plc said it may end\nthe euro-region debt crisis.  The plan would establish a European Debt Agency to sell\nbonds to finance as much as 50 percent of EU member borrowing,\nclimbing to as much as 100 percent for countries unable to lure\n investors . Opponents say the proposal would raise interest rates\nfor stronger nations. The weighted-average five-year borrowing\ncost for the 16 euro-region nations was 3.05 percent yesterday,\ncompared with 1.95 percent on  German debt , data compiled by\nBloomberg show.  \u201cIt\u2019s very important that negotiations continue on the\npath of some kind common bond issuance and a more centralized\nfiscal policy,\u201d said  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income\nresearch at London-based HSBC. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this with\nthe ECB doing the heavy lifting. We need a more sustainable\nsolution.\u201d  A joint euro bond may be the first time one country has\nissued debt on behalf of another. In 1989, so-called Brady bonds\nwere issued by nations, including Colombia, Brazil and\nVenezuela, backed by the U.S. government. The bonds are named\nafter former Treasury Secretary  Nicholas Brady , who helped\ncreate the program.  Credit Agricole  The European Financial Stability Facility, the 440 billion-\neuro bailout fund set up by the EU after the Greece rescue,\nplans to sell bonds in January to pay for aid to Ireland. While\nbacked by most of the same nations that would be involved in a\neuro bond, it has attracted a AAA rating through a number of\ncredit enhancements and would therefore likely attract lower\nyields than a euro bond, according to analysts at Credit\nAgricole Corporate & Investment Bank.  Politicians are tabling ideas to tackle the euro-region\u2019s\nfiscal crisis after the European Central Bank was forced to step\nup its buying of government bonds when a bailout of Ireland last\nmonth failed to defend the region\u2019s bond markets against\ninvestors betting on a breakup of the euro.  Irish bonds  fell after the nation said Nov. 21 that it had\nasked for a bailout, with the 10-year yield reaching a record\n680 basis points more than benchmark German bunds on Nov. 30.\nYields have declined since the ECB stepped up purchases of bonds\nfrom Ireland, Portugal and Greece on Dec. 1, reducing the Irish-\nGerman spread to 503 basis points yesterday.  \u2018Intellectually Attractive\u2019  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  and Italian\nFinance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  put forward a plan for selling\njoint bonds in a Financial Times commentary on Dec. 6,\nheightening the current debate. The idea is \u201cintellectually\nattractive,\u201d EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said the same day, while Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  said it\u2019s time to \u201cseriously discuss\u201d it.  Juncker, who chairs meetings of euro-group finance\nministers, took a swipe at the German opposition, prompting a\nriposte from a key ally of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel .  Germany rejected his proposal to create euro-region bonds\ntoo quickly and has shown \u201csimple\u201d thinking on the matter,\nJuncker said on Dec. 8, Die Zeit reported citing an interview.\nGermany is dealing with European matters \u201cin an unEuropean\nway\u201d and the bond proposal was dismissed before Germany had\nexamined it properly, the German newspaper cited him as saying.  The Debate  Michael Meister , the senior finance and economy spokesman\nfor Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic bloc, shot back in an\ninterview later that day.  \u201cWe can\u2019t put any more on the table,\u201d Meister said in an\ninterview. Juncker and Tremonti \u201ccan surely say what they want.\nThey can go ahead with joint bonds if they want,\u201d he said.  The objections may not be final, Major said. Merkel opposed\nbilateral loans to Greece on the same grounds, before joining\neuro-region nations and the International Monetary Fund in\nproviding 110 billion euros of loans to the debt-stricken\nnation. Merkel also backs a change in the European Union treaty\nthat allows for the creation of a permanent crisis mechanism.  Merkel\u2019s stance is \u201ca negotiating position,\u201d Major said.\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario would be more expensive for Germany\u201d\nthan issuing common bonds, he said.  Euro Falls  The euro fell against most of its major counterparts today\nand yields on Spanish and Italian bonds jumped as leaders from\nGermany and France said they are against increasing the EU\u2019s 440\nbillion-euro rescue fund and rejected joint euro-area bonds.  \u201cCommon bonds would make governments less responsible,\nwhen what we want to do is the opposite,\u201d French President\n Nicolas Sarkozy  told reporters after meeting with Merkel today\nin the southern German city of Freiburg.  The creation of common bonds or bills for the euro area may\nhelp bring an end to the region\u2019s fiscal crisis by deepening\nmarket liquidity, according to  Sander Schol , a London-based\ndirector at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe.  The AFME\u2019s European Prime Dealers Association wrote a\nresearch paper for the European Parliament on the potential for\na common European Issuance Program. It found \u201csmaller liquidity\npremiums, more effective hedging and the removal of the market-\nmaking obligation would lead to lower interest rates,\u201d Schol\nsaid.  \u2018Optimal Risk Sharing\u2019  Such bonds might be the \u201coptimal risk-sharing scheme,\u201d\nGoldman Sachs rate strategist  Francesco Garzarelli  and economist\n Natacha Valla  said yesterday. Designed correctly, a joint bond\nprogram would create a financial incentive for fiscal prudence\nand reduce moral hazard,  Arnaud Mares , an executive director at\nMorgan Stanley and former senior vice president at Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, said on Dec. 6.  Compelling theory is unlikely to bring the plan to fruition\nanytime soon, according to said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income\nanalyst at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf.  \u201cFor Germany or France it wouldn\u2019t be at all attractive,\nbecause they would end up paying a higher yield,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a concept you can sell to the German electorate\nright now, and probably the same in Austria and France.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\n Matthew Brown  in London at \n mbrown42@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDaniel Tilles at   dtilles@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 30.22929573059082 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
