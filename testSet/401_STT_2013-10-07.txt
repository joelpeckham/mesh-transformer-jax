 "context": "The following article called 'Gensler Assesses U.S. Swap Rules Debut by Phone in Shutdown' was published on 2013-10-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGary Gensler  spent much of the past\nmonth fending off Wall Street\u2019s campaign to slow the move to\nelectronic swaps trading. So when the platforms went live last\nweek, the top U.S. derivatives regulator wasn\u2019t going to let a\ngovernment shutdown stop him from monitoring its progress.  With most of the staff at the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission\u2019s Washington headquarters on furlough, Gensler, in\nhis final months on the job, had to pick up the phone and call\naround to make sure the system was working. He pronounced\nhimself satisfied.  \u201cIt was a very good start,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\u201cThough the CFTC is in darkness with the shutdown, we\u2019ve been\nable to bring some additional light to the marketplace.\u201d  Market participants were more tentative.  Tom Zikas, managing director and head of eRates at  State\nStreet (STT)  Global Exchange whose firm received one of Gensler\u2019s\ncalls, said traders were still adjusting to the new rules and\nholding off on the new platforms. \u201cIt was a dead slow day\neverywhere,\u201d Zikas said.  It was a quiet start for one of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s main\nsolutions for making derivatives transactions less opaque.\n BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world\u2019s largest money manager, and clients\nof banks including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  decided to execute\nmany trades the old-fashioned way, over the phone. The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission also spooked some venues by\nsaying they may be violating securities laws.  Adjustment Time  While that didn\u2019t immediately fulfill Gensler\u2019s goal of\nbringing $633 trillion in derivatives trading out in the open,\nthe low volume gives the market time to adjust with fewer\ndisruptions, traders said.  \u201cThis is just the start of a ramp up,\u201d Kevin McPartland,\nhead of market structure and research at Greenwich Associates,\nsaid in a telephone interview. \u201cThe last thing the industry\nneeded was a big bang.\u201d  The CFTC, to ease the transition, granted a series of\ndelays for when traders must use platforms, including those\nowned by Tradeweb Markets LLC,  GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) ,  ICAP Plc. (IAP)  and\nBloomberg LP, the parent company of  Bloomberg News . The Sefs\nneeded to register with the agency by Oct. 2.  Clearing Deadline  There will be no delay for  hedge funds  and overseas\nbranches of banks, including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Citigroup\nInc., from an Oct. 10 deadline to guarantee interest-rate and\ncredit swaps at clearinghouses, Gensler said. The  American\nBankers Association , a Washington lobbying group, has pressed\nthe CFTC and Treasury Department for a delay, arguing that U.S.\nbanks will suffer competitively against overseas banks.  \u201cNon-U.S. customers have already started to respond by\ntaking their business to non-U.S. trading counterparties, to the\ndisadvantage of U.S. banks with overseas branches,\u201d  Frank Keating , the association\u2019s president, said in a Sept. 6 letter.  Gensler said in the interview that the deadline \u201cis firm\nfor the banks.\u201d  Most money managers decided against using the platforms on\nthe first day, according to a poll conducted by Boston-based\nresearcher and consultant Tabb Group LLC. Of the 36 investment\nfirms in the survey, 77 percent said they didn\u2019t use a Sef, 14\npercent said they did, and 9 percent said they sent only test\ntrades. The investment firms in the poll manage more than $6\ntrillion.  Blind Agency  The agency is unable to keep a close eye on the markets\nbecause of the shutdown.  \u201cWe have no ability at this point in time to monitor\nmarkets, to do surveillance and investigations,\u201d Gensler said\nin an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re but a skeleton staff. In many\ndepartments we have no people at all. And in others, we have\npeople to just insure the technology and property is secure.\u201d  About 30 of the agency\u2019s 700 employees were working after\nthe Oct. 1 shutdown, with most floors of the building staffed by\none or two workers, according to people with knowledge of the\nmatter.  Many divisions have a handful of people on hand to monitor\nmarkets or legal issues. The communications and legislative\naffairs divisions are shut down, while some senior staff members\nfor the agency\u2019s four commissioners have been furloughed.  SEC Challenge  One hiccup for the Sefs\u2019 debut occurred after the SEC\nwarned two of the new facilities -- run by ICAP and GFI Group --\nthat they may run afoul of securities regulations by offering\nswaps contracts that are supposed to be overseen by the\nsecurities regulator, rather than the CFTC.  According to two people familiar with the issue, SEC\nofficials raised questions about a half dozen contracts,\nincluding variance swaps, dividend swaps and swaps tied to\nindexes on asset-backed securities, the people said. Also on the\nSEC\u2019s list were options on credit indexes -- the same type of\nderivatives traded by JPMorgan\u2019s so-called London Whale, Bruno Iksil.  While the Sefs disputed some of the SEC\u2019s conclusions, they\nremoved the swaps from their electronic trading platforms so as\nnot to anger the SEC, the people said. The agency only\nsupervises about 5 percent of the market and it hasn\u2019t completed\nrules for electronic trading for those products, known as\nsecurity-based swaps. For now, that means they are mainly being\ntraded via the telephone.  \u2018Complicated Rule\u2019  The SEC \u201cwas saying, hold on a second, you\u2019ve got to do\nyour due diligence,\u201d said Julian Hammar, an attorney at the\nMorrison & Foerster LLP law firm and former assistant general\ncounsel at the CFTC who helped draft Dodd-Frank regulations.\n\u201cIt is a complicated rule.\u201d  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, said agency officials\ndecided to reach out to the Sefs after being given a list of\nproducts they were offering by the CFTC and noticing that a\nnumber of them were based on securities.  The CFTC, which normally would have been involved, was\nunable to participate in the calls because of the U.S.\ngovernment shutdown, he said.  Since the initial calls, the SEC has been in touch with\nmost of the new Sefs to review the guidelines for which products\nfall under the jurisdiction of which agency, Nester said.
