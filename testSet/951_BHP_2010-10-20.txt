 "context": "The following article called 'BHP Potash Bid Sweetener Said Rejected by Saskatchewan' was published on 2010-10-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSaskatchewan rejected an offer of\nC$370 million ($358 million) of infrastructure investment from\nBHP Billiton Ltd., which is trying to win support for its $40\nbillion bid for  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. , according to\nan e-mail from an official of the Canadian province.  The investment doesn\u2019t come close to offsetting the C$3\nbillion of revenue Saskatchewan will lose over 10 years should\nBHP acquire Potash Corp., said the official, who declined to be\nidentified because the talks between BHP and the province are\nprivate. BHP is confident it can address the province\u2019s concern\nit will lose revenue, the company said in an e-mailed  statement .  Saskatchewan Premier  Brad Wall  will set out the province\u2019s\nofficial position on the hostile takeover bid in a speech\ntomorrow, the government said yesterday. Canada has until Nov. 3\nto block the $130-a-share bid if it finds it doesn\u2019t provide a\n\u201cnet benefit\u201d to the country, unless BHP agrees to an\nextension of the review.  \u201cIf the local government rejects the deal you will find\nthat will flow through to the national level,\u201d David Lennox, a\nresource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney, said today by phone.\n\u201cThe Canadian government will then probably reject the deal as\nwell. That will be the finish of the deal.\u201d  BHP  declined  0.7 percent to A$40.88 at the 4:10 p.m. Sydney\nclose on the Australian stock exchange. Potash yesterday gained\n22 cents to $143.43 in New York, a 10 percent premium to BHP\u2019s\noffer.  Canada\u2019s Industry Minister  Tony Clement  said last week the\nfederal government is considering all points of view, including\nthat of Saskatchewan.  Andrew Dinsmore , a spokesman for the\nSaskatchewan government, wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment.  Blocking Power  Under the Investment Canada Act, the federal government can\nblock transactions if it finds they don\u2019t provide a \u201cnet\nbenefit\u201d to the country. There are \u201cserious questions\u201d as to\nwhether Melbourne-based BHP\u2019s offer meets the criteria of the\nnet-benefit test, Saskatchewan\u2019s Energy and Resources Minister\n Bill Boyd  said this month.  \u201cBHP Billiton is confident it can address this concern and,\nin this regard, is prepared to make commitments which go beyond\nthe requirements of prevailing Canadian legislation that should\neffectively address the tax loss concerns of the province,\u201d BHP\nsaid in the statement.  Lost Revenue  The Conference Board of Canada, an independent researcher\nof economic and public policy issues, said Oct. 4 in a report\nthat Potash Corp.\u2019s takeover by BHP would cost Saskatchewan C$2\nbillion in lost tax revenue over 10 years.  Potash Corp., which is based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan,\nhas rejected BHP\u2019s offer  as too low  and said it\u2019s seeking\nalternative offers amid rising prices for agricultural\ncommodities. Sinochem Group, China\u2019s largest fertilizer trader\nand cited by analysts as a likely counter bidder, may struggle\nto get state financial backing for a takeover, two people with\nknowledge of the matter said Oct. 7.  Saskatchewan has put pressure on BHP to remain committed to\n Canpotex , an organization that handles potash exports, on\nconcern its exit would reduce the region\u2019s revenue. Canpotex\nhandles exports for Potash Corp., Agrium Inc., and Mosaic Co.,\nwhich together account for as much as 40 percent of global trade\nin the nutrient.  BHP, already developing Canada\u2019s Jansen potash project,\nsaid in August it prefers to run its mines at full capacity and\nwould seek to sell its potash independently of Canpotex should\nits bid succeed.  Potash is a form of potassium used by farmers to strengthen\nstalks and roots and help crops fight disease. Potash Corp.\ncontrols 20 percent of global supply, according to the company\u2019s\nwebsite.
