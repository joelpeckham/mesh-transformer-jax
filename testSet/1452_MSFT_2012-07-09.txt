(MSFT)  said it will buy\nPerceptive Pixel Inc., a maker of large touch-screen display\nmonitors that can be used by multiple people at the same time.  Microsoft plans to sell Perceptive Pixel\u2019s large screens,\nwhich can run its latest operating system, Windows 8, the\nRedmond, Washington-based software company said at a conference\nin Toronto today. Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed.  Microsoft has a lot riding on the success of Windows 8, due\nto be released later this year. Perceptive Pixel\u2019s 82-inch\nmulti-touch screen, used by customers including news broadcaster\nCNN and oil-services provider  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) , can respond to\nfinger movements and a stylus at the same time, helping users\nmimic real-world work environments, according to the company\u2019s\n website . It will be another vehicle for Windows 8 sales to big\ncustomers such as corporations and schools.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a very big Windows 8 tablet, but people \u2018Ooh\nand ah\u2019 at it,\u201d Microsoft Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer \nsaid at the conference. \u201cOur challenge is to make that\ntechnology more affordable.\u201d  The displays currently sell for about $80,000, he said. The\nscreens can connect to standard corporate computers and already\nwork with Windows 8; Microsoft demonstrated one running the\nprogram at a conference in February.  Windows 8 will be shipped to manufacturers the first week\nin August and go on sale by the end of October, Microsoft said\ntoday. In the coming year, Microsoft expects to sell \u201ca few\nmillion\u201d units of its Surface tablet, Ballmer said.  Election Use  Perceptive Pixel  Founder  Jeff Han, who demonstrated multi-\ntouch technology at the  TED  conference in 2006, will join\nMicrosoft, with his team becoming part of the company\u2019s Office\ndivision.  The New York-based company gained prominence in 2008 when\ncable-news network  CNN  used one of its displays as a large\ninteractive U.S. map for presidential election coverage.  Now Han, who says many of his company\u2019s biggest  customers \nare top-secret defense and government projects, wants to take\nthe products more mainstream. To do that, he needs Microsoft\u2019s\nmuscle and better integration with Office programs like the\nOneNote note-taking application and Lync conferencing software,\nhe said in an interview.  Microsoft expects the acquisition to close this summer, and\nit will work hard to lower the price of Perceptive Pixel\nproducts, Giovanni Mezgec, a Microsoft general manager, said in\nan interview. He declined to give a specific month or say how\nmuch lower the prices may fall.  \u201cWe want to make this mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do\nanything possible to get the cost down and to get new forms of\nthis out in the market places in any way possible.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDina Bass in Seattle at \n dbass2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTom Giles at \n tgiles5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Microsoft Corporation was 24.75828742980957 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Microsoft Corporation was ",
