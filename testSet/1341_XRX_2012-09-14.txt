 "context": "The following article called 'J&J\u2019s Mulcahy Says Term Limits May Add Women to Boards' was published on 2012-09-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAnne Mulcahy , the former  Xerox\nCorp. (XRX)  chairman and chief executive officer and a director at\n Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ,  Target Corp. (TGT)  and  Washington Post Co. (WPO) , said\nlimiting the terms of company directors would help seat more\nwomen on U.S. boards.  The portion of female corporate directors has been stuck at\nabout 16 percent in the U.S., in part because board members can\nhold their positions for decades, Mulcahy said at a conference\nsponsored by the Women\u2019s Forum Inc. of New York yesterday. That\nleaves little opportunity for new blood, she said.  With  term limits , \u201cyour pool would inevitably be more\ndiverse,\u201d Mulcahy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very obvious reason this\nisn\u2019t working,\u201d she said, referring to slow progress in U.S.\ncorporate efforts to narrow the gender gap.  The number of women in boardrooms has increased worldwide\nsince the end of 2005 as countries instituted quotas and\ncompanies including  Facebook Inc. (FB)  added female directors after\ndrawing criticism for a lack of gender diversity. Still, the\nU.S. lags countries including Sweden and Norway. The latter\nstarted a mandate in 2003 and has reached its 40 percent quota.  Helena Morrissey, CEO of Newton Investment Management in\nLondon, started the  30 Percent Club  in the U.K. to press\ncompanies to employ that many female directors by 2015, up from\n12 percent in 2010. Morrissey, who spoke to the crowd of about\n200 women and men at the conference, said 55 percent of new\nboard appointments in the last six months in the U.K. were\nwomen. That compares with about 13 percent in 2010.  Board Members  Two terms of three years are typical for U.K. board\nmembers, she said. \u2018It\u2019s more of a job for life in the U.S.\u2019\u2019  Among other panelists were Dina Dublon, a former chief\nfinancial officer of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  who is now on the\nboards of  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,  Accenture Plc (ACN)  and  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , and\nShelly Lazarus, the former head of Ogilvy & Mather and a\ndirector at  General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Merck & Co. (MRK)   The Women\u2019s Forum asks executive search firms and board-\nnominating committees to sponsor women and enroll them on its\ndatabase which companies can  use  to consider potential board\ncandidates.  Some investors are directly asking companies to add women\nto their boards. Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance\nat the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System said she\nwrote a letter to Facebook urging it to add a woman to their\nboard. In June, the world\u2019s largest social networking service\nappointed Chief Operating Officer  Sheryl Sandberg  as its first\nfemale director.  Gender Equality  Still, Ed Kangas, the former CEO of  Deloitte Touche\nTohmatsu  who said he\u2019s been on at least 10 boards, has \u201cnever\nheard an investor even whisper about diversity ever,\u201d he said\nat the event.  Women made up 16.1 percent of U.S. directors according to a\nreport this year by  Catalyst , a nonprofit group that aims to\nexpand women\u2019s business opportunity. That compares with 27.3\npercent in Sweden, 24.5 percent in Finland and less than 1\npercent in Japan, according to Catalyst.  Women often aren\u2019t considered for boards unless they have\nprior board experience, Dublon said. Executives should focus\nfirst on moving women into positions running business units, she\nsaid.  \u201cBoards are the tail of one\u2019s professional career,\u201d\nDublon said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to force the increase without having\nmore people in executive management.\u201d  Spain Target  In Europe, some 13.7 percent of board seats in the European\nUnion are occupied by women, after a 1.9 percentage point\nincrease between October 2010 and January, the EU said in March.\nEU justice chief Viviane Reding is seeking to increase female\nboard members to 30 percent by 2015 and 40 percent by 2020.  Spain  has a target for 40 percent of female representation\non large company boards by 2015, and France passed a law last\nyear to impose a 20 percent quota by 2014 and 40 percent by 2017\nfor companies with at least 500 employees and annual sales of 50\nmillion euros ($65 million).  Shares of companies with a market capitalization of more\nthan $10 billion and with women board members outperformed\ncomparable businesses with all-male boards by 26 percent\nworldwide over a period of six years, according to a report by\nthe Credit Suisse Research Institute in August. The institute\nwas created in 2008 to analyze trends expected to affect global\nmarkets.  Companies with women on their boards also performed better\nin challenging markets than those with all-male boards,\naccording to the study, suggesting that mixing genders may\ntemper risky investment moves and increase return on equity.  The research, which includes data from 2,360 companies,\nshows a greater correlation between stock performance and the\npresence of women on the board after the financial crisis\nstarted four years ago. Globally, female board representation\nincreased to 59 percent last year from 41 percent at the end of\n2005, according to the report.
