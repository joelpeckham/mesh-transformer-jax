 "context": "The following article called 'Woodford Wields $51 Billion Wallet as U.K. Biotech Savior' was published on 2013-10-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAntony Odellneeded to raise money\nfor a biotechnology company with 19 employees and no sales, not\nan easy task in the U.K. Enter Neil Woodford, a star investor\noverseeing $51 billion at Invesco Fund Managers Ltd.  Odell followed a well-trodden path to Invesco\u2019s offices in\nHenley-on-Thames,  England , and Woodford agreed to invest about\n25 million pounds for 29 percent of  Tissue Regenix Group Plc. (TRX) \nPlenty of others make the same trek -- Invesco, via Woodford,\nowns stakes in small publicly traded companies such as  e-Therapeutics Plc  and  Retroscreen Virology Group Plc (RVG) , as well as\nunlisted, venture-capital-stage companies such as  Oxford\nNanopore Technologies Ltd.  and Circassia Holdings Ltd.  The positions have made Woodford one of the U.K.\u2019s biggest\ninvestors in early-stage health-care companies at a time when\nfinancing for the industry has shrunk. As investors shied away\nfrom risk amid the economic crisis, Woodford-managed funds\nplugged the gap with investments ranging from a few million\npounds to 100 million pounds, executives, analysts and others\nwho know him said in interviews.  \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for him, it would be quite grim,\u201d said\nNavid Malik, an analyst at Cenkos Securities in London who\nfollows some of the small companies Woodford invests in. \u201cThere\nwould be a few CEOs throwing themselves off the roof.\u201d  Financing for biotechnology companies in the U.K. fell 84\npercent to 363 million euros ($493 million) in 2012 from 2.2\nbillion euros in 2007, according to data compiled by Ernst &\nYoung.  Venture capital  declined 37 percent to 172 million euros\nand loans and initial public offerings ground to a near halt,\naccording to the firm.  Dividend-Paying Giants  U.S. companies, in contrast, have been able to count on\nincreased funding. Financing rose 7 percent in the U.S. in the\nsame period, according to Ernst & Young.  While cash from Woodford has been crucial to the U.K.\u2019s\nsmall health-care companies, the investments aren\u2019t even his\nmain focus at Invesco. Rather, the 53-year-old investor manages\nfunds totaling about 32 billion pounds ($51 billion) in assets,\nfocused on giant, dividend-paying companies. His 14-billion-pound flagship  Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund (INVHIII) , the U.K.\u2019s\nlargest stock mutual fund, counts companies such as\n GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , British American Tobacco Plc, BAE Systems\nPlc and BT Plc among its biggest holdings.  Woodford\u2019s dual role means he may be one of the few fund\nmanagers in the world courted by fledgling health businesses\nlike Odell\u2019s one day and CEOs of the world\u2019s biggest companies\nthe next. When Odell sat across from Woodford in November 2011,\nthe fund manager said Glaxo Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Witty \nhad occupied the same chair a few weeks earlier.  \u2018Small Fish\u2019  Invesco is the third-biggest investor in Glaxo, the U.K.\u2019s\nlargest drugmaker with a market value of 75.5 billion pounds.\nTissue Regenix, based in York, England, first sold shares on\nLondon\u2019s Alternative Investment Market in 2010 and was raising\nmore money in 2011 to develop replacement body parts made from\nanimal tissue, such as pig heart valves. The company has a\nmarket value of 66.1 million pounds.  \u201cYou\u2019re aware you\u2019re a very small fish in a very big\npond,\u201d Odell said in an interview. \u201cWe got into a discussion\nabout what it would take to fund these programs and Neil was up\nfor it.\u201d  Invesco Perpetual doesn\u2019t break out most of Woodford\u2019s\nholdings in smaller U.K. health companies. Woodford rarely talks\nto journalists and, through Invesco spokeswoman Lucy Forgan,\ndeclined to be interviewed.  Gene Sequencing  Biotech executives can find getting an audience with\nWoodford challenging, too. Oxford Nanopore Chief Executive\nOfficer Gordon Sanghera tried to see Woodford for four years\nbefore meeting him in 2011, the executive said.  Invesco invested in the closely held Oxford, England-based\ncompany, which is developing a portable gene-sequencing device\nfor about $1,000, in 2011. Oxford Nanopore has raised 145\nmillion pounds since it was  founded in 2005 . Charles Weston, an\nanalyst at Numis Securities in London, estimates the company\u2019s\nvalue at $1.5 billion.  Invesco also is the largest shareholder in  IP Group Plc (IPO)  and\n Imperial Innovations Group Plc (IVO) , publicly traded venture-capital\nfirms that invest in startups spawned by U.K. universities.\nImperial and IP Group are the source of some of Woodford\u2019s\ninvestments in up-and-coming companies.  Woodford learned about Tissue Regenix via IP Group, an\nearly backer, according to Odell. IP Group also was an early\ninvestor in Oxford Nanopore, Retroscreen and  Revolymer Plc (REVO) ,\nwhile Imperial backed Circassia, PsiOxus Therapeutics Ltd. and\nCell Medica Ltd. Invesco owns 29 percent of IP Group and 47\npercent of Imperial, both of which are based in London.  Invesco Park  \u201cHe uses his investments in those to cherry pick,\u201d said\nKate Bingham, managing partner of investment firm SV Life\nSciences Advisers LLP in  London . \u201cIt would be nice to have more\nlike him.\u201d  Woodford visits top managers or invites them to Perpetual\nPark, Invesco\u2019s collection of brick office buildings in Henley,\na town 38 miles west of London known for its summer rowing\nregatta and as the 13th richest in the U.K., according to a\nsurvey this year by real-estate firm Savills and The Telegraph\nnewspaper.  \u201cEvery company gets their 15 minutes of fame out at\nInvesco\u2019s park,\u201d said Mark Warne, IP Group\u2019s head of life\nsciences. \u201cHe insists on having a one-to-one conversation for a\ndecent period of time to get an idea of them.\u201d  Chewing Gum  Last year Woodford met with executives of Revolymer, which\nmakes polymers for use in nicotine gum and chewing gum products,\nbefore its 25-million-pound initial public offering.  \u201cIf he picks up the phone and says \u2018I want to see you\nabout your projects,\u2019 he will come down,\u201d Chief Financial\nOfficer Robin Cridland said. \u201cWe met him on the road show and\nwe met him for a long time. It was our job to persuade him.\u201d  Woodford doesn\u2019t meddle in day-to-day operations, company\nexecutives said. Tissue Regenix updates Woodford two or three\ntimes a year, Odell said.  \u201cHe does let them get on with it,\u201d Warne said. \u201cThe sums\nof money are to last several years so they can\u2019t keep coming\nback every six months.\u201d  About half of Woodford\u2019s stakes in publicly traded small\nhealth companies fall just below the U.K. Takeover Panel\u2019s 30\npercent ownership threshold that requires a shareholder to make\na cash offer for all the other shares, unless it obtains a\nwaiver.  Equestrian Center  Woodford, an economics and agriculture graduate of Exeter\nUniversity, rides horses at home in the Chiltern hills, where he\nlives with his family in a rambling manor house for which he\npaid 6.85 million pounds in May 2004, according to U.K. Land\nRegistry records. It\u2019s surrounded by a swimming pool, a show-jumping ring, oak gates and security cameras.  He made headlines in 2011 when he sought to redevelop a\nfarm in a neighboring village into an equestrian center, irking\nneighbors. The proposal failed after neighbors objected.  U.K. newspapers routinely cite Woodford\u2019s views on stocks,\nand he also weighs in on public policy and corporate strategy.\nLast month, he said the leader of the  Labor Party ,  Ed Miliband ,\ncommitted  \u201ceconomic vandalism\u201d  by proposing a freeze on energy\nbills. Invesco is the biggest shareholder in U.K. utility\nCentrica Plc. Woodford last year also criticized BAE Systems\nPlc\u2019s planned merger with European Aeronautic, Defence & Space\nCo., a deal that fell through.  Not all of Woodford\u2019s biotech investments have ended in the\nwinner\u2019s circle.  Antisoma Plc\u2019s (ASM)  stock price has slid for much of\nits 15 years as a public company, and Invesco dumped 22.9\nmillion of its 31.7 million shares of the the cancer-drug\ndeveloper as the stock plunged 64 percent on Jan. 31, 2011.  Still, his biggest fund, Invesco Perpetual High Income,\nreturned an average of 12 percent a year  the past five years ,\nbetter than 63 percent of competing funds, after Woodford\nsteered clear of banking stocks before the 2008 meltdown.  \u201cWhatever he\u2019s done, he\u2019s done very well,\u201d says Vadim Alexandre, an analyst at Daniel Stewart & Co. in London. \u201cHe\u2019s\ndefinitely a heavy hitter in the sector.\u201d  For Related News and Information:\nCredit Suisse Analyst Arnold Said to Join Wellington Management  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAndrea Gerlin in London at \n agerlin@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nPhil Serafino at \n pserafino@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of GlaxoSmithKline PLC was 31.648250579833984 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of GlaxoSmithKline PLC was ",
