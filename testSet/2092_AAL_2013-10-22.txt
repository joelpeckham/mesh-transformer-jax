The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina  Minmetals Corp., the nation\u2019s\nbiggest state-owned metals trader, is likely to drop out of the\nbidding for  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) \u2019s controlling stake in  Iron Ore Co.\nof Canada , according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Minmetals considers Rio\u2019s asking price too high and has\ndecided to focus more on its bid for a  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) \ncopper project in  Peru , one of the people said, asking not to be\nidentified because the information is private. Rio\u2019s 59 percent\nstake in Iron Ore Co. may be valued at as much as $3.5 billion,\nCredit Suisse Group AG analysts said in June.  Global mining companies including Rio,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) \nand  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  are seeking to sell some of their less-promising assets after a worldwide economic slowdown reduced\nconsumption of raw materials. Steel-demand growth from China\nwill slow in the next two years, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Rio began a sale of its Iron Ore Co. stake this year to cut\ncosts and strengthen its balance sheet, hiring Credit Suisse and\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to sell all or part of its\ninterest, a person close to the matter said in March.  He Jinglin, a media-relations official at Beijing-based\nMinmetals, said he had no information regarding the sale. Illtud\nHarri, a spokesman for London-based Rio, declined to comment.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada \u2019s second-largest mining\ncompany, is also considering abandoning its bid for the Rio unit\nbecause of a wide valuation gap, two people familiar with the\nmatter said earlier this month.  Failed Sales  Rio has struggled to sell other units. In June, the company\nsaid it backed away from divesting its diamond division after\nfailing to find a buyer and deciding not to pursue an initial\npublic offering of the unit. In August, Chief Executive Officer\nSam Walsh said a sale of Australian and New Zealand aluminum\nunits \u201cfor value is not possible in the current environment.\u201d  Minmetals is leading a group to bid for Glencore Xstrata\u2019s\nLas Bambas mining project, which would be valued at about $5\nbillion, two people familiar with the matter said this month.  The metals trader plans to contribute about half the\nfunding for the offer, while a unit of Chinese state-backed\nconglomerate Citic Group Co. would put in about 30 percent, the\npeople said. China Reform Holding Corp., an investment company\nbacked by China\u2019s state assets regulator, may contribute the\nremaining 20 percent of the financing, they said.
