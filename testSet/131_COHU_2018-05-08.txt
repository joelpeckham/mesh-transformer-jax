Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods and these non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the Company\u2019s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. Management views share-based compensation as an expense that is unrelated to the Company\u2019s operational performance as it does not require cash payments and can vary in amount from period to period and the elimination of amortization charges provides better comparability of pre and post-acquisition operating results and to results of businesses utilizing internally developed intangible assets. Manufacturing transition costs relate principally to employee severance expenses incurred as a result of moving certain manufacturing activities to Asia as part of our cost reduction efforts and employee severance are costs incurred in conjunction with the termination of certain employees to streamline our operations and reduce costs. Management has excluded these costs primarily because they are not reflective of the ongoing operating results and they are not used to assess ongoing operational performance. Acquisition costs, fair value adjustment to contingent consideration and inventory step-up costs have been excluded by management as they are unrelated to the core operating activities of the Company and the frequency and variability in the nature of the charges can vary significantly from period to period. Management believes the reduction of an uncertain tax position liability and related indemnification receivable is better reflected within income tax expense rather than a charge to SG&A and credit to the income tax provision. Excluding the impact of U.S. Tax Reform provides better comparability to our historical and future tax provisions. Excluding this data provides investors with a basis to compare Cohu\u2019s performance against the performance of other companies without this variability. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a replacement for (or superior to) corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and investors should be careful when comparing our non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies.\n(a) 10.5%, 5.5% and 9.9% of net sales, respectively.\n(b) To eliminate compensation expense for employee stock options, stock units and our employee stock purchase plan.\n(c) To eliminate the amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n(d) To eliminate manufacturing transition and employee severance costs.\n(e) To eliminate fair value adjustment to contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Kita.\n(f) To eliminate professional fees and other direct incremental expenses incurred related to the acquisitions.
