Many of those funds track sector-specific indexes and could be affected by the GICS changes.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI said in November 2017 they were planning changes to the categories and that they would be implemented after the close of business on Sept. 28, 2018.\nThe updates are meant to reflect changes to industries resulting from technology and acquisitions.\nAlso moving to the newly named Communications Sector are Twitter Inc and Snap Inc, both currently part of the Information Technology Sector.\nWalt Disney Co and DISH Network Corp, both currently in the Consumer Discretionary Sector, will also join the Communications Sector.\nComcast and Netflix currently fall under the Consumer Discretionary Sector, while Alphabet and Facebook are currently in the Information Technology Sector.\nReporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Chris Reese\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 129.60107421875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
