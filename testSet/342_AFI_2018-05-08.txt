 "context": "The following article called 'Armstrong Flooring Reports First Quarter 2018 Results' was published on 2018-05-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n- Net Sales of $257.9 Million\n- Net Loss of $10.4 Million\n- Adjusted EBITDA of $10.1 Million and Adjusted Net Loss of $6.1 Million\n- Reaffirms Outlook for Full Year 2018\nLANCASTER, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Armstrong Flooring, Inc. (NYSE:AFI) (\u201cArmstrong Flooring\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), North America\u2019s largest producer of resilient and wood flooring products, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nDon Maier, Chief Executive Officer, commented, \u201cOur strategic investments, product innovation, and distributor relationships generated significant sales growth in Vinyl Composition Tile (\u201cVCT\u201d) and Luxury Vinyl Tile (\u201cLVT\u201d). While first quarter 2018 net sales were lower due to continued challenges in certain legacy categories and higher distributor inventory levels at year-end 2017, we delivered Adjusted EBITDA in line with our full year plan. Looking to the balance of 2018, we believe our strategic initiatives are on track to accelerate net sales growth in the second half of the year. Additionally, we anticipate the combined impact of pricing, productivity and previously-announced cost saving actions will offset intensifying inflationary pressures within the industry, and we reaffirm our full-year 2018 outlook.\u201d\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Results Compared with First Quarter of 2017 Results\nConsolidated Results\n(Dollars in millions except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\n2017\nChange\nNet sales $ 257.9 $ 265.2 (2.7 %) Operating (loss) ($8.9 ) ($8.5 ) NM Net (loss) ($10.4 ) ($7.8 ) NM Diluted (loss) per share ($0.40 ) ($0.28 ) NM Adjusted EBITDA $ 10.1 $ 9.1 11.0 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 3.9 % 3.4 % 50 bps Adjusted net (loss) ($6.1 ) ($3.5 ) NM Adjusted diluted (loss) per share ($0.24 ) ($0.13 ) NM In the first quarter of 2018, net sales were $257.9 million as compared to $265.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to a decline in Wood segment net sales.\nFirst quarter 2018 net loss was $10.4 million, or a diluted loss per share of $0.40, as compared to a net loss of $7.8 million, or diluted loss per share of $0.28, in the prior year quarter. In connection with the previously-announced changes to our residential go-to-market strategy, during the first quarter 2018 the Company incurred one-time charges of $3.1 million primarily related to severance, which is expected to achieve $10 million to $12 million of annualized savings. Adjusted net loss was $6.1 million, or $0.24 adjusted diluted loss per share, as compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.5 million, or adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.13, in the prior year quarter.\nFirst quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA was $10.1 million, as compared to $9.1 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase primarily due to lower SG&A spending, including $4.3 million of customer reimbursements for prior investments in merchandising as well as the benefit of strong plant productivity and the previously announced plant closures, which more than offset the impact of lower sales and higher input costs.\nResilient Flooring Segment\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2018\n2017\nChange\nNet sales $ 163.5 $ 160.5 1.9 % Operating (loss) ($3.8 ) ($4.0 ) NM Adjusted EBITDA $ 9.7 $ 7.9 23.1 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 5.9 % 4.9 % 100 bps Net sales were $163.5 million as compared to $160.5 million in the prior year period. The increase in net sales was primarily due to double-digit growth in both VCT, helped by the acquisition of the VCT assets of Mannington Mills, and LVT. This improvement was partially offset by declines in legacy product categories.\nOperating loss was $3.8 million in the quarter as compared to an operating loss of $4.0 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.7 million as compared to $7.9 million in the prior year quarter, driven by improved SG&A and manufacturing costs, along with productivity gains, which more than offset higher input costs.\nWood Flooring Segment\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in millions) 2018\n2017\nChange\nNet sales $ 94.4 $ 104.7 (9.8 %) Operating (loss) ($5.1 ) ($4.5 ) NM Adjusted EBITDA $ 0.4 $ 1.2 (65.6 %) Adjusted EBITDA margin 0.5 % 1.2 % (70) bps Net sales were $94.4 million as compared to $104.7 million in the prior year quarter, with the decline driven by lower volumes in both solid and engineered wood. Volume was most impacted in the traditional channel.\nOperating loss was $5.1 million, compared to an operating loss of $4.5 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.4 million as compared to $1.2 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to the impact of lower net sales and higher input costs, which were partially offset by lower manufacturing and SG&A costs.\nShare Repurchase Program\nSince the inception of the program, the Company has repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at an aggregate value of $41.0 million under its share repurchase program authorized in March 2017.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company continues to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. The adjusted EBITDA outlook assumes sales growth in the low single-digits, weighted towards the second half of full year 2018. The Company continues to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million for the full year 2018 while delivering another year of free cash flow in line with recent years.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will host a live webcast and conference call to review first quarter results on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. ET.

Free cash flow is defined as net cash from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. The Company uses these adjusted performance measures in managing the business, including in communications with its Board of Directors and employees, and believes that they can provide users of this financial information with meaningful comparisons of operating performance between current and prior periods. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are appropriate to enhance understanding of its past performance, as well as its prospects for future performance. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in this release and on the Company\u2019s website. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most comparable GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures utilized by the Company may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The Company does not provide financial guidance for forecasted net income since certain items that impact net income are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted. Therefore, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of its Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n(Dollars in millions except per share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Total Resilient Wood Total Resilient Wood Net (loss) ($10.4 ) ($ 7.8 ) Interest Expense 0.9 0.5 Other Expense 0.6 0.9 Taxes -- (2.1 ) Operating (Loss) (8.9 ) (3.8 ) (5.1 ) (8.5 ) (4.0 ) (4.5 ) Depreciation and amortization 13.8 10.8 3.0 11.6 8.2 3.4 Expense related to plant closures, cost reductions, and multilayered wood flooring duties 4.2 1.9 2.4 4.7 2.7 2.0 U.S. pension expense 0.9 0.8 0.1 1.4 1.1 0.3 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10.1 $ 9.7 $ 0.4 $ 9.1 $ 7.9 $ 1.2 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 $ million Per diluted share $ million Per diluted share Net (loss) ($10.4 ) ($0.40 ) ($7.8 ) ($0.28 ) Expenses related to plant closures (including accelerated depreciation), cost reductions, and multilayered wood flooring duties 4.2 4.7 U.S. pension expense 0.9 1.4 Other Expense 0.6 0.9 Tax impact of adjustments at statutory rate (1.4 ) (2.6 ) Adjusted Net Loss ($6.1 ) ($0.24 ) ($3.5 ) ($0.13 ) Columns may not foot due to rounding.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180508005261/en/\nInvestors:\nDouglas Bingham, 717-672-9300\nVP, Treasury and Investor Relations\nIR@armstrongflooring.com\nor\nMedia:\nSteve Trapnell, 717-672-7218\nCorporate Communications Manager\naficorporatecommunications@armstrongflooring.com\nSource: Armstrong Flooring, Inc.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Armstrong Flooring, Inc. was 12.59000015258789 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Armstrong Flooring, Inc. was ",
