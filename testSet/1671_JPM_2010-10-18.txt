 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Homebuilder Confidence Rose to Four-Month High' was published on 2010-10-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nConfidence among U.S. homebuilders\nrose in October to the highest level in four months, a sign\nresidential construction is stabilizing at depressed levels.  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo\n confidence index  increased to 16, exceeding the most optimistic\nforecast in a Bloomberg News survey, from 13 the prior month,\ndata from the Washington-based group showed today. The gauge was\nprojected to rise to 14, according to the median estimate in the\nBloomberg survey.  Housing construction will be slow to recover after the end\nof a home buyers\u2019 tax credit and as foreclosures flood the\nmarket with cheaper homes.  Unemployment  near a 26-year high of\n10.1 percent is making it difficult for Americans to take\nadvantage of the lowest mortgage rates on record.  \u201cIt is encouraging to see a little more optimism on the\nhousing side, which might mean the sector is starting to\nstabilize,\u201d said  John Ryding , chief economist at RDQ Economics\nLLC in New York.  Index readings lower than 50 mean more respondents said\nconditions were poor. Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 47\neconomists ranged from 12 to 15. The measure reached a record\nlow of 8 in January of last year and averaged 54 in the five\nyears before the recession began in December 2007.  Stocks Rise  Stocks and Treasury securities maintained gains after the\nreport. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to\n1,179.17 at 10:31 a.m. in New York. The yield on the 10-year\nTreasury note fell to 2.52 percent from 2.56 percent on Oct. 15.\nThe S&P Supercomposite  Homebuilders Index  declined 0.3 percent.  The builders group\u2019s index of  current single-family  home\nsales increased in October to 16 from 13, and the measure of\nsales expectations for the next six months rose to 23 from 18.\nThe gauge of buyer traffic increased to 11 from 9.  The measure of builder confidence rose in all four U.S.\nregions.  \u201cBuilders are starting to see some flickers of interest\namong potential buyers, and are hopeful that this interest will\ntranslate to more sales in the coming months,\u201d NAHB Chairman\nBob Jones, a homebuilder from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, said\nin a statement.  With foreclosures reaching a record in September, U.S.\nregulators last week said they were investigating whether\nemployees of lenders including Ally Financial Inc., JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and  Bank of America Corp.  had falsified documents\nused in foreclosure proceedings.  Foreclosures Suspended  Ally Financial and Bank of America are among banks that\nhave suspended some foreclosures or evictions to review\npaperwork, which may further delay a recovery in housing as it\ntakes longer to clear inventory.  Work began on 580,000 homes at an annual pace in September,\ndown from 598,000 in August, according to the median forecast of\neconomists surveyed before a Commerce Department report\ntomorrow.  Housing starts  plunged to a record-low 477,000 pace in\nApril 2009 after reaching a three-decade high of 2.27 million in\nJanuary 2006. They rose to a 685,000 level in April this year,\nthanks to the $8,000 tax credit that expired that month.  Miami-based  Lennar Corp . is among companies finding other\nways to boost earnings as sales languish. The fourth-largest\nU.S. homebuilder by revenue bought about $740 million of\ndistressed loans and real estate from three financial\ninstitutions to boost earnings, the Miami-based company said\nOct. 1 in a statement.  The newly purchased loans and properties represent \u201can\nexcellent investment opportunity for our shareholders,\u201d Lennar\nChief Executive Officer  Stuart Miller  said in the statement. The\npackage includes about 397 loans and 306 properties in 17\nstates, primarily in the mid-Atlantic and Southeast.
