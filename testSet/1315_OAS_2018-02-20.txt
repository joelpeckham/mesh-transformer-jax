The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGENEVA (Reuters) - Sanctions should be stepped up against Venezuela\u2019s leaders and oil sector in response to the country\u2019s repressive political climate, the head of the Organisation of American States (OAS) said on Tuesday.\nUnder President Nicolas Maduro, \u201cdictatorship has become more tyrannical\u201d and the suffering of its 30 million people has increased amid dire shortages of food and medicine, said Luis Almagro.\n\u201cSanctions have to become harsher, this is the way to move forward. Those against dictatorship should unite,\u201d the secretary general of the 34-member OAS told a Geneva human rights forum organized by UN Watch, a non-governmental organization.\n\u201cWe must apply sanctions, harsher ones. We must starve the regime financially.\u201d\nSanctions have so far focused on individual members of Maduro\u2019s government and a ban on buying new Venezuelan debt.\nRestrictions on Venezuela\u2019s all-important oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the OPEC member state.\nAlmagro, asked by Reuters to elaborate on his remarks, later told reporters: \u201dThe sanctions should be not only personal sanctions, but sanctions also against the regime itself.\n\u201cThat makes it necessary of course to target oil production, it makes it necessary to target the family of the dictators, it makes it necessary to target money-laundering.\u201d\nMaduro will stand for re-election in April in a ballot opposition leaders plan to boycott. Critics say it is a farce, with his main rivals barred from standing and a compliant election body bound to favor the ruling socialists.\nMaduro denies the system is undemocratic and calls the OAS a pawn of U.S. policy.\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said two weeks ago at the end of a five-nation tour of Latin America that the United States was closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil.\nIrwin Cotler, a former Canadian minister of justice serving on an OAS panel investigating alleged crimes against humanity in Venezuela, said it would report its findings next month.\n\u201cWe heard compelling witness testimony and we received documentary evidence of extrajudicial executions and widespread systematic attacks on civilians as a matter of state policy,\u201d Cotler told the forum.\nHe cited cases of torture, rape, and arbitrary detention.\n\u201cWe are witnessing a dismantling of democracy, an assault on the rule of law and on the independence of the judiciary,\u201d he added.\nRights groups have said than 125 people died in anti-government protests last year.\nVenezuelan authorities have previously dismissed reports of such rights abuses as baseless.\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by John Stonestreet\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Oasis Petroleum Inc. was 7.470124244689941 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Oasis Petroleum Inc. was ",
