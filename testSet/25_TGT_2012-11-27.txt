The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nConsumer confidence  climbed to a four-year high,  home prices  increased by the most since 2010 and demand for business equipment rose, signaling resilience in the  U.S. economy  as the new year approaches.  The Conference Board\u2019s confidence  index  increased to 73.7 in November from 73.1 the prior month, the New York-based group said today. The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities advanced 3 percent in September from a year earlier. Bookings for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 1.7 percent last month, the most since May, the Commerce Department reported.  \u201cIt\u2019s good news starting out the fourth quarter,\u201d said  Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo- Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  New York . \u201cConcern that the fiscal cliff is a major roadblock to the recovery doesn\u2019t seem to be holding up.\u201d  Household finances and sentiment are getting a boost from a revival in the real-estate market, making it more likely that Americans will keep up the spending that accounts for 70 percent of the economy. At the same time, a rebound in business demand for machinery indicates that some companies were undeterred by the threat of automatic spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect in January.  Stocks fell as the budget debate in  Washington  overshadowed the improving economic data. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index dropped 0.5 percent to 1,398.95 at the close in New York.  Confidence Forecasts  The Conference Board\u2019s confidence index was forecast to climb to 73, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 75 economists. The measure averaged 53.7 during the recession that ended in June 2009.  Consumers are benefiting as record-low  mortgage rates  drive a recovery in housing. Sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly rose in October, according to the National Association of Realtors.  The Conference Board\u2019s report showed the share of Americans planning to buy a house rose to a record high, indicating a job- market recovery is making households more willing to make long- term commitments.  Among consumers who are more upbeat is Darshan Sampathu, 33, who works for an  advertising agency  in  Boston .  \u201cI feel like there is less risk these days, I\u2019m not as worried about my job as much,\u201d Sampathu said. \u201cSo I\u2019m a little bit more confident about buying things like electronics and things I\u2019ve been holding off buying the last few years.\u201d  Thanksgiving Openings  Thanksgiving Day openings and midnight deals at chains from  Target Corp. (TGT)  to  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  drew shoppers. Spending in stores and online rose 13 percent to $59.1 billion in the four days starting Nov. 22, the  National Retail Federation  reported. A year ago, sales advanced 16 percent over the holiday weekend.  Gap Inc., the biggest U.S. specialty-apparel retailer, saw busy stores on Black Friday as customers responded to offers of $19 sweaters and $5 kids and baby graphic Ts from midnight to noon.  \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing out there,\u201d Mark Breitbard, president of Gap\u2019s North America division for its namesake brand, said in a telephone interview on Nov. 23.  The percent of respondents in the Conference Board survey expecting more jobs to become available in the next six months increased to 20.3, the highest since February 2011, from 19.7 the previous month.  The share planning to buy a house within the next six months jumped to 6.9 percent, the most in data going back to 1964. The previous all-time high was 5.5 percent.  September\u2019s increase in the S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of property values in 20 cities followed a 2 percent advance in the year to August.  New York  Eighteen of the 20 cities in the index showed a year-over- year gain, led by a 20.4 percent surge in Phoenix. New York and  Chicago  posted the two decreases in values from a year earlier. year-over-year records began in 2001.  \u201cWith six months of consistently rising home prices, it is safe to say that we are now in the midst of a recovery in the housing market,\u201d  David Blitzer , chairman of the index committee, said in a statement.  The report also included quarterly national figures. Prices covering all of the U.S. increased 3.6 percent in the third quarter from the same period in 2011 compared with a 1.6 percent gain in the year ended June.  Today\u2019s durable goods report from the Commerce Department showed business investment may begin to rebound after companies held back on concern the so-called fiscal cliff might throw the economy into a recession next year.  Capital Goods  Demand for capital goods excluding defense equipment and aircraft, including items such as computers, engines and communications gear, climbed after a revised 0.4 percent drop in September that was larger than previously forecast.  Orders for all  durable goods  were little changed, beating the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg that projected a 0.7 percent drop.  Cleveland-based  Eaton Corp. (ETN)  is among companies saying customers are trying to find ways to meet rising demand even as they are concerned about the $607 billion in tax increases and spending cuts that may take effect next year if lawmakers don\u2019t act.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing short-term lease activity at a very high level,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Alexander Cutler said at a Nov. 13 conference, indicating companies would rather pay more for the flexibility that renting equipment provides in the short- term than commit to taking on a large purchase over the long run. \u201cPeople are paying a premium at this point to really deal with the uncertainty,\u201d he said.
