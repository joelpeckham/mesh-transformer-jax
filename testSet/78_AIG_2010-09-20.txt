The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSteve Roder , the former chief\nfinancial officer of  American International Group Inc. \u2019s main\nAsia life unit, and two insurance executives are seeking to\nraise funds for a new reinsurer based in Hong Kong.  \n The company will focus on Asia, Nomura Holdings Inc., which\nis acting as an adviser to the three reinsurer founders, said in\nan e-mailed statement. It is trying to raise $500 million to $1\nbillion of capital from institutional and corporate investors,\nsaid two people with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be\nidentified as the information is private.  \n Roder, who left AIA Group Ltd. in April, will be the CFO\nand deputy chief executive officer, with  Franz Josef Hahn , a\nformer executive at Swiss Reinsurance Co. and Munich Re, as the\nchief executive officer. Eckart Roth, a former global risk\nofficer at White Mountains Re, will assume the role of chief\nunderwriting officer, according to Nomura.  \n Asia and Australia accounted for 10 percent of global\nreinsurance premiums in 2008, compared with 42 percent for North\nAmerica and 37 percent for Europe, according to data from the\nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors.  \n \u201cWe believe there is an opportunity to form an Asian\nreinsurer and to play a significant role in the growth of the\nregion\u2019s reinsurance market,\u201d Hahn said in the statement. \u201cThe\nfounders are extremely excited by the opportunity and by the\nreaction so far of potential investors.\u201d  \n Backup Protection  \n Reinsurers, which sell backup protection to insurance\ncompanies, could benefit from the return to profitability of\nnon-life insurers in the region. PICC Property & Casualty Co.,\nChina\u2019s largest non-life insurer, expects to swing back to\nunderwriting profitability this year as payouts on natural\ndisasters abate, Chairman Wu Yan said in an interview on Jun. 26.  \n \u201cThey must have spotted opportunities or a niche in the\nmarket specializing in Asian risks and the forecast growth in\nreinsurance,\u201d said  Paul Clarkson , a Hong Kong-based analyst for\nrating company Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services LLC. \u201cIt\ncould be easier access to markets as a reinsurer rather than a\ndirect underwriter.\u201d  \n Most of the focus in the industry is \u201con establishing\nrelationships, understanding the markets and being able to\nadequately price the risks within the region,\u201d Clarkson said.  \n AIA IPO  \n Roder oversaw the preparation for Hong Kong-based AIA\u2019s\nfirst attempt at an initial public offering in the city before\nit was aborted in March when Prudential Plc made a $35.5 billion\noffer for the AIG unit. AIG, the New York insurer bailed out by\nthe U.S. government, revived plans for a Hong Kong IPO for AIA\nafter Prudential dropped the bid amid opposition from\nshareholders who said the offer was too expensive.  \n Roder declined to comment when contacted by phone today.  \n Hahn spent 24 years in the industry and Roth is an 18-year\nveteran who held senior positions at companies including Munich\nRe, the Nomura statement said.  \n The team planning to set up the reinsurer \u201cis being\nreceived warmly by potential investors,\u201d  Peter Goulston , head\nof insurance in Nomura\u2019s Asia ex-Japan investment banking\ndivision, said in the statement.  \n The statement didn\u2019t give a date for the planned start of\nthe new company, which awaits regulatory approval.  \n Financial Times  reported  the plan earlier today.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Bei Hu  in Hong Kong at \n bhu5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of American International Group, Inc. was 24.497526168823242 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of American International Group, Inc. was ",
