 "context": "The following article called 'Assured Guaranty Climbs to One-Month High After Reporting Profit' was published on 2012-08-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAssured (AGO)  Guaranty Corp. rose to the\nhighest in more than a month after the bond insurer reported\nprofit that beat analyst estimates.  Shares climbed 3.6 percent to $12.83 in New York Stock\nExchange composite trading, capping a 12 percent gain on the\nweek and reaching the highest since July 6. Credit-default swaps\non the company declined 1.5 percentage points to 12.3 percent\nupfront, according to data provider CMA. That means investors\npay $1.23 million initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10\nmillion of Assured debt from losses for five years.  Second-quarter operating income declined 20 percent to $114\nmillion, or 61 cents a share, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based\ncompany said in a statement yesterday after the close of the\nstock exchange. That beat the average estimate of 52 cents a\nshare in a Bloomberg survey of four analysts.  Assured said in court papers today that Stockton,\n California , isn\u2019t eligible for  bankruptcy protection  and that\nthe city\u2019s case should be dismissed because it failed to\nnegotiate in good faith with creditors and hasn\u2019t proved that it\nis insolvent. Stockton is trying to force the bond insurer to\naccept $100 million in losses instead of seeking more\nconcessions from labor unions, the company said.  Stockton filed a Chapter 9 bankruptcy on June 28 after\nmonths of talks failed with creditors, including Assured and\nlabor officials. Stockton said it filed after negotiating with\ncreditors on an out-of-court restructuring of its debts. The\nbankruptcy case is In re Stockton, 12-32118,  U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt , Eastern District of California ( Sacramento ).  Credit-default swaps, which typically fall as investor\nconfidence improves, pay the buyer face value if a borrower\nfails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted\ndebt.
