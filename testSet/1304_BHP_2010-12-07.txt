 "context": "The following article called 'RBA Keeps Rate Unchanged, Sees Inflation Little Changed Next Few Quarters' was published on 2010-12-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Reserve Bank of Australia kept\nits benchmark interest rate unchanged as the country\u2019s growth\nslows and risks to the global economic recovery persist, saying\ninflation likely will be contained through mid-2011.  Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board left the overnight\ncash rate target at 4.75 percent today in Sydney, as forecast by\nall 26 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News. After seven rate\nincreases since October 2009, Stevens said monetary policy is\n\u201cappropriate for the economic outlook.\u201d  Australia\u2019s economy this year may expand less than the\nRBA\u2019s forecast of 3.5 percent,  Citigroup Inc.  economists said,\nafter third-quarter growth was the weakest in almost two years.\nThe slowdown, a higher currency and rising household savings may\nhelp Stevens achieve his goal of cooling inflation as investors\nbet his next rate increase won\u2019t occur before March.  \u201cThe statement surprised me, I expected they\u2019d be less\ndovish,\u201d said  Adam Carr , a senior economist at ICAP Australia\nLtd. in Sydney. \u201cThey\u2019re implying now that rates are\nappropriate, whereas we had expected more rate hikes. Europe may\nbe weighing on their minds.\u201d  Australia\u2019s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.8 percent to\n4,726.8 after the decision, the highest closing level in almost\na month. The Australian currency was little changed, trading at\n99.14 U.S. cents at 4:24 p.m. from 99.08 cents just before the\nannouncement.  Dollar\u2019s Rise  The so-called Aussie is 8.6 percent stronger than a year\nago against the U.S. dollar.  The currency\u2019s strength \u201cwill assist, at the margin, in\ncontaining pressure on inflation over the period ahead,\u201d\nStevens said in his  statement . \u201cOver the next few quarters,\ninflation is expected to be little changed, though it is likely\nto increase somewhat over the medium term if the economy grows\nas expected.\u201d  Stevens also said \u201cthere continues to be a degree of\ncaution in spending and borrowing\u201d and a \u201cnoticeable\nincrease\u201d in the nation\u2019s savings rate.  The RBA\u2019s quarter-percentage-point increase last month was\nfollowed by larger moves in mortgage rates by the nation\u2019s four\nlargest banks. As a result, Stevens today said \u201clending rates\nin the economy are now a little above average.\u201d  Weaker Expansion  Since the Nov. 2 rate increase, some reports indicated\neconomic growth is decelerating.  Retail sales declined in October by the most since July\n2009, according to data released last week, and a private report\nshowed consumer confidence fell in November to a five-month low.\nHousehold spending accounts for about half of the nation\u2019s gross\ndomestic product.  Business profits also dropped in the three months through\nSeptember, the first quarterly decline in more than a year.  The economy grew 0.2 percent from July through September\nfrom the previous quarter, less than economists predictions of a\n0.4 percent expansion and the worst performance since a\ncontraction at the end of 2008, a government report showed on\nDec. 1.  Stevens, in his statement, said the creditworthiness of\nsome European governments has \u201cagain become the main focus of\nfinancial markets,\u201d while China and India have \u201ccontinued to\ngrow strongly.\u201d The U.S. is experiencing \u201cmodest growth,\u201d he\nsaid.  Mining Boom  The RBA is seeking to contain an expected acceleration in\ninflation as Australia goes through a resource investment boom\nthat is prompting companies to increase hiring to meet demand\nfrom China and India.  Australian employers probably added 20,000 workers in\nNovember, the ninth straight month of gains, according to a\nseparate Bloomberg survey ahead of a Dec. 9 report.  Stevens said today \u201cemployment growth has been very strong\nover the past year, though some leading indicators suggest a\nmore moderate pace of expansion in the period ahead.\u201d  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. , Australia\u2019s third-biggest\nproducer of iron ore, last month approved an $8.4 billion\nexpansion in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara region to almost triple\noutput as demand from steelmakers strengthens.  It joins  Rio Tinto Group , Vale SA and  BHP Billiton Ltd.  in\nannouncing expansions as prices increase. Producers are seeking\nto meet demand from steel mills in China, where consumption of\nthe alloy is forecast by Rio Tinto to double by 2020 from 2008\nlevels.  \u2018Overheating\u2019 Concern  Stevens said in a speech in Melbourne last week that \u201cwe\nobviously have to be wary of overheating,\u201d as the country\nundergoes \u201can event that occurs maybe once or twice in a\ncentury.\u201d  Australian consumer prices rose 2.8 percent in the third\nquarter from a year earlier, less than economists forecast and\nfollowing a 3.1 percent gain the previous three months, a\ngovernment report showed Oct. 27.  The RBA aims to keep inflation in a range of 2 percent to 3\npercent on average.  Traders bet there is an 88 percent chance Stevens will\nleave borrowing costs unchanged through the first quarter of\nnext year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on\ninterbank futures on the Sydney Futures Exchange.  \u201cThe Reserve Bank is clearly more relaxed and comfortable,\nbelieving that employment growth will slow and inflation will\nremain under control,\u201d said  Craig James , a senior economist at\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.  After today\u2019s decision, James said Commonwealth Bank\nchanged its rate view and now expects the next increase in April\ninstead of its previous forecast for February, with the cash\nrate to end 2011 at 5.5 percent rather than 5.75 percent.
