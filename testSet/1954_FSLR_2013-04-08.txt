 "context": "The following article called 'First Solar to Face Wall Street Questions After Brown Leaves' was published on 2013-04-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFirst Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker\nof thin-film solar modules, will issue its forecast for 2013\nsales to analysts and investors tomorrow, after announcing today\nthe departure of the executive who led its global effort to\nbuild utility-scale power plants with its panels.  James Brown , executive vice president for global business\ndevelopment, is leaving the company effective today, the Tempe,\nArizona-based company said in a regulatory filing.  First Solar has been completing power plants faster than\nnew contracts have come in, and it\u2019s not clear whether the\ncompany will be able to keep its project pipeline full, said Rob Stone, an analyst at Cowen & Co. in  Boston . Building and selling\nlarge solar farms accounts for about two-thirds of sales.  \u201cThere\u2019s enough in their pipeline to keep factories full\nthis year, but 2014 is a cause for concern,\u201d said Stone, who\nplans to attend the day-long meeting in  New York  tomorrow.\n\u201cThey\u2019re flying over the ocean and nobody seems to know whether\nthere\u2019s enough fuel to get across.\u201d  Chief Executive Officer Jim Hughes ended 2012 with\ncontracts that will provide $8 billion in expected revenue from\nsolar  power plants , down from $9.4 billion a year earlier, and\nsaid on a Feb. 26 conference call that he expects to maintain\nthat figure this year.  Revenue last year rose 22 percent to $3.37 billion as it\nsold some power plants and began work on new ones. Even with\nthose construction projects under way, sales may decline this\nyear to $3.13 billion, the average of 23 analysts\u2019 estimates\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Production Costs  Analysts are also looking for details on First Solar\u2019s\nexpenses. The company reported production costs of 68 cents a\nwatt in the fourth quarter, down from 73 cents a year earlier.  \u201cI would like to hear about how they reduce cost without\nsignificant  capital expenditures  and why Chinese competition\nwon\u2019t just decimate new markets,\u201d said Ben Schuman, an analyst\nwith Pacific Crest Securities LLC in  Portland ,  Oregon .  First Solar rose 2.3 percent to $27.04 at the close in New\nYork. The shares have slumped 12 percent this year.  First Solar has about 1,800 megawatts of panel production\ncapacity, mainly in Malaysia and the U.S.  (The analyst meeting begins at 9 a.m. in New York and will\ncontinue to 4 p.m. To listen to a webcast, go to the company\u2019s\nsite at  http://investor.firstsolar.com/events.cfm )  To contact the reporter on this story:\nChristopher Martin in New York at \n cmartin11@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nReed Landberg at \n landberg@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of First Solar, Inc. was 26.440000534057617 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of First Solar, Inc. was ",
