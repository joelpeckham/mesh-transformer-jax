The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWater utilities should adopt pricing\nstructures that encourage consumers to curb water use in order\nto meet demand that industry leaders say may outstrip supply by\n2030, according to a survey by  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)   The survey of 244 senior water utility executives found\nwasteful consumer behavior to be the biggest barrier in meeting\nrising demand that\u2019s also driven by growing populations and\nclimate change, Oracle said in the report released today.  \u201cThe threat of water scarcity is not an insurmountable\nchallenge but to overcome it, water utilities will need to make\nmuch more productive use of water available and better educate\ntheir customers about its value,\u201d  Brian Gardner , senior editor\nat the Economist Intelligence Unit,  said in a statement\naccompanying the report.  The study showed 49 percent of the respondents believe\npricing structures need changing to prompt consumers to conserve\nwater while 38 percent said prices should be held down to\nincrease access to the resource, according to the study\nconducted by the EIU.  More than a third of the executives surveyed said the risk\nof demand outstripping supply by 2030 is \u201chighly likely\u201d or\n\u201cessentially certain,\u201d according to the study. Failure to take\naction could lead to \u201csignificant economic, social and health\nimplications,\u201d according to Oracle, based in  Redwood City ,\n California .  Oracle, the biggest maker of  database software , provides\nsmart meter management software to Veolia and Suez Environnement\nin  France , the largest water companies.  Most water utilities are increasing investments to meet\nsupply challenges, with 22 percent surveyed boosting spending by\n15 percent or more in the next three years, according to the\nsurvey. The biggest risks facing utilities are drought and\nincreased water pollution, according to the study, which said\nhalf of those surveyed found government support lacking to\naddress water scarcity.
