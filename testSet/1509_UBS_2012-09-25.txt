 "context": "The following article called 'UBS Co-Workers Knew of Fake Trades, Adoboli Told Lawyer' was published on 2012-09-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nKweku Adoboli\u2019s co-workers knew he\nwas making fictitious trades, the former  UBS AG (UBSN)  banker told an\nattorney who interviewed him on the night of his arrest in\nSeptember 2011.  Adoboli told  Damien Byrne Hill , a lawyer at Herbert Smith\nLLP who represented the Swiss bank, that his colleagues on the\nexchange-traded funds desk were aware of fake trades from May,\nthough they didn\u2019t know the extent of his positions.  Hill\u2019s notes from the discussion with Adoboli, read out by\na prosecutor at the former trader\u2019s fraud trial in London\nyesterday, indicated that while his colleagues were \u201cunhappy\u201d\nabout the trades, they didn\u2019t alert managers.  \u201cI f----d up,\u201d Adoboli said he told the other traders,\naccording to the lawyer\u2019s notes. \u201cI\u2019m trying to make it a bit\nbetter.\u201d  Adoboli, 32, has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and\nfalse accounting over unauthorized trades on which UBS lost $2.3\nbillion. The former trader admitted hours before his arrest that\nhe had risked $5 billion on Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 futures and a\nfurther $3.75 billion in the German futures market, a former\nmanager testified.  John Hughes , the former senior trader on the ETF desk, said\nAdoboli told him in January last year about an internal account\nhe called his umbrella. Prosecutors allege Adoboli created the\naccount to pool profit from trades he hadn\u2019t booked to use to\ncover up future losses.  An Umbrella  \u201cYou live in blue sky scenarios,\u201d Hughes wrote in an\ninstant-message exchange with Adoboli in January 2011.  \u201cIt often rains,\u201d Adoboli responded. \u201cI learned that\nlast year. So I built an umbrella.\u201d  Hughes, 30, testified he thought the umbrella referred to a\nprofit pool that hadn\u2019t been booked and could be used later. He\nsaid he didn\u2019t report his colleague, \u201cbecause I\u2019m stupid.\u201d  \u201cI should have reported him,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cTo this day,\nI wish I had.\u201d  Hughes said he had reported Adoboli for exceeding his\ntrading limits in December 2010 to John Bennie, a senior\nequities trader at UBS, and afterwards felt guilty about it\nbecause Adoboli was \u201ctold off.\u201d  Hill\u2019s notes indicated Adoboli admitted building up\npositions of as much as $10 billion by August 2011 and masking\nthem with fictitious ETF trades. When other traders noticed he\nwas stressed, Adoboli told them it was a result of splitting up\nwith his girlfriend, according to Hill\u2019s notes.  Risk Ethos  Phil Allison, UBS AG\u2019s head of global cash equities,\ntestified that there was \u201ca change of ethos\u201d under former\nChief Executive Officer  Oswald Gruebel  who encouraged more risk\ntaking at the bank, including proprietary trading, to increase\nprofits.  \u201cIf a bank doesn\u2019t take any risk, it is incredibly hard to\nmake money, and that is our job,\u201d Allison said. Gruebel thought\n\u201cthere was room for more market risk, which in general was a\nview I agreed with.\u201d  Gruebel stepped down after the loss the bank attributed to\nAdoboli.  Allison said he has spent \u201csleepless nights\u201d thinking\nabout whether he missed red flags that Adoboli may have been\nplacing unauthorized trades.  \u201cWe felt we were putting two intelligent individuals in\nthe center of the floor\u201d when the bank put Adoboli and his\nformer colleague John Hughes in charge of the exchange-traded\nfunds desk, Allison said. \u201cIt is not one where I\u2019ve thought,\n\u2018Gosh, that\u2019s something I should\u2019ve done differently.\u2019\u201d  Allison said he wished that the bank had \u201cclearly written\nand documented\u201d their risk limits.
