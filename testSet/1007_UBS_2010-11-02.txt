 "context": "The following article called 'Japan's Topix Falls for Seventh Day on Fed Outlook; Honda Leads Decline' was published on 2010-11-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMost Japanese stocks fell, dragging\nthe  Topix index  to its seventh consecutive decline, as the yen\ntraded near a 15-year high before this week\u2019s meetings of the\nU.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan.  Honda Motor Co. , Japan\u2019s second-largest carmaker, declined\n2.3 percent. Advantest Corp., the world\u2019s biggest maker of\nmemory-chip testers, sank 1.3 percent. Sumitomo Chemical Co. and\nFujikura Ltd., a cable maker, dropped at least 4 percent after\nreporting earnings that missed their forecasts. Mitsubishi\nChemical Holdings Corp. and Yokohama Rubber Co. rose at least\n2.5 percent after the companies increased their profit\nforecasts.  The  Topix  index fell less than 0.1 percent to 803.12 in\nTokyo, its lowest close since April 2009. Almost twice as many\nstocks declined as advanced. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained\n0.1 percent to 9,159.98 after retreating as much as 0.3 percent.  \u201cPeople don\u2019t know whether the yen\u2019s trend will change or\nnot, so they cannot price in strong earnings,\u201d said  Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa Asset Management\nCo., which oversees about $104 billion. \u201cThere is no clear\nconsensus on how the Fed will set monetary policies.\u201d  The Bank of Japan said last week that policy makers\nadvanced their next session to Nov. 4-5, following a meeting by\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve on Nov. 2-3. Japanese markets are\nclosed tomorrow for a public holiday.  \u2018Selective Buying\u2019  \u201cInvestors will refrain from active trading and there\u2019ll\nbe selective buying,\u201d said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at\nTokyo-based SMBC Friend Securities Co.  The Nikkei 225 has decreased 13 percent this year, the most\namong the world\u2019s 40 largest equity markets. Shares in the gauge\ntrade at 16.2 times estimated earnings on average, the lowest\nlevel in a month.  Honda Motor sank 2.3 percent to 2,725 yen, the  heaviest\ndrag  on the Topix and the Nikkei. Mazda Motor Corp., Japan\u2019s\nsecond-largest car exporter, dropped 1 percent to 202 yen.\nAdvantest lost 1.3 percent to 1,474 yen, the lowest close since\nApril 2009. Sony Corp., an electronics maker that derives about\n70 percent of its revenue abroad, fell 0.9 percent to 2,627 yen.  The yen traded at 80.60 against the dollar at 3 p.m. in\nTokyo and appreciated to 80.22 yesterday, the highest level\nsince 1995. The yen is on course for its strongest annual\naverage level since currencies began trading freely in 1971,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on each day\u2019s\nclosing price. A stronger yen reduces the value of companies\u2019\noverseas revenue when converted to their home currency.  Fujikura Plunges  More than five companies have  exceeded profit estimates  for\nevery four that have fallen short, based on Bloomberg data\ncompiled from about 630 companies that have reported quarterly\nresults since Oct. 7. About 360 companies out of more than 1,650\nin the  Topix are scheduled  to announce earnings this week,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The cable maker said operating profit in the\nApril-September period fell 16 percent to 7.72 billion yen\n($95.8 million), lower than the company\u2019s target of 8 billion\nyen. Fujikura had its rating reduced to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d\nat UBS AG.  Sumitomo Chemical  tumbled 4.1 percent to 332 yen, the\nlowest since Nov. 27. The company said its first-half net income\nfell short of its forecast and reduced its full-year outlook by\n78 percent to 10 billion yen, citing the yen\u2019s appreciation and\ngoodwill depreciation.  Elpida\u2019s Profit Drops  Elpida Memory Inc., the world\u2019s third-biggest maker of\ncomputer-memory chips, slumped 5.1 percent to 764 yen, a level\nnot seen since April 2009. The company said in a preliminary\nearnings statement it had second-quarter net income of 8.8\nbillion yen. That was less than its first-quarter profit of 30.7\nbillion yen. Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. and\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered their  share-price estimates  on\nthe company.  \u201cThe shortfall in second-quarter earnings raises the\npossibility of earnings missing the consensus estimate,\u201d for\nthe full year,  Takeo Miyamoto , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG,\nwrote in a report dated yesterday. \u201cInvestors need to watch\ndevelopments\u201d of dynamic-random-access-memory prices, according\nto Miyamoto, who rates Elpida \u201csell.\u201d  The  Nikkei fluctuated  between a gain of 0.2 percent and a\ndrop of 0.3 percent today. The gauge moved within a range of\n48.41 points, the narrowest since March 10.

Yokohama Rubber rallied 2.5 percent to 403 yen, the most in\nalmost two months. The company boosted its full-year net income\nforecast 44 percent to 11.5 billion yen, citing cost cuts.  Brokerages advanced the  most among the Topix\u2019s 33 industry\ngroups  today, rebounding from a 9.2 percent decline from Oct. 26\nto Nov. 1, as earnings slumped at Nomura Holdings Inc. and Daiwa\nSecurities Group Inc. and on concern about declines in\nsecurities transaction fees amid shrinking trading volume.\nNomura jumped 4.3 percent to 414 yen while Daiwa climbed 1.6\npercent to 327 yen.
