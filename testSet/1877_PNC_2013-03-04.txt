 "context": "The following article called 'Goldman Joins Citigroup in Expanding Cyber Threat Lists' was published on 2013-03-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  stepped up warnings to shareholders about cyber attacks as the U.S. prodded banks and government agencies to bolster their defenses.  Online and mobile banking give new points of entry that can be used to disrupt or penetrate operations, the two New York- based firms said last week in annual regulatory filings. The companies said they\u2019re vulnerable to tactics that overload websites to shut off public access, such as assaults that disrupted the nation\u2019s largest lenders late last year.  U.S. banks are speculating that foreign nations, organized crime or terrorists are behind efforts to cripple their websites and warning that costs to keep intruders at bay will rise. President  Barack Obama  directed the government on Feb. 12 to develop voluntary security standards for companies running vital infrastructure and is pushing Congress to set formal rules.  \u201cWe are going to see more disclosures, and that\u2019s a warning sign that things are really getting bad,\u201d said Lawrence Ponemon, chairman of Ponemon Institute LLC, a Traverse City, Michigan-based security research firm, which predicts a 30 percent increase in expenses tied to cyber intrusions this year.  Attacks in December hit  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , U.S. Bancorp,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , two executives at security companies said at the time. PNC Financial Services Group Inc., the second-biggest regional bank, said in its annual filing that cyber attacks may hurt customer confidence and increase costs at the Pittsburgh-based company.  Security Breaches  The intrusions aren\u2019t limited to financial firms, with Microsoft Corp., the largest software maker, saying Feb. 22 a small number of its computers were infected by malicious software in a cyber attack similar to those experienced by Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.  Cyber security gained renewed national attention in the past few years with revelations about a security breach of a U.S. Federal Reserve website, intrusions at the  New York Times (NYT)  and other news organizations attributed to Chinese hackers, and a wave of so-called denial-of-service attacks that disrupted the websites of the biggest U.S. banks and payment networks.  The tactic can disable a website by flooding it with traffic. While that doesn\u2019t give intruders access to cash or personal data, regulators warned banks in December the attacks might be used to distract staff while accounts are penetrated, or to block banks and customers from informing each other.  New Threat  \u201cWe know hackers steal people\u2019s identities and infiltrate private e-mail; we know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets,\u201d Obama said in his  State of the Union  speech. \u201cNow our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our  power grid , our financial institutions and our air- traffic-control systems.\u201d  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the second-biggest U.S. payments processor, said in its Feb. 14 annual filing the firm routinely receives threats, \u201cand our technologies, systems and networks have been subject to cyber attacks.\u201d So far, the impact hasn\u2019t been material, according to the Purchase, New York-based firm.  U.S. Bancorp, ranked fifth by deposits among commercial banks, told regulators Feb. 22 it had been  targeted , and that it might not be able to stop all attackers \u201cbecause the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.\u201d The Minneapolis-based lender cited organized crime, terrorists and hostile foreign governments, and said risks increase as it adds more Internet and mobile-banking options.  Testing Defenses  Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S.  home lender , reiterated in its Feb. 27 filing that attacks against banks may be meant to \u201ctest their cyber security in advance of future and more advanced cyber attacks,\u201d and said preventing or cleaning up after intrusions may get expensive for the San Francisco-based firm. It didn\u2019t specify the cost.  Bank of America, whose customers complained that websites run by the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company were repeatedly slowed or knocked offline, previously acknowledged it had faced a series of denial-of-service attacks and may be required to spend significant amounts to address future attacks.  The bank, ranked second by assets, didn\u2019t add any detail in its latest filing, and spokesmen for all the lenders declined to elaborate on their cyber-security measures.  \u2018Frightening Number\u2019  Non-U.S. companies also felt the impact. HSBC Finance Corp., the Illinois-based unit of Europe\u2019s largest bank by market value,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , said in today\u2019s regulatory filing it faced several denial-of-service attacks last year across Latin America, Asia and North America.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) \u2019s CEO  Gordon Nixon  told shareholders last week the number of attacks faced daily by his Toronto-based company is \u201cfrightening.\u201d  \u201cThe good news is they don\u2019t get through the firewalls and our various protective measures have served us extremely well,\u201d Nixon said at the bank\u2019s Feb. 28 annual meeting.  With incidents becoming widespread, banks are putting aside rivalries and collaborating more closely on how to block intruders, said Ed Powers, a principal at  Deloitte & Touche LLP  in New York who specializes in information security and risk management.  \u201cThese attacks have started to go beyond nuisance,\u201d Powers said in an interview. While none has resulted in a \u201ccatastrophe,\u201d it\u2019s reasonable to foresee something much more disruptive ahead, he said.  Spy Agencies  Mobile and online banking are adding vulnerability, as are customers and vendors who link directly to data systems, Fed Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  told bankers and regulators last week during an Atlanta speech. That has led to \u201cconcerted cooperative work between government and financial institutions,\u201d and the Department of  Homeland Security  has provided firms with technical assistance, she said.  The biggest U.S. banks work closely with the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, Defense Department and governments around world to address \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of cyber attacks, according to  Jamie Dimon , chief executive officer of New York-based JPMorgan.  \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal; it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d Dimon, 56, said during an Oct. 10 panel discussion at the  Council on Foreign Relations . \u201cComputers in 10 years are going to be a hundred thousand times faster. And so they\u2019ll be able to do calculations quicker and get through quicker.\u201d  Opportunity Cost  Cyber threats could cost firms the opportunity to improve their systems and save money. Travelers Cos., which represents the  insurance industry  in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , said Feb. 19 it  may forgo  new and more efficient technologies if they further expose the New York-based company to attacks.  A group calling itself Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has claimed responsibility for the most recent intrusions on U.S. banks, saying they\u2019re in response to a video uploaded to Google Inc.\u2019s YouTube ridiculing the  Prophet Muhammad  and offending some Muslims. NBC News and former Senator  Joseph Lieberman , a Connecticut independent, have said Iran may have been behind these attacks.  The group hit U.S. bank websites with a new round of denial-of-service attacks on Feb. 25, according to Rodney Joffe, senior vice president at Neustar Inc. of Sterling, Virginia, and Carl Herberger, a vice president of security solutions at Tel Aviv-based Radware Ltd., who both provide security to some of the targeted banks.  In a statement posted on the website pastebin.com on Feb. 26, the group said it targeted more than 11 banks for new assaults including Bank of America and PNC.  Obama\u2019s Edict  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  told companies  in October 2011 they should disclose real or potential cyber attacks capable of disrupting business operations or financial stability and should address the threat if a network breach is \u201creasonably likely\u201d to have a material effect.  Obama\u2019s executive order includes parts of Senate legislation that failed to pass last year. Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation\u2019s largest business lobby, said the bill\u2019s standards would amount to burdensome regulation.  The Obama administration soon will submit priorities for cyber security legislation to Congress to build on his executive order, said Caitlin Hayden, a White House spokeswoman.  \u201cAlthough this executive order will help raise the nation\u2019s cyber defenses, it does not obviate the urgent need for legislation,\u201d Hayden said last week via e-mail. She didn\u2019t specify the priorities or the timeframe for sending them to Congress.
