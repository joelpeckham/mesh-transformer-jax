 "context": "The following article called 'Tesla Profit Aided by Sales of California, U.S. Credits' was published on 2013-05-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) \u2019s first quarterly\nprofit, led by a surge in deliveries of the electric-car maker\u2019s\nModel S, got an added bump from sales of California and U.S.\nenvironmental credits that generated 15 percent of revenue.  Such sales totaled $85 million, the  Palo Alto , California-based company said in a May 10 filing. That included California\nzero-emission vehicle credits of $67.9 million and \u201cother\nregulatory credits\u201d of $17.1 million, Tesla said. The latter\namount, mainly from U.S. rules, wasn\u2019t detailed in the first-quarter earnings on May 8, said Jeff Evanson, a spokesman.  The automaker, led by billionaire Elon Musk, has surplus\ncredits because it sells only electric vehicles, which don\u2019t\nproduce tailpipe emissions. Tesla reported quarterly net income\nof $11.2 million, beating analysts\u2019 estimates, on 4,900 sales of\nthe Model S, which has $69,900 base price.  Tesla gained 14 percent to a record $87.80 at the close in\n New York . The  shares  have more than doubled this year, as the\nRussell 1000 Index rose 15 percent.  California requires large carmakers to have varying amounts\nof zero-emission vehicle credits from electric auto sales to\ncurb tailpipe exhaust. Tesla also has credits to sell under\nfederal regulations on fuel economy and greenhouse-gas\nemissions. The company didn\u2019t identify buyers of the credits.  The first-quarter revenue from zero-emission credits was\nprobably a peak for the year, Chief Executive Officer Musk, 41,\nsaid in a conference call last week.  \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a decline in ZEV credit revenue for Q2,\nand then, probably a fairly significant decline in Q3,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cWe are not expecting anything in Q4.\u201d  Sales from zero-emission credits, which are included in\nautomotive revenue, were disclosed last week because they are\ntypically more volatile than other types of environmental\ncredits, Evanson said, without elaborating.  The company\u2019s total quarterly  sales  were $561.8 million,\nincluding $555.2 million in automotive revenue.
