 "context": "The following article called 'Dubai Expo Bet Spurs Property-Led Debt Rally: Islamic Finance' was published on 2013-10-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAs spotless black sedans shuttled\nWorld Expo officials through Dubai\u2019s streets last week, yields\nof Islamic bonds from local developers  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  and\nNakheel PJSC dropped to record lows.  The declines underscored growing optimism that the Middle\nEast business hub and second-richest member of the  United Arab\nEmirates  will be named as host of the  2020 event  when members of\nthe  Bureau International des Expositions  vote in Paris next\nmonth. Sukuk from Emaar, developer of the world\u2019s tallest tower,\nand Nakheel, which built Dubai\u2019s artificial palm-shaped island,\nare rising even as regional peers retreat.  \u201cReal estate is the first sector to come to mind in terms\nof beneficiaries of a win,\u201d Yaser Abushaban, executive director\nof asset management at  Emirates Investment Bank PJSC (EIBANK) , said by\nphone from Dubai Oct. 24. \u201cIt would have a positive impact on\nsentiment and pricing, and not just in construction and real\nestate. There could be a boom across economic sectors.\u201d  Selection would be a milestone in Dubai\u2019s recovery\nfollowing the property crash that wiped 65 percent off values\nand a 2009 request to delay $25 billion of debt payments.\nWinning the right to host the Expo would prompt 26 billion\ndirhams ($7.1 billion) of infrastructure, HSBC Holdings Plc said\nin a Sept. 25 research note. Economic growth will receive a 0.5\npercentage-point boost per year and about 2 percentage points in\n2020,  Bank of America Corp.  said in a Sept. 26 report.  Win\u2019s Effect  The yield on Nakheel\u2019s sukuk due August 2016 fell to an\nall-time low of 7.15 percent at 12:56 p.m. in Dubai, bringing\nits drop this year to 212 basis points, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The rate on Emaar\u2019s bond due the same\nmonth tumbled to 3.45 percent, a decline of 96 basis points.\nThat compares with a 110 basis-point increase to 4.28 percent on\nOct. 25 for average corporate sukuk in the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil, HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai indexes show.  \u201cEmaar will benefit significantly by being strong in both\nhospitality and real estate,\u201d Amol Shitole, a Bangalore, India-based credit analyst at SJ Seymour Services Pvt. Ltd., said by\nphone Oct. 23. \u201cIf Dubai wins the Expo, there will be further\ntightening of the yields on real estate credit.\u201d  A delegation of representatives of the 167 member nations\nof the  Bureau International des Expositions  toured Dubai the\nweek of Oct. 21 to assess its bid, visiting landmarks including\nJebel Ali port and Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building. A\n decision is expected  at the Bureau\u2019s two-day meeting scheduled\nto begin Nov. 26.  Desert Pavilions  A winning bid will speed up plans for a 5 billion-dirham\nexpansion of the city\u2019s metro network, Dubai\u2019s Roads and\nTransport Authority said in June. A new purpose-built exhibition\ncenter with themed pavilions will be constructed in the desert\nsouth of the city, according to Dubai\u2019s bid website.  Failure may bring a temporary halt to yield declines,\naccording Montasser Khelifi, a Dubai-based senior manager for\nglobal markets at Quantum Investment Bank Ltd. Even if it wins,\nexpenses, combined with about $42 billion of debt coming due in\nthe next two years, could put pressure on Dubai\u2019s borrowing\ncosts, Jean-Michel Saliba, an economist at BofA in  London , said\nin a note to clients on Sept. 26.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t win, as with every piece of bad news, there\nmay be a few days where we see a negative impact,\u201d Khelifi said\nby phone Oct. 24. \u201cBut it will not affect the fundamentals,\nbecause Dubai is still growing with a solid and diversified\neconomy.\u201d  Recovery Continues  Property prices in Dubai, one of the seven United Arab\nEmirates, have recovered by about a third since reaching a\nbottom in 2011, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., after the\n2008 crash. Nakheel wrote down its real estate by $21.4 billion\nfrom 2008 to mid-2010 and received an $8.6 billion bailout from\nDubai\u2019s government, helping it avoid default.  Emaar\u2019s third-quarter profit climbed 50 percent to 581\nmillion dirhams, the company said in a statement last week. The\noperator of the Dubai Mall, the world\u2019s largest by area, will be\namong the biggest winners if the sheikhdom hosts the Expo, first\nas land values and construction increase and then as hotel and\nretail businesses expand, HSBC said.  \u201cDubai\u2019s reputation will grow and the city will become\nmore attractive to investors and expatriates,\u201d Khelifi said.
