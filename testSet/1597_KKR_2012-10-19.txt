 "context": "The following article called 'Mack Starts Fund-of-Funds With Investor for Magic Johnson' was published on 2012-10-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJohn Mack , the former head of Morgan\nStanley, is going into business with a 77-year-old tax lawyer\nwho oversees more than $15 billion in investment assets for\nclients such as ex-basketball star  Magic Johnson  and the\nfounding family of Estee Lauder Cos.  Joel Ehrenkranz, who co-founded a tax and estate legal\npractice with his brother Sanford in 1966, joined forces with\nMack to start fund-of-funds manager E&M Advisors LLC, according\nto a  registration  filing last month with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission. E&M expects to raise $500 million this\nquarter to invest in outside  hedge funds  and private-equity\ndeals, the firm said in the filing.  Mack, a onetime bond salesman and trader, could help E&M\nAdvisors attract assets from corporate executives and private-\nbanking contacts cultivated during the course of his 35-year\ncareer at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , said Brad Hintz, a bank and brokerage\nanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Since leaving as Morgan\nStanley\u2019s chairman at the end of last year, Mack has become an\nadviser to companies including buyout firm KKR & Co., where he\nsigned on in March.  \u201cJohn\u2019s Rolodex would be mammoth,\u201d said Hintz, who worked\nfor Morgan Stanley from 1986 to 1996 as a managing director and\ntreasurer. \u201cThe classic model of Goldman Sachs and Morgan\nStanley was you had the relationship with the company and the\nexecutive.\u201d  Daniel Schloendorn, a partner at the  law firm  Willkie Farr\n& Gallagher LLP who represents Ehrenkranz, said his client\ndeclined to comment. Mack said in a brief interview that he had\nsimply lent his name to the venture.  \u201cWe have no plans,\u201d Mack said. \u201cI\u2019ve just known Joel for\na long time.\u201d  Brief Stint  Mack, who developed a reputation over the years for cutting\ncosts, not only ran Morgan Stanley and  Credit Suisse First\nBoston  at separate points, but also did a brief stint in 2005 as\nthe chairman of what was once the world\u2019s largest hedge fund. In\nJune of that year, he joined  Arthur Samberg \u2019s Pequot Capital\nManagement Inc., based in Westport, Connecticut-based, before\ngoing back to Morgan Stanley at the end of the month as chairman\nand chief executive officer.  After exiting the New York-based bank last December, the\nWall Street veteran set up John Mack Advisors LLC, according to\nDelaware state records. E&M Advisors was incorporated two months\nlater, with John Mack Advisors and Ehrenkranz\u2019s E&E Capital\nAdvisors LLC both holding 50 percent stakes, according to the\nSeptember filing.  E&M Advisors said in the regulatory filing that its first\nfund-of-funds will allocate assets to third-party money managers\nwho \u201cutilize a broad range of investment strategies,\u201d and may\nalso make direct investments in operating companies as well as\nco-investments with private-equity funds.  Fund Fees  When allocating money to hedge funds, Mack and Ehrenkranz\nplan to charge their investors an annual management fee equaling\n1.5 percent of net asset value, while taking a fee equaling as\nmuch as 2.5 percent of the cost of each private-equity deal. The\nfund of funds will also charge performance-based fees equaling 5\npercent to 25 percent of profits, depending on investment type,\naccording to the  SEC filing .  John Ehrenkranz, Joel\u2019s 47-year-old son, worked as a\nmanaging director at Morgan Stanley Capital Partners, the\nbrokerage\u2019s merchant-banking division, from 1996 until 2004,\nwhen he joined his father\u2019s investment-management business,\naccording to regulatory filings. The elder Ehrenkranz is active\nin the same  New York  philanthropic circles as Mack, serving as a\ntrustee at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of\n Modern Art , the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the  New York\nUniversity School of Law .  Lauder Family  Joel and his brother Sanford, 73, started a tax and estate\nplanning legal practice 46 years ago that catered to high-net-\nworth individuals, such as the Lauder family, SEC  filings show .\nAccording to court documents, Joel was an executor for the\nestate of Alan Tishman, the real estate developer who \u201chelped\ntransform New York\u2019s skyline,\u201d according to the New York Times.  The law firm began managing money for its clients,\ninitially by having them invest in commercial real estate\npartnerships and then in hedge funds, said a person familiar\nwith the firm who requested anonymity because of confidentiality\nagreements. In a 2004 civil trial tied to his former role as the\npresident of Walt Disney Co.,  Michael Ovitz  testified that Joel\nEhrenkranz was one of his two principal money managers and had\nalso been one of his main tax advisers from 1990 to 1995,\naccording to court transcripts.  Early Entrant  Ehrenkranz\u2019s fund of funds \u201cwas one of the earliest ones\nthat was ever started, well before a number of the big guys like\nMerrill Lynch and BlackRock\u201d got into the business, said Julian\nRundle, the chief investment officer of Dorset Management LLC, a\nNew York-based firm that creates customized portfolios of hedge\nfunds for clients.  In 2000, an Ehrenkranz money-management unit called E&E\nAdvisors LP registered with the SEC to provide investment\nadvisory services for high-net-worth individuals, including\nclients of the family law firm. Ehrenkranz legal clients can pay\ntheir retainers to the law firm by having the money deducted\nfrom accounts tied to their investments in E&E Advisors funds,\naccording to regulatory filings.  E&E Advisors has about $11.4 billion in assets under\nmanagement, including $10.8 billion in separate accounts and\n$583 million in funds of funds, according to regulatory  filings .\nA second Ehrenkranz investment advisory unit called E Capital\nManagement LP had about $3.7 billion invested in its funds of\nfunds at the end of January.  A spokeswoman for Magic Johnson, the former point guard for\nthe  National Basketball Association \u2019s  Los Angeles Lakers  who is\nenshrined in the Hall of fame, confirmed that he is an investor\nin one of Ehrenkranz\u2019s funds. The family office of  Donald\nMarron , the former chairman of the New York brokerage Paine\nWebber Group Inc., has about $52 million invested with the E&E\nAdvisors through an entity called Chestnut Partners LP, filings\nshow.
