 "context": "The following article called 'BlackBerry Breakup Looms as Investors Lose Faith in Buyout' was published on 2013-10-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBlackBerry (BBRY)  Ltd. is more open to a breakup of the company amid concerns that  Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH)  may be unable to line up funding or partners for a $4.7 billion buyout, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  Companies such as  SAP AG (SAP) ,  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which were approached last week by BlackBerry advisers, have indicated they\u2019re only interested in parts of the company, people familiar with the discussions said. A breakup would let parties bid for BlackBerry\u2019s most valuable pieces, such as its patents or enterprise network, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private.  \u201cIf you break up the company, you\u2019re going to get more than the company is worth right now,\u201d said  Sachin Shah , a strategist in special situations and merger arbitrage at New York-based Albert Fried & Co. Whether Fairfax\u2019s bid is successful or not, \u201cbreaking it up sounds more appetizing for all involved,\u201d he said.  BlackBerry has been soliciting rival bids after agreeing last month to a tentative $4.7 billion offer from Fairfax, its largest shareholder. Under that pact, BlackBerry has until Nov. 4 to consider other proposals while Fairfax and a group of investors conduct due diligence and line up financing. Investors have grown increasingly concerned the current deal will fall apart, with the  stock trading  10 percent below Fairfax\u2019s $9-a-share offer.  Losing Ground  The smartphone maker was pushed to consider selling itself after years of losing market share to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhone and devices powered by  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s Android. Even as BlackBerry\u2019s smartphones lose favor with consumers, its corporate services and patents could prove more enticing. The patents alone are worth as much as $3 billion, according to analyst estimates.  For now, the only public offer for BlackBerry is from Fairfax. The investment firm\u2019s chief executive officer,  Prem Watsa , stepped down from BlackBerry\u2019s board in August in order to put together his bid. Watsa hasn\u2019t named any of the other members in his buyout consortium, and while the group is seeking funding from  Bank of America Corp.  and BMO Capital Markets, no financing deal has been announced.  Alberta Investment Management Corp. and  Canada  Pension Plan Investment Board, two of Canada\u2019s largest pension funds, have both said they would consider joining a bid for BlackBerry, though neither has committed to the idea.  SAP, Cisco  Seeking to spark a bidding war for the smartphone maker, BlackBerry\u2019s advisers have been reaching out to its technology partners to gauge interest, the people said. SAP, Cisco and Samsung aren\u2019t interested in making an offer for the whole company, though they may consider individual parts, they said.  SAP is evaluating whether parts of BlackBerry, including its enterprise business, may be attractive, one of the people said. The enterprise division securely manages fleets of smartphones, including BlackBerrys, for business customers.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  doesn\u2019t want to bid for all or part of the company, though it wouldn\u2019t rule out evaluating the company\u2019s patents, said a person familiar with the chipmaker\u2019s thinking.  Jim Dever, a spokesman for Walldorf, Germany-based SAP, declined to comment, as did Cisco\u2019s John Earnhardt and Intel\u2019s Robert Manetta. Chenny Kim, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said her company has ruled out a bid for all of BlackBerry.  BlackBerry\u2019s complete portfolio of smartphone and wireless network patents is worth about $1.6 billion, according to Steven Li, an analyst at  Raymond James Financial (RJF)  in Toronto. Christopher Marlett, CEO of MDB Capital Group, a patent-focused investment bank, estimates the portfolio could fetch $2 billion to $3 billion.  Enterprise Business  The enterprise network, meanwhile, could be worth $550 million to $1.1 billion, said Li, who rates BlackBerry the equivalent of a hold. Its value may depend in part on how quickly BlackBerry\u2019s subscriber base declines. The company\u2019s customer base slipped to 72 million in June from 76 million in March. Since then, BlackBerry has stopped disclosing a number.  The phones themselves are unprofitable and a buyer may just shut down that business, so that operation isn\u2019t considered an asset, Li said.  BlackBerry\u2019s biggest asset may be its cash, which it had $2.6 billion of at the end of August.  Reuters  reported last week  that a number of technology companies, including Cisco, Google, Intel and SAP, were in talks with Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry about a sale.  Shares Gain  Speculation that a rival bid may emerge has helped drive up the stock more than 5 percent in the past three days. Still, through yesterday it was down 32 percent this year and had fallen about 95 percent from its 2008 peak. The shares fell 1.8 percent to $7.97 at 10:02 a.m. in New York.  BlackBerry\u2019s latest outreach follows earlier attempts to find buyers. Before announcing in August that it was formally considering takeover bids, the company\u2019s bankers spent almost a year canvassing potential acquirers, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  RBC Capital Markets  quietly contacted would-be bidders and found little interest in the whole company, especially among private-equity firms, the people said.  Paul Rivett , president of Toronto-based Fairfax, declined to comment on the sale process yesterday.  Lisette Kwong, a spokeswoman at BlackBerry, said the company\u2019s board is working with independent financial and legal advisers to conduct \u201ca robust and thorough review\u201d of its strategic options. \u201cWe do not intend to disclose further developments with respect to the process until we approve a specific transaction or otherwise conclude the review of strategic alternatives,\u201d she said.  Leo de Bever, the CEO of Alberta Investment, said this week that the bidding process has been unusual and that BlackBerry will probably be broken up.  \u201cIt\u2019s the most bizarre sales process I\u2019ve seen in a long time,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it, but nobody\u2019s come to us with a proposal that makes any sense.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story: Hugo Miller in Toronto at  hugomiller@bloomberg.net ; Jeffrey McCracken in  New York  at  jmccracken3@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: David Scanlan at  dscanlan@bloomberg.net ; Nick Turner at  nturner7@bloomberg.net ; Pui-Wing Tam at  ptam13@bloomberg.net ; Jeffrey McCracken at  jmccracken3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Intel Corporation was 17.944915771484375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Intel Corporation was ",
