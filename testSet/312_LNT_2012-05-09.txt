 "context": "The following article called 'Smart-Meter Defiance Slows $29 Billion U.S. Grid Upgrade' was published on 2012-05-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA growing consumer backlash against\nnew wireless digital technology for measuring power usage is\nslowing U.S. utilities\u2019 $29 billion effort to upgrade their\nnetworks.  States including California,  Maine  and Vermont have\nresponded to customer concerns about higher bills and safety by\noffering them the option of keeping their conventional devices\nfor an extra charge.  The fee may discourage drop-outs from the \u201csmart-meter\u201d\nprogram, in which household usage data is transmitted over radio\nwaves to local utilities such as  PG&E Corp. (PCG) , Central Maine Power\nCo. and  Central Vermont Public Service Corp. (CV) , which can use the\ninformation to charge higher rates during times of peak demand.  \u201cCharging fees for opting out is pretty outrageous,\u201d\nCharles Acquard, executive director of National Association of\nState Utility Consumer Advocates, which represents 44 consumer\ngroups in 40 states, said by telephone.  Escalating consumer opposition is delaying efforts to\ndeliver power more efficiently because the gadgets anchor next-\ngeneration transmission grids. Several utilities, including one\nowned by  Warren Buffett \u2019s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , are holding\noff on roll-out plans until regulators decide whether they can\nforce consumers to pay costs for the technology that utilities\nalso refuse to pick up.  Smart meters, so called because they allow real-time usage\nmonitoring, originally were pitched by the industry as a boon to\nconsumers for increasing control over consumption. While the\neffort won grants from the Obama administration, consumer\nadvocates say benefits have yet to materialize as promised.  Rising Opposition  A minority of customers complained the devices instead\nraise their bills, compromise privacy and risk their health with\nelectro-magnetic fields emitted by the wireless technology. In\nCalifornia, more than 50 local governments are opposing use of\nthe smart meters, according to Joshua Hart, director of Stop\nSmart Meters, a  Santa Cruz  County-based consumer group.  At the behest of state regulators, utilities such as San\nFrancisco-based PG&E and Edison International of Rosemead,\n California , plan to use the meters to offer plans that would\ncharge higher rates during peak usage-times such as summer heat\nwaves or winter storms. The devices also promise to save\nutilities money by eliminating meter readers, shortening\nresponse times to power failures, and allowing for remote\nswitching when turning service on or off.  While the companies anticipate cost savings, they\u2019ve pushed\nfor the expense of buying and installing the new meters to be\npassed on through customer bills.  Holding Off Deployment  The meters are key to the \u201csmart grid\u201d being rolled out\nnationwide to increase delivery flexibility. Investment by\nutilities in the new grid has totaled $15.4 billion through the\nfirst quarter of 2012 and is projected to increase by another\n$13.4 billion through 2015, said Theodore Hesser, an analyst for\nBloomberg New Energy Finance.  Not all companies are plowing ahead. In November,\nMidAmerican Energy Co., a utility owned by Buffett\u2019s Berkshire\nHathaway, told Iowa regulators it was waiting to deploy electric\nsmart meters while it assesses how other power companies address\ncomplaints.  Alliant Energy Corp. (LNT) \u2019s Iowa utility told state regulators\nthat concerns about raising customer bills and rapidly changing\ntechnology were among the reasons keeping it on the sidelines.  Last fall,  Connecticut  delayed its decision on  Northeast\nUtilities (NU) \u2019 proposal to install 1.2 million smart meters, saying\nit needed time to establish a state policy on the technology.  How Consumers Benefit  Even if a minority of customers keeps their old meters,\nPG&E still will be able to realize savings from the upgrade,\nsaid Helen Burt, PG&E senior vice president and chief customer\nofficer.  PG&E \u201cwants to accommodate\u201d residents who don\u2019t want a\nwireless meter and is reaching out to inform residents about the\nbenefits of tracking energy use on its website and signing up\nfor energy conservation programs, Burt said.  Edison International (EIX) \u2019s Southern California Edison, the\nstate\u2019s second-largest utility, said about 28,000 customers have\nasked for a delay of a smart meter installation out of 4.9\nmillion customers, said Ken Devore, director of the utility\u2019s\nsmart grid program.  That will not interfere with its program that can offer\nbenefits such as tracking and saving on energy use, he said.\n\u201cThese are safe, secure and high quality devices,\u201d he said.  Allowing Meter Choice  An increasing number of states are moving to motivate\nconsumers to go along by permitting utilities to charge those\nwho refuse the meters to pay an extra monthly fee. State\nregulators see \u201csmart\u201d technology as a way of reducing power\nconsumption during periods of peak demand, reducing the need to\nbuild expensive  power plants  and easing the potential for black-\nouts from capacity that can\u2019t keep up with urban growth.  Nine U.S. states including Texas and  Michigan  are either\nconsidering allowing customers to decline a smart meter or are\nallowing for that option, according to state regulatory filings\nand an April 2012 report from the Edison Electric Institute, a\nWashington-based industry lobbying group.  In  Vermont , the legislature passed a bill on May 4 that\nwould eliminate a fee utilities may now charge to customers who\nrefuse a wireless smart meter, according to Aaron Adler, counsel\nwith the Vermont Legislative Council. The bill still needs the\ngovernor\u2019s signature to become law.  In California, most customers will have to pay an initial\nfee of $75 and then a monthly charge of $10 to keep their\ntraditional meter. At PG&E, fees could hike monthly power bills\non average by about 12 percent, based on an average bill of $84,\nsaid Greg Snapper, a PG&E spokesman.  About 26,800 PG&E customers out of 5.4 million have decided\nto keep their mechanical meters, Snapper said in an e-mail.  More Accurate Measurement  More than 90 percent of PG&E customers now have a smart\nmeter as part of a more than $2.2 billion program to deploy at\nleast 9.7 million wireless electric and gas units, Burt said.  The utility\u2019s roll-out of the devices, which started in\n2006, has been fraught with complications including customer\naccusations that the smart meters were overcharging. In 2010,\nstate regulators commissioned a study that found the\nmeasurements were reliable. Burt of PG&E said the devices are\nmore accurate than traditional analog meters.  Regulators and utilities also point to government studies\nthat say the devices are safe. In 2011, the California Council\non Science and Technology, a state-created technology advisory\nboard, said in a report it found no evidence from scientific\nstudies that smart meters were harmful and the devices emit far\nless radio-frequency energy than microwaves or mobile phones.  Meeting Safety Guidelines  Smart meters must meet Federal Communications Commission\nguidelines on emission levels and those that meet the standards\nand are installed properly are safe, agency spokesman Neil Grace\nsaid.  California regulators have approved smart meter programs\nand decided households that don\u2019t want a wireless unit should\npay for the costs of continuing to use their old devices, said\nTerrie Prosper, a spokeswoman for the California Public\nUtilities Commission.  Utilities, which back the state-imposed fees, say charging\nconsumers for keeping their old mechanical meters will pay for\nthe workers dispatched to homes and businesses each month to\nrecord usage by hand, the old-fashioned way.  About 27 million smart meters have been installed as of\nSeptember 2011, according to the Institute for Electric\nEfficiency, a Washington-based research group financed by\ninvestor-owned utilities. By 2015, about 65 million, or about\nhalf, of U.S. homes will have a wireless meter, according to the\ngroup.  \u2018Model for Broadband\u2019  Those opposed to the state-driven mandates say forcing\ncustomers to use smart meters is like making someone pay to have\na high-speed Internet connection.  \u201cWe kind of like the model for broadband, where nobody is\nforced to take it, but people see the value in it and are\nwilling to pay more for it,\u201d said Mark Toney, executive\ndirector of the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based\nconsumer advocacy group.  Catharine Gunderson, 59, a retired teacher, said she\ninstalled a cage around her traditional meter on her home in\nSanta Cruz, California, to prevent PG&E from swapping them for a\nwireless unit.  \u201cI feel like it\u2019s extortion,\u201d Gunderson said about the\nopt-out fees. Gunderson said she\u2019s concerned about the health\neffects of smart meters and recently paid to keep her\ntraditional meter.
