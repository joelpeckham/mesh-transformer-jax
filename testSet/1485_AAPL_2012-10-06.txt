The  S&P 500  reversed a rally in the week\u2019s final session,\nas  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slumped and optimism over the government\u2019s monthly\njobs report faded.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) \nadded more than 5.5 percent during the week.  MetroPCS (PCS) \nCommunications Inc. climbed 8 percent as Deutsche Telekom AG\nagreed to combine its T-Mobile USA unit with the company.\n Netflix Inc.

The S&P 500 added 1.4 percent to 1,460.93, after slumping\n1.7 percent in the previous  two weeks . The Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage climbed 173.02 points, or 1.3 percent, to 13,610.15. The\n30-stock gauge rose to the highest level since December 2007.  \u201cThe trajectory is positive,\u201d said  Quincy Krosby , a\nmarket strategist for Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential\nFinancial Inc., which oversees $961 billion. \u201cWe\u2019ve had\neconomic numbers that are better. We\u2019ve had more reinforcement\nthat the ECB stands ready to buy bonds. As we get into the\nearnings season, corporate guidance is going to be crucial.\u201d  Equities rebounded from the biggest weekly drop since June\non better-than-forecast factory orders and manufacturing data.\nThe unemployment rate in the U.S. unexpectedly fell to 7.8\npercent in September, the lowest since President Barack Obama\ntook office in January 2009. ECB President Mario Draghi said the\ncentral bank is ready to undertake bond purchases \u201conce all the\nprerequisites are in place.\u201d  Earnings Season  Investors will be able to gauge the health of U.S.\ncorporations as  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  unofficially starts the earnings\nseason with the release of its third-quarter numbers on Oct. 9.\nThe streak of 11 quarters of profit growth in S&P 500 companies\nis projected to end as analysts estimate a decline of 1.7\npercent in earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cThe earnings season is critical on two points,\u201d said\n Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management\nin Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $47 billion. He\nspoke in a phone interview. \u201cThe first is: how much has the\nglobal slowdown impacted earnings? The next thing I expect\nearnings to do is give us guidance on 2013.\u201d  Better-than-estimated  earnings  and speculation on central\nbank stimulus action have helped drive a 14 percent gain in the\nS&P 500 since June 1. The rally put the index close to its all-\ntime high of 1,565.15 set in October 2007. The S&P 500 needs to\nrise 7.1 percent to reach that level.  Economic Optimism  Bets that the economic recovery won\u2019t be derailed took the\nMorgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to growth\nup 2.3 percent for the week. Nine out of  10 groups  in the  S&P\n500 (SPX)  rose as financial companies had the biggest gain. The  KBW\nBank Index (BKX)  jumped 3.7 percent. Citigroup increased 6.3 percent\nto $34.77.

The company has\ngrappled with customer-satisfaction issues since increasing\nprices in 2011 for users who both stream videos and get DVDs by\nmail and an attempt that year to separate those offerings. A\nCitigroup survey last month found that 48 percent of customers\nare \u201cvery or extremely satisfied,\u201d compared with about 45\npercent in the first and second quarter.  \u2018Evaluating Opportunities\u2019  Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR)  climbed 8.9 percent to $58.45.

The problem with transparency\nis when they open up the full picture, it\u2019s pretty ugly.\u201d  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG)  slumped 12 percent to $280.93\nafter hedge fund manager  David Einhorn  recommended selling the\nstock short during a presentation. Einhorn, head of Greenlight\nCapital Inc., said that Chipotle has too high of a valuation and\nwill face challenges from  Yum! Brands Inc.\u2019s (YUM)  Taco Bell chain.
