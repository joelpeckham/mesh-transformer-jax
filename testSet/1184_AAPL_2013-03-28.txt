 "context": "The following article called 'Former Trader\u2019s Software Skips Visa in Battle With Google' was published on 2013-03-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMerchants paid an estimated $600\nbillion last year to let their customers use plastic to shop.\nNow, some stores are turning to a Swedish company that says it\ncan slash those credit and debit card fees in half.  Those fees to banks and payment network companies such as\n Visa Inc. (V)  and  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  eat into profits that could have\ngone to lower prices for customers, said  Seamless Distribution\nAB (SEAM)  Chief Executive Officer Peter Fredell. While other apps let\nsmartphone users pay without wallets, Seamless\u2019s SEQR is the\nonly one that saves merchants money with no investment, he said.  \u201cThis is huge, especially when many of these merchants\nhave an operating margin of 1 percent,\u201d Fredell said over lunch\nfrom his office overlooking a construction site on the outskirts\nof  Stockholm .  Seamless cut its teeth on the streets of cities such as\nAccra, Riga and Mumbai, where its software lets mobile users top\nup their pre-paid cards without a modern banking infrastructure.\nAfter 12 years, the company is harnessing the booming use of\nsmartphones to promise savings to merchants because it can route\npayments directly to and from bank accounts, dodging traditional\ncard-handling fees.  Seamless struck a deal with McDonald Corp.\u2019s restaurants in\n Sweden  on March 5 and one with grocer  Axfood AB (AXFO) , with annual\nsales of 36.3 billion kronor ($5.6 billion), in October.\nFredell, a former derivatives trader, said he\u2019s signing a\nhandful of new contracts each day and plans to expand to other\nEuropean markets soon. His business idea is to split the global\naverage of 1.89 percent in card fees 50-50 with shopkeepers.  Personal PIN  Say a shopper wants to buy groceries. A cashier scans the\nitems, rings up the total and beams the information to Seamless\nthrough a switch already built into many registers. The customer\nsnaps a picture of the unique QR code on the machine, beams up\nand Seamless software matches the seller to the buyer in the\ncloud. The shopper gets a message to approve the purchase,\ncompletes the deal with a personal PIN and then gets a receipt,\nall within seconds.  \u201cPeople have been so focused on the exchange of info\nhappening at the store,\u201d Fredell said. \u201cWe took it the other\nway, running the transaction backwards.\u201d  Steep Fees  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s mobile-wallet solution lets consumers pay for\ngoods in stores by tapping a smartphone on a device. People\ntalking about mobile payments dwell on the use of near-field\ncommunications, or NFC, as the best way to transfer money from\nthe buyer to seller, Fredell said, adding he initially passed on\nNFC after considering the security risk of having bank data\n\u201cfloating through the air.\u201d  Seamless\u2019s technology is already integrated into more than\nhalf a million points of sales globally thanks to the company\u2019s\nroots in mobile top-ups, where it conducted more than 3 billion\ntransactions last year. The big problem with Google Inc.\u2019s\nmobile payments app is that it\u2019s still a card transaction where\nmerchants face the steep fees, Fredell said.  \u201cThere\u2019s no business case to install NFC readers, to make\ninvestments if there\u2019s no profit,\u201d Fredell said. \u201cWhy connect\nthrough the Visa or MasterCard switch, why not just connect\ndirectly to the banking system.\u201d  The SEQR app is available on  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhone and on\ndevices running Google\u2019s Android software.  Representatives for Visa and MasterCard couldn\u2019t\nimmediately be reached in  Europe .  Strong Response  The company made a loss of 24.8 million kronor last year\nwhile sales more than doubled to 134 million kronor as it sunk\nincome from its traditional top-up business into development of\nSEQR. So far, the response from retailers has been strong,\nFredell said. Seamless hands out unique QR identifiers, the\nshops flip a switch on their cash register and the system is up\nand running.  \u201cWe\u2019re doing this because it should save us money and\ncustomers want this for the future,\u201d said Anders Quist, head of\nbusiness development at Axfood in Stockholm. \u201cThis gives us\nlower transaction costs, allowing us to be more efficient, which\nis important in a low-margin business like ours.\u201d  Seamless, which is traded on Stockholm\u2019s OMX Nasdaq\nexchange, raised 102.4 million kronor after selling new shares\nearlier this year to use for expansion.  Investment AB Kinnevik (KINVA) ,\nwhich owns 24.2 percent of  Germany \u2019s Rocket Internet, is the\nsecond-biggest owner with 11.8 percent after Fredell, who has\n16.1 percent. The share sale gives Seamless the funding it needs\nto continue with its expansion plans, Fredell said.  Beyond Physical  The shares were unchanged at 23.30 kronor at the early 1\np.m. close in Stockholm with trading volume less than 20 percent\nthe three-month daily average. The stock is up  40 percent  this\nyear, compared with a 8.7 percent gain for Stockholm\u2019s  OMX\nIndex. (OMX)   Seamless is already looking beyond physical shopping, the\nCEO said. The system works just as well for online purchases\nwhere a website generates a SEQR code for each purchase and\ncould be used in direct advertising, in magazines or even in\ntelevision commercials, which would help retailers better focus\nad spending.  \u201cBecause we can save merchants money, they can let that\ntrickle down in the form of offers to consumers,\u201d Fredell said.\n\u201cIt becomes a symbiosis.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAdam Ewing in Stockholm at \n aewing5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Kenneth Wong  at \n kwong11@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 14.04709243774414 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
