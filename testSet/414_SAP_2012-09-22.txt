 "context": "The following article called 'Merkel, Hollande EU Unity Pledge Fails to Stretch to Bank Union' was published on 2012-09-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChancellor Angela Merkel  and\nPresident  Francois Hollande \u2019s appeal for German-French unity to\ntackle  Europe \u2019s ills lasted all of three hours as they disagreed\nover closer integration of the region\u2019s banking system.  The two leaders, marking Franco-German reconciliation after\nWorld War II, delivered back-to-back speeches in which they\nhailed their mutual ties, tried out each other\u2019s language and\npledged to work together for a more unified Europe to defeat the\nfinancial crisis. The bonhomie broke down at a subsequent press\nconference when they failed to mask their differences on a\nplanned \u201cbanking union\u201d meant to achieve that end.  \u201cThe earlier, the better,\u201d Hollande told reporters in the\nGerman town of Asperg yesterday, saying that banking union is\n\u201can important step in our targets\u201d with a goal of\nimplementation by year\u2019s end. Merkel, standing alongside,\ndeclined to set a target date, saying there\u2019s no point doing\nsomething fast if it then doesn\u2019t work.  The disagreement was the only point of public discord\nduring an occasion meant to stress the Franco-German alliance\nthat Hollande said was \u201cthe heart of Europe\u201d leading the fight\nagainst the debt crisis in the 17-nation euro area. For all the\nentente, the leaders of Europe\u2019s two biggest economies remain at\nodds on the pace of banking union and on whether  Spain  should\nseek a sovereign bailout, plus the conditions that would apply.  Schaeuble Criticism  German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  led criticism of\nthe euro region\u2019s rush toward common bank oversight at a meeting\nof European Union finance ministers in Cyprus this month.\nGermany has raised doubts about plans backed by  France , Spain\nand  Italy  to hand the European Central Bank oversight powers\nover all banks in the euro area, and to do so by Jan. 1.  Financial markets \u201cthat are watching Europe want to see\nresults\u201d on banking union, Merkel said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we say it\nhas to be thorough, the quality has to be good and then we\u2019ll\nsee how long it takes.\u201d At the same time, the goal is to \u201cwork\nas quickly as possible.\u201d  With decisions looming on  Greece \u2019s progress in meeting aid\ntargets, the sustainability of Spain\u2019s finances and the\nmechanics of pressing for closer European integration, Merkel\nand Hollande are making efforts to get to grips with their\ndiffering political outlooks. The two have struggled to find\ncommon ground after Hollande won election in May on a platform\nof opposition to her austerity-first solution to the debt crisis\nand she publicly backed his opponent,  Nicolas Sarkozy .  EADS-BAe Questions  The German and French leaders agreed to press ahead with\ntheir governments\u2019 review of the planned merger of European\nAeronautic, Defence & Space Co. and BAE Systems Plc. Hollande\nsaid that \u201cquestions and verifications\u201d will be conducted in\nthe coming days. \u201cJobs, industrial strategy, defense, interests\nof both our countries are at stake,\u201d he said.  In his earlier speech, Hollande appealed to Merkel to join\nwith France in pushing for closer European union, saying Europe\nis on the verge of a \u201cnew frontier\u201d that can only be crossed\nby moving toward fiscal, banking, social and political union.  \u201cWe must act together or we risk being swept away in each\nof our nations, by skepticism, selfishness and populism,\u201d\nHollande said at the 18th-century Ludwigsburg castle outside the\ncity of Stuttgart.  Charles de Gaulle  The ceremony marked 50 years since a 1962 speech to German\nyouth at the same location by then French President  Charles de Gaulle , the wartime leader who liberated France from Nazi German\noccupation and founded the country\u2019s Fifth Republic. The chateau\nwas the residence of the dukes of Wuerttemberg, a region that is\nnow part of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the state that is home to world-\nbeating German companies such as Porsche AG, Daimler AG and SAP.  In a sign of reconciliation after the third German-French\nwar since 1871, de Gaulle held his speech in German,\ncongratulating young Germans for being \u201cchildren of a great\npeople -- yes, a great people -- that has sometimes, during the\ncourse of its history, committed great mistakes.\u201d  Hollande and Merkel echoed De Gaulle\u2019s words and delivered\nsections of their respective speeches in the other\u2019s language,\nMerkel praising the assembled youth in French and Hollande\nstumbling over the German word for \u201cfriendship.\u201d  Germany  and France must nurture their ties, as \u201cgood and\ntrusting relations are not a given,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cWe are\nworking to make Europe sustainably healthy,\u201d she said.\n\u201cGermany and France have a special responsibility in that\nregard.\u201d  Hollande compared Germany and France to an elderly couple\nwho depend upon each other with a friendship that \u201csometimes\nloses its way\u201d yet is mutually \u201cessential.\u201d To appreciate how\nprecious the relationship is, \u201cwe have the duty to light up our\nflame every day.\u201d  Merkel, asked about her relationship with Hollande, said\nthey are \u201cfriendly.\u201d Hollande shrugged off a question about\nthe closeness between the German chancellor and his predecessor\nthat led to them being dubbed \u201cMerkozy.\u201d He refused to bless\nthe suggestion offered: \u201cMerkhollande.\u201d  \u201cWe don\u2019t need to put our surnames together to put a name\non European policies,\u201d Hollande said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nTony Czuczka in Ludwigsburg, Germany via \n aczuczka@bloomberg.net ;\nHelene Fouquet in Ludwigsburg, Germany via at \n hfouquet1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJames Hertling at   jhertling@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of SAP AG ADS was 63.52099609375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of SAP AG ADS was ",
