 "context": "The following article called 'Egypt\u2019s Savings Vacuum Shows Struggle for Banks: Islamic Finance' was published on 2012-10-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMurad Hassan, who owns a stationary\nshop in Cairo, doesn\u2019t keep his money in a bank, and says\nexpanding Shariah-compliant finance under Egypt\u2019s new Islamic\ngovernment won\u2019t change his mind.  The 43-year-old father of three rarely has more than $500\nin excess cash, which he uses to stock up on school supplies for\nhis store on a street lined with small family businesses in\nMatariya, a low- to medium-income neighborhood in northeast\nCairo. \u201cIt\u2019s never a large enough sum to consider doing more\nwith it,\u201d he said in an phone interview Oct. 21.  Hassan isn\u2019t the exception. Nine out of 10 adult Egyptians\ndon\u2019t have a bank account, the Middle East\u2019s lowest ratio apart\nfrom  Yemen , according to the  World Bank . The lack of clients\nunderscores the struggle Islamists face to promote Shariah-\ncompliant financing after last year\u2019s revolt propelled them to\npower. For Islamic banking to flourish in the majority Muslim\nnation, President Mohamed Mursi must lift economic growth from\n2011\u2019s 19-year low of 1.8 percent, Capital Economics Ltd. said.  Mursi, who became Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected\nleader in June, is preparing laws to increase the share of\nShariah-compliant deposits from 6 percent now, and enable\nborrowers to sell bonds complying with Islam\u2019s ban on interest.  The plans haven\u2019t yet jolted banks into action.  Commercial\nInternational Bank Egypt SAE (COMI) , the biggest publicly traded\nlender, is still \u201ctesting the waters\u201d on whether to tap\n Islamic finance , Mohamed El Toukhy, chief executive officer of\n consumer banking , said in an Oct. 9 interview in Dubai. Only 1\npercent of Egyptians with bank accounts have saved money in the\npast year, the World Bank said in an April report.  Little Savings  \u201cThe fact that saving ratios are low and that many\nEgyptians are poor bodes ill for both Islamic and conventional\nbanks,\u201d Said Hirsh, London-based economist at Capital Economics\nLtd., said in an e-mailed response to questions Oct. 22. \u201cThis\ncould change if the Egyptian economy were to grow at a faster\nrate in the future, around 7 percent a year, with more citizens\nsharing in this growth.\u201d  The last time the economy  expanded that fast  was in 2008,\nthe same year foreign direct investments rose to more than $13\nbillion. It will take until 2016 for growth to reach 6.5\npercent, according to International Monetary Fund  estimates .  The fall of autocratic rulers who long oppressed Islamists\nhas fueled speculation that governments and consumers will turn\nto Shariah-compliant finance. The ultra-orthodox Nour Party,\n Egypt \u2019s second-biggest Islamist group after the Muslim\nBrotherhood, seeks to eventually phase out the current banking\nsystem, replacing it with one that bans interest. Global Islamic\nfinancial assets will double by 2015 to as much as $3 trillion,\nStandard and Poor\u2019s said last month.  \u2018Exaggerated\u2019 Potential  \u201cLet\u2019s not give too much weight to the ravings about\nIslamic banking in Egypt,\u201d Abdul Hameed Abu Musa, governor of\nCairo-based  Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt , said in a phone\ninterview Oct. 22. He dismissed as \u201cexaggerated\u201d estimates by\ngroups such as the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Freedom and Justice\nParty that Islamic deposits and lending may expand six-fold in\nthe next five years.  Only three of the 39 banks operating in the most-populous\nArab country are fully Shariah compliant. Real credit growth to\nprivate businesses and consumers may shrink 5.9 percent this\nyear and 5.4 percent in 2013, according to HSBC Holdings Plc\nestimates. That compares with 4.3 percent 2012 growth in\n Tunisia , where a popular uprising broke out in December 2010\nthat set off a wave of political unrest across the  Middle East .  Deposits Growing  Still, Islamic deposits could almost double to 10 percent\nof the total by 2017 if the economy recovers, Abu Musa, 70,\nsaid. Funds managed by Faisal Islamic soared 16 percent, or\nabout 4 billion Egyptian pounds ($656 million), in the first\nnine months. Sixty percent of deposits range between 500 pounds\nto 30,000 pounds in size, he said.  The government is also confident a debut sukuk sale will be\nwell received once a law is passed and the nation secures a $4.8\nbillion loan from the IMF. Foreign banks have expressed interest\nto buy as much as $1 billion of the debt, Finance Ministry head\nof debt management, Samy Khallaf, said by e-mail Oct. 17. Global\nsukuk sales have surged almost 80 percent to a record $39\nbillion this year as borrowers benefit from record-low yields.  In the Arab world, only Qatar, Bahrain, as well as Dubai\nand Ras Al Khaimah in the  United Arab Emirates , have sold\nsovereign dollar-denominated Islamic debt, data compiled by\nBloomberg show.  Tapping the Unbanked  The yield on Dubai\u2019s 6.396 percent sukuk due November 2014\nplunged 295 basis points, or 2.95 percentage points, to 2.63\npercent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The\npremium investors demand to hold the sukuk over  Malaysia \u2019s\ninvestment-grade 3.928 percent notes maturing in June 2015\nplunged 165 basis points to 122.  Regional banks want to expand into Egypt to tap consumer\ndemand in the most-populous Arab country.  Qatar National Bank (QNBK)  is\nconducting due diligence for a potential acquisition of  Societe\nGenerale SA (GLE) \u2019s 77.2 percent stake in a local unit.  \u201cThe retail is a chance for everyone not just Islamic\nbanks,\u201d Emad Mostaque, London-based strategist at Religare\nHichens Harrison, said Oct. 15 by phone. \u201cBut now that you have\nan Islamic leadership, it\u2019s probably going to have a better\nchance than it would have otherwise.\u201d  Traditional Methods  It may be difficult to coax Egyptians to abandon\ntraditional savings methods in favor of banks. Wael Amin, a 37\nyear-old primary school Arabic teacher, keeps his extra cash at\nhome or buys gold with it, turned off by some Islamic scholars\nwho contend that banking involves reba, the Arabic term for\nusury, which is banned by the religion.  \u201cIslamic banks aren\u2019t much different in my opinion because\nthey are based on the same traditional banking models, so I stay\naway,\u201d he said in an interview Oct. 21 in Cairo.  Many Egyptians, including Amin and Hassan, use the informal\ninterest-free saving method known as a gama\u2019iya, under which a\nsmall group of people agree to contribute a fixed amount to a\ncollective pot at defined intervals, such as monthly. Each time,\none member collects the entire sum, which can be used to pay for\npurchases like furniture, cars or wedding jewelry.  This method of borrowing is useful for Egyptians who would\notherwise be unable to secure a loan from a bank. The economic\ncrisis has forced the  unemployment rate  up to 12.6 percent in\nthe first quarter, the highest since Bloomberg  started tracking\nthe data in 2003 . \u201cI keep waiting for the market to pick up,\u201d\nHassan said.  Faisal Islamic only lends to consumers as part of\nagreements with companies or trade unions because it is\nconcerned customers\u2019 won\u2019t be able to repay, said Abu Musa, a\nformer central bank board member. The bank has 30 branches in\nEgypt, compared with Commercial International Bank\u2019s 153\nbranches and HSBC\u2019s 100.  \u201cNext year, we will add between three to four branches,\u201d\nAbu Musa said. \u201cWe work in a society where for a long time it\nwas hard to operate as an Islamic bank. This has changed\ndramatically, but we have to be cautious.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAlaa Shahine in Dubai at \n asalha@bloomberg.net ;\nAhmed A.
