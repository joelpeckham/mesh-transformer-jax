 "context": "The following article called 'IPhone Frenzy Slows Growth for Prepaid Wireless Carriers' was published on 2012-04-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  and\n Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) , the two biggest prepaid\nmobile-phone carriers in the U.S., are watching the iPhone\u2019s\nbooming sales from the sidelines.  Apple Inc.\u2019s device -- the best-selling smartphone at  AT&T (T) \nInc.,  Verizon Wireless  and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  -- isn\u2019t\navailable from MetroPCS and Leap, which typically offer lower-\nend models to users who don\u2019t want monthly contracts.  Getting locked out of the iPhone market may be taking a\ntoll on prepaid carriers -- an area that\u2019s been one of fastest-\ngrowing parts of the mobile-phone industry, fueled by young\npeople and lower-income consumers wanting a phone without having\nto go through a credit check and other hassles. MetroPCS added\n82 percent fewer subscribers in the first quarter than a year\nearlier, while Leap drew 22 percent fewer.  \u201cWe are seeing the impact of the iPhone,\u201d said Avi\nGreengart, a research director at Washington-based Current\nAnalysis.  The first-quarter results of MetroPCS and Leap, both\nreleased in the past 24 hours, sent the stocks tumbling today in\nU.S. trading. Leap  dropped  20 percent to $6.14, the biggest\ndecline since August. MetroPCS decreased 11 percent at $7.08,\nalso the worst since August.  MetroPCS, based in Richardson,  Texas , netted about 132,000\nnew customers last quarter, missing a  Piper Jaffray Cos. (PJC) \nestimate of 350,000.  San Diego \u2019s Leap added 258,000.  Costly Promotions  In addition to the decelerating growth, the prepaid\ncarriers have had to step up promotional pricing and rebates,\ncrimping profit more than analysts had anticipated. In contrast,\nthe three carriers -- Verizon, AT&T and Sprint -- all topped\nanalysts\u2019 estimates, helped by iPhone sales.  The Apple device made up 78 percent of AT&T\u2019s smartphone\nsales in the first quarter. At Verizon, which added the iPhone\nto its network more recently, the product accounted for 51\npercent. The company relies more on models running Google Inc.\u2019s\nAndroid operating system.  Apple\u2019s profit almost doubled to $11.6 billion last\nquarter, lifted by the surging popularity of the iPhone, while\nrevenue jumped 59 percent to $39.2 billion. The company sold\n35.1 million iPhones in the period.  Prepaid carriers also face more direct competition from\ntraditional mobile-phone services. When it started, the MetroPCS\n$50 month-by-month unlimited service plan was an attractive\nalternative for consumers who didn\u2019t want to be locked in to\nmore expensive two-year contracts. Now those users can get\nsimilar prepaid plans from the top three carriers.  Smartphone Demand  The broader shift to smartphones also hasn\u2019t helped, said\nMark Winther, an analyst at research firm IDC in  New York . The\nnetworks of the prepaid carriers aren\u2019t as well suited to the\ndata downloading required by those devices, and that may be\npushing customers away, he said.  \u201cMetroPCS\u2019s high churn rate may be the smartphone users\ndisgruntled by bad performance, and going to another carrier,\u201d\nWinther said.  The promotional pricing, meanwhile, is hurting MetroPCS\u2019s\nprofit margins, Christopher Larsen, an analyst at Piper Jaffray,\nsaid in a report. The company\u2019s adjusted earnings before\ninterest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $262\nmillion, 23 percent below his projection.  The cost of adding new customers rose 50 percent at\nMetroPCS. A $30 mail-in rebate implemented in March and other\npromotions have ramped up those expenses, John Hodulik, an\nanalyst at UBS AG in New York, said in a research note.  Takeover Plan  Sprint considered  buying  MetroPCS, only to have its board\nvote down the acquisition, two people familiar with the plan\nsaid in February. The board decided the stock-and-cash\ntransaction, which may have cost as much as $8 billion including\ndebt, would have been too expensive given the current level of\nSprint\u2019s stock price.  The entire wireless industry is facing slowing growth as\nthe market becomes saturated. The number of wireless devices,\nincluding tablets, now exceeds the number of people in the U.S.,\nsaid Bob Roche, a statistician with the trade group CTIA.  That\u2019s forced the big carriers to fight harder for market\nshare, said  Current Analysis \u2019 Greengart. Smaller companies are\nincreasingly in their cross hairs, he said.  \u201cWith the big guys still growing in a saturated market,\nthe new customers have to be coming from somewhere,\u201d he said.
