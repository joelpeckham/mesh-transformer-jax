 "context": "The following article called 'Christie Scrapping Tunnel Brings $5 Billion Wage Loss, Threatens Montclair' was published on 2010-11-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGovernor  Chris Christie  cut off  New\nJersey  from $5 billion in New York-based salaries and diminished\nits future role in the world\u2019s second-largest regional economy,\naccording to government data and former state Commerce\nCommissioner  Gil Medina , by ending construction of a Hudson\nRiver  rail tunnel  he said taxpayers couldn\u2019t afford.  The first-term Republican canceled the $9.8 billion tunnel,\nthe country\u2019s largest federally supported infrastructure\nproject, on Oct. 27. New Jersey, which already faces a $10.5\nbillion budget deficit next year, couldn\u2019t accept a \u201cblank\ncheck\u201d on cost overruns that might exceed $5 billion, said\nChristie, 48.  Christie\u2019s move means  the state  will have to repay the U.S.\ngovernment $350 million already spent on the project, forgo $3\nbillion in additional federal aid and lose the 3,000\nconstruction-worker openings the tunnel was projected to\ngenerate for the next decade. Canceling the tunnel will also\ncost New York and New Jersey 44,000 jobs and $4 billion in\nadditional income that would have come through economic growth,\naccording to a 2008 study by New Jersey Transit.  \u201cThis tunnel project is vital to the long-term health of\nthe region and to New Jersey,\u201d Medina, executive managing\ndirector for real-estate firm Cushman & Wakefield, said in a\nNov. 1 telephone interview from his Secaucus office. \u201cWe have\nto allow for an efficient flow of people, goods and materials\nthrough the region.\u201d  Property Threat  New Jersey residents supported Christie\u2019s decision to kill\nthe tunnel 51 percent to 39 percent, according to a  Rutgers-\nEagleton poll  by New-Brunswick-based Eagleton Center for Public\nInterest Polling of 885 registered voters. The survey was\ncarried out after Christie said Oct. 7 he would halt project\nfunding. Among New York commuters, 52 percent said they\ndisagreed with the decision, according to the poll.  The most direct impact from the cancellation will be felt\nby homeowners near rail lines who would have gained swifter\naccess to Manhattan, said Sean Maher, associate economist at\nWest Chester, Pennsylvania-based Moody\u2019s Analytics.  \u201cThat\u2019s one of the main sources of demand for real estate\nin northern New Jersey, as a bedroom community,\u201d Maher said.\n\u201cThat will most likely slow the area\u2019s population growth even\nfurther -- and it\u2019s already slow. It also reduces property\nvalues.\u201d  Home prices in communities such as  Montclair  that are\nserved by New Jersey Transit rail lines offering direct access\nto Manhattan\u2019s Penn Station rose an average of 6 percent last\nyear, said Jeffrey Otteau, president of the Otteau Valuation\nGroup Inc. in East Brunswick. The increase came even as real-\nestate prices statewide declined by 2 percent, he said.  $18 Billion Increase  The Regional Plan Association, a New York research group\nthat supported the tunnel, said home values within 2 miles (3.2\nkilometers) of train stations on lines running into the project\nwould have increased by $18 billion, generating $375 million in\nadditional property-tax collections each year.  \u201cRail access increases demand and it increases prices,\u201d\nOtteau said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf you build this\nproject, it\u2019s reasonable those communities expand.\u201d  About 373,000 New Jersey residents already earn paychecks\nin New York, according to the  New York State Department of\nTaxation and Finance . The typical New Jersey commuter was paid\n$205,000 in 2007, the last year for which New York has\nstatistics.  In-State Growth  Christie told reporters today in Trenton that he\u2019s\nreceiving more inquiries from businesses in other states\nexpressing interest in coming to New Jersey since he closed a\ndeficit of $10.7 billion without raising taxes. He said he\u2019s\nhopeful about an economic recovery and thinks the state is\nbetter off trying to create its own jobs.  The economic forecast for the tunnel amounted to \u201ca\nspeculative number of jobs based upon the premise that you\u2019d\nhave to borrow billions of dollars just to meet that payroll,\u201d\nChristie said in Trenton. \u201cAt what cost?\u201d  Completion of the so-called ARC tunnel, for Access to the\nRegion\u2019s Core, would have added capacity for 25,000 additional\ndaily commuters, according to the Federal Transit\nAdministration. That equates to $5 billion in earnings, based on\nthe 2007 salary averages. The New York region\u2019s $1.3 trillion\neconomy is the world\u2019s second-largest, behind Tokyo, and ranks\n15th among countries, Medina said.  New Jersey Economy  New Jersey\u2019s economy, with 3.8 million jobs, has grown to\nexceed New York City\u2019s 3.7 million during the past 60 years,\nsaid  James Hughes , dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of\nPlanning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New\nBrunswick. That means an additional link to the city is not as\nvital as it was, he said,  Others say New Jersey, which already has $37.7 billion in\noutstanding debt and another $100 billion in unfunded pension\nand retiree health benefits, can do without the tunnel.  New Jersey commuters will still be able to reach New York\nCity\u2019s most lucrative jobs in the financial sector through\nexisting lines served by the Port Authority of New York & New\nJersey\u2019s PATH train line, particularly if firms locate in office\nspace under construction at the World Trade Center site in Lower\nManhattan, Hughes said. New Jersey Transit trains currently\nreach Penn Station through two century-old tubes.  Cost Estimates  At $10.9 billion, the midpoint estimate provided by the\nU.S. Department of Transportation last month, the scrapped\nproject would cost almost $440,000 for each of the 25,000\ncommuters it added to the transit system, said Gus Milano,\nexecutive vice president of closely held Hartz Mountain\nIndustries.  \u201cDoes that make sense? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Milano,\nwhose firm owns 38 million square feet of commercial and\nmultifamily property centered near the New Jersey entrance to\nthe proposed tunnel.  New Jersey\u2019s share of the latest $9.8 billion cost of the\nproject was to be $3.3 billion, including $1.25 billion in bonds\nbacked by New Jersey Turnpike Authority tolls, according to the\nFederal Transit Administration. Beyond that, the state was\nscheduled to be responsible for all costs beyond the $9.8\nbillion -- a bill Christie said on Nov. 1 could reach $8 billion\nto $10 billion.  \u201cIs it the best use of our resources when the state is\neffectively bankrupt? No,\u201d said Milano. A North Bergen, New\nJersey, building Hartz owned was among the 13 properties New\nJersey Transit acquired through condemnation for the tunnel\nproject, state records show.  \u201cIf we redeploy the resources, we could improve the\nbusiness climate,\u201d Milano said. \u201cIf we can reduce the state\nbudget and reduce taxes, industry will come to the state.\u201d  School Construction  The tunnel cancellation isn\u2019t the first time Christie has\nscaled back construction. He has also taken a knife to New\nJersey\u2019s $12.5 billion school-building program.  During the governor\u2019s first nine months in office,\nconstruction spending by the state Schools Development Authority\ntotaled $210 million, compared with $483 million during the\nfirst nine months of 2009, according to the agency\u2019s latest\n monthly financial report .  At the same time, construction jobs involved in the program\nhave dropped to 672 from 1,570 a year earlier, according to the\nauthority report.  Back at the canceled railroad tunnel\u2019s New Jersey entrance,\nthe mood has darkened at construction-union halls, such as\nTeamsters Local 560 in Union City, as the job outlook has\nworsened.  Employment Prospects  Workers who\u2019ve been winding down assignments on the $1.6\nbillion Meadowlands football stadium were counting on the tunnel\nto provide continued employment, said Tony Valdner, president of\nthe 4,000-member local.  \u201cI was looking at from 60 to 80 trucks a day on that\njob,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term thing.\u201d  Employment in the state\u2019s heavy construction industry is at\nan annual average of 15,400, the lowest since 1996, according to\nstate Department of Labor records. Construction employment is\nprojected to remain below 2008 levels through 2020, even if the\nARC Tunnel were built,  Nancy Mantell , director of Rutgers\nEconomic Advisory Service, said at a seminar on the New Jersey\neconomy today.  Building the tunnel would have generated as much as $9\nbillion in additional economic activity in New Jersey, New York\nand Connecticut during construction, including about $4 billion\nin wages, according to data filed with federal regulators. Work\non the project also would have generated $1.5 billion in local,\nstate and federal taxes, the environmental impact statement\nsaid.  \u201cThese are jobs that were anticipated were going to be\nconstructed and worked on from 2011 through 2016,\u201d Robert\nBriant Jr., chief executive officer of the 1,000-member Utility\nand Transportation Contractors Association, said. \u201cIt\u2019s work\nthat will not be replaced.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\n Dunstan McNichol  in Trenton, New Jersey, at \n dmcnichol@bloomberg.net ;\n Terrence Dopp  in Trenton, New Jersey, at \n tdopp@bloomberg.net .
