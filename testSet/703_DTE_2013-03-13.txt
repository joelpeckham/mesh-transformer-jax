The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ,  Germany \u2019s biggest\nsteelmaker, appointed  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  Chairman Ulrich Lehner\nto the same role on its supervisory board as it seeks a break\nwith the culture of 12 years under Gerhard Cromme.  The supervisory board plans to vote on Lehner\u2019s appointment\non March 19, the Essen, Germany-based company said in an e-\nmailed statement. Cromme announced last week that he would step\ndown as chairman at the end of the month.  \u201cThe entire supervisory board backs the realignment of the\ncompany announced by the board and the inherent change in\nculture,\u201d ThyssenKrupp said, indicating that the Alfried Krupp\nvon Bohlen Foundation, which holds 25 percent of the shares,\nbacks the move.  Cromme was handpicked more than 27 years ago by\nindustrialist Berthold Beitz, now 99 and head of the foundation,\nto take the helm at a predecessor of ThyssenKrupp\u2019s steel unit.\nThe now 70-year-old, who also chairs  Siemens AG (SIE) \u2019s supervisory\nboard, resisted calls to resign at the steelmaker\u2019s annual\ngeneral meeting in January in the biggest shareholder rebellion\nin the 14-year history of the merged company.  Lehner, born in 1946, spent three years at the former\nFried. Krupp GmbH\u2019s controlling department in the 1980s, before\nleaving to join  Henkel AG (HEN3)  & Co. KGaA, where he rose to CEO in\n2000. He has been on ThyssenKrupp\u2019s supervisory board since\n2008, alongside similar positions at Henkel,  Porsche Automobil\nHolding SE (PAH3) , E.ON SE, Deutsche Telekom and Novartis AG.  \u201cThat is a capable man,\u201d  Marc Gabriel, an analyst at\nBankhaus Lampe KG in Dusseldorf, said by phone.  \u201cHe is the\nright signal for the necessary new start in the supervisory\nboard.\u201d  ThyssenKrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger complained of a \u201clack\nof direction\u201d at the company when he assumed his present\nposition two years ago. He is now cutting the company\u2019s business\ndivisions to five from eight and the number of units to about\n400 from 750. His largest single transaction involves finding\nbuyers for the unprofitable Steel Americas business.  Hiesinger pledged in December to rid ThyssenKrupp of \u201cold\nstructures and habits.\u201d The company displayed \u201can\nunderstanding of leadership in which old boys networks and blind\nloyalty were more important than business success,\u201d he said.
