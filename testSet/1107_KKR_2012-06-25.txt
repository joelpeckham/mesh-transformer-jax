 "context": "The following article called 'Japanese Stocks Decline Second Day Ahead of Tax Hike Vote' was published on 2012-06-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapanese  stocks  dropped for a second\nday as opposition to a tax increase mounted among lawmakers\nbefore a key vote tomorrow and the yen strengthening. Drops were\nlimited as European leaders agreed to cooperate on a regional\ngrowth plan ahead of a summit this week.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that earns almost a third of\nits revenue from  North America , sank 2.7 percent.  Renesas\nElectronics Corp. (6723)  lost 2.7 percent after the Nikkei newspaper\nreported the chipmaker may sell 50 billion yen ($622 million) in\nnew shares. Fanuc Corp., a producer of automation controls for\nChinese factories, lost 1.6 percent after China\u2019s economic\ngrowth estimate was cut by Citigroup Inc.  Hosokawa Micron (6277)  Corp.,\na machine maker that gets 32 percent of its sales in Europe,\nadvanced 1.2 percent.  \u201cInvestors are in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d said  Naoki\nFujiwara , who helps oversee $6.5 billion at Shinkin Asset\nManagement Co. in Tokyo. \u201cEvents such the European leaders\u2019\nmeeting and Japan\u2019s consumption tax talks are happening this\nweek so investors can\u2019t take positions until we know how they\nwill go. \u201d  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.7 percent to 8,734.62\nat the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after earlier rising as much as 0.5\npercent. Volume was more than 25 percent below the 30-day\naverage. The broader Topix Index slid 0.8 percent to 745.22.  Japanese stocks extended declines after China\u2019s 2012\neconomic growth estimate reduced to 7.8 percent from 8.1 percent\nby Citigroup to reflect slowing domestic activity in the second\nquarter and further weakening of European demand.  Fanuc slid 1.6 percent to 12,620 yen.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a\nconstruction machinery maker that gets 14 percent of its sales\nin China, slipped 1.2 percent to 1,866 yen.  Tax Battle  About 50 Japanese lawmakers from the ruling  Democratic\nParty  of Japan will likely vote tomorrow against proposed social\nsecurity and tax reform legislation, the Nikkei newspaper\nreported, without saying where it got the information. The split\nthreatens to break up the ruling party.  \u201cUnless the consumption tax is raised, the government\u2019s\nfiscal situation will get tighter,  interest rates  will increase\nand the yen will strengthen,\u201d said Shinkin Asset\u2019s Fujiwara.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good for markets. If the consumption tax is raised,\nit may slightly drag down the economy, but that\u2019s less of a\nshock than not doing it.\u201d  The  Topix (MXAP)  has fallen 15 percent from its peak on March 27\non concern the debt crisis in Europe is spreading and as growth\nin the U.S. and China slows. Stocks on the gauge are valued at\n0.88 times book value, with a number below one meaning a company\ncan be bought for less than the value of its assets.  Among companies that fell, Renesas Electronics lost 2.7\npercent to 325 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported the\nchipmaker may sell new shares to private equity firm KKR & Co.  Euro Falls  The euro fell toward the lowest in more than a week before\nItaly and Spain sell debt tomorrow amid concern  Europe \u2019s fiscal\ncrisis is infecting larger economies in the bloc. The yen\nappreciated to as high as 110.42 against the euro today in Tokyo,\ncompared with 101.02 when stock opened trading this morning.\nAgainst the dollar, the Japanese currency strengthened to as\nhigh as 80.11 yen from 80.58. A stronger yen cuts overseas\nincome at Japanese companies when repatriated.  Nissan, which generates about 80 percent of its revenue\noverseas, sank 2.7 percent to 728 yen.  Canon Inc. (7731) , the world\u2019s\nbiggest camera maker, slid 2.5 percent to 3,170 yen.  Some stocks linked with Europe gained after Germany, Italy,\nFrance and Spain agreed in Rome on June 22 to cooperate on a\ngrowth plan of as much as 130 billion euros ($163 billion) for\nthe 17-nation bloc. French President  Francois Hollande  and\nItalian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  have been pushing for a\ncollectively financed stimulus plan. The summit will begin June\n28 in Brussels.  Hosokawa Micron  Hosokawa Micron climbed 1.2 percent to 425 yen. Olympus\nCorp., an optical-equipment maker that generates almost a fifth\nof its sales in Europe, added 0.8 percent to 1,206 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index slipped 0.5\npercent today. The index rose 0.7 percent in New York on June 22\nas bank downgrades from Moody\u2019s Investors Service were no worse\nthan the firm had warned.
