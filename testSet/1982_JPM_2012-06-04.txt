 "context": "The following article called 'Fed May Buy More Mortgage Bonds on Weak Jobs, Banks Say' was published on 2012-06-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  Federal Reserve  is more likely to\nbuy additional government-backed mortgage securities after the\npace of U.S. job creation slowed, underscoring the economy\u2019s\n fragility , according to Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Analysts at the banks joined researchers at Bank of America\nCorp., Barclays Plc and Nomura Securities International in\nsaying the odds are greater that Fed will add to its current\nprogram of reinvesting in the $5.4 trillion market with proceeds\nfrom past buying in reports published June 1. That day,\nbenchmark Treasury yields fell to record lows after data showed\nthe U.S. added 69,000 jobs in May, the fewest in a year and less\nthan the most-pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  With Morgan Stanley\u2019s economists and interest-rate\nstrategists now assigning 80 percent odds to a third round of\nso-called quantitative easing from the Fed, its mortgage-bond\nanalysts including Vipul Jain and Janaki Rao wrote that QE3 may\ninvolve about $200 billion in additional purchases of home-loan\ndebt over nine months, almost doubling the current program.  The Fed is already buying a \u201cfairly significant portion\u201d\nof agency mortgage-bond issuance and will be focused on \u201csmooth\nmarket functioning,\u201d limiting how much it more can buy, the New\nYork-based analysts wrote.  The amount could be about twice as big if the Fed decides\nto acquire larger amounts of 15-year securities and Ginnie Mae\ndebt, which it\u2019s been buying a smaller share of than 30-year and\n Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac securities because the notes aren\u2019t\n\u201cas directly supportive of the policy goals,\u201d they said. The\nanalysts recommended a \u201cmodest overweight\u201d on Fannie Mae 3\npercent and 3.5 percent notes relative to benchmark debt.  Operation Twist?  The Fed may choose to make a new round of its so-called\nOperation Twist involving acquisitions of mortgage securities,\nrather than Treasuries, instead of embarking on QE3, JPMorgan\nmortgage-bond analysts led by Matt Jozoff wrote. The size may be\nas much $100 billion to $200 billion, said the analysts, whose\nbank\u2019s economists now see 50 percent odds of QE3 in mortgages.\nThe analysts said they remained \u201coverweight\u201d agency mortgage\nbonds for several reasons.  The difference between yields on a Bloomberg index for\nFannie Mae current-coupon bonds and an average of five- and 10-\nyear Treasuries was 0.02 percentage point more than the 2012\naverage at 1.46 percentage point as of 3 p.m. in  New York , down\nfrom an average of 1.58 percent last year. That\u2019s a spread\nmetric often used by investors.  \u2018Unprecedented Environment\u2019  Bloomberg current-coupon indexes usually represent the\naverage of yields for the two groups of mortgage bonds with\nprices just above and below face value; the ones that lenders\ntypically package new loans into.  Currently, Fannie Mae 2.5 percent securities aren\u2019t trading\nactively, reducing the effectiveness of this market gauge.  \u201cWe are in an unprecedented environment and the standard\nanalytical tools for the mortgage market are facing significant\nchallenges,\u201d the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.  Nomura Securities International analysts including Ohmsatya Ravi and Ankur Mehta said they do not believe QE3 is the \u201cmost\nlikely outcome,\u201d though the odds have increased. They recommend\na \u201cneutral stance\u201d on agency mortgage securities with the\nlowest coupons.  \u201cWe maintain a modest overweight stance on agency MBS with\na down-in-coupon bias,\u201d Bank of America\u2019s mortgage-bond\nanalysts led by  Chris Flanagan  wrote.  Barclays analysts led by Ajay Rajadhyaksha said Fannie Mae\n3 percent securities represent a \u201cstrong candidate for QE3.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nJody Shenn in New York at \n jshenn@bloomberg.net .
