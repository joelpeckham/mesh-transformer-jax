The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. commercial real estate\ninvestors may turn to other opportunities as vacancies remain\nhigh and interest rates rise, according to Barry Sternlicht,\nchief executive officer of Starwood Capital Group LLC.  \n \u201cThere are a lot of tourists in property and REITs right\nnow,\u201d Sternlicht said at a panel discussion yesterday at the\nMilken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California.\n\u201cEverybody is racing for yield.\u201d  \n If interest rates head higher, \u201cyou will see a pause that\nwill take a lot of capital out,\u201d he said. Corporate bonds may\nbenefit, according to Sternlicht.  \n A rebound in the real estate market is being hampered by\nweak demand and commercial-mortgage-backed financing that\ndeclined 95 percent last year from its record level in 2007.\nVacancies in the first quarter rose to the highest level since\nat least 2000 at the nation\u2019s biggest malls, and climbed to a\n16-year peak at office buildings, research firm Reis Inc. said\nearlier this month.  \n U.S. commercial real estate values in February fell to 42\npercent below the market top in October 2007, according to the\nMoody\u2019s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index. Almost one-third\nof repeat sales transactions were of distressed properties,\ncompared with less than 20 percent in early 2009, Moody\u2019s said.  \n The Federal Reserve said earlier this month that the\neconomy expanded \u201csomewhat\u201d across most of the U.S. in March\nas consumer spending and manufacturing improved, signaling the\nrecovery is broadening without gaining much speed. Fed Chairman\nBen S. Bernanke and his colleagues have been debating how and\nwhen to tighten credit, including whether to modify a pledge to\nkeep interest rates low for an \u201cextended period.\u201d  \n Special Servicers  \n Deal volume may increase in 2011 when distressed buildings\nthat have been surrendered by owners to special servicers reach\nthe market, Michael Van Konynenburg, president of commercial\nbrokerage Eastdil Secured LLC in Los Angeles, said during the\npanel discussion.  \n Clearing the inventory of foreclosed properties will result\nin \u201ca lot more\u201d financing through the issuance of commercial\nmortgage backed securities, Van Konynenburg said.  \n Cheap debt fueled the commercial property surge with a\nrecord $237 billion in CMBS sales in 2007, according to JPMorgan\nChase & Co. Such sales fell last year to $12.2 billion.  \n The expected discounts for distressed buildings haven\u2019t\nmaterialized as investors holding \u201cmountains of cash\u201d compete\nfor those deals, said Sternlicht, whose firm is based in\nGreenwich, Connecticut.  \n \u201cWe were all joking that the distressed cycle lasted about\ntwo months,\u201d he said.  \n Any discounts for commercial real estate in distress have\nprobably come and gone, Sternlicht said.  \n \u201cI\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re going to see great\nopportunities,\u201d said panelist Richard LeFrak, CEO of New York-\nbased LeFrak Organization Inc. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I missed the\nwhole thing. It\u2019s like we blinked and it went away.\u201d  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\nDan Levy in San Francisco at \ndlevy13bloomberg.net;\nDaniel Taub in Los Angeles at \n dtaub@bloomberg.net .  \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Barry Sternlicht, chairman and chief executive officer of Starwood Capital Group LLC, speaks during the 2010 Milken Institute Global Conference in Los Angeles on April 26, 2010.
