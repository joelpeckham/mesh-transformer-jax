 "context": "The following article called 'Goldman Sachs May Sell Hedge Fund Unit to State Street' was published on 2012-06-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-\nbiggest U.S. bank by assets, is in talks to sell its hedge-fund\nadministration unit to  State Street Corp. (STT) , according to a person\nwith knowledge of the matter.  A final agreement is yet to be reached, said the person,\nwho declined to be identified because the negotiations are\nprivate. The unit provides fund accounting, valuation and risk-\nmanagement for hedge funds.  Regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission have increased oversight of companies that do\nbusiness with hedge funds in response to convicted fraudster\nBernard Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme and industry losses in 2008.\nState Street, the third-biggest custody bank, added $170 billion\nof hedge-fund and private-equity assets when it bought Mourant\nInternational Finance Administration, based in  Jersey  in the\nChannel Islands, in December 2009.  \u201cThis is a sensible move for Goldman Sachs in getting out\nof this largely unglamorous business, in which increased\nregulation and oversight from SEC has put additional risk on the\nadministrator without necessarily generating the commensurate\nrevenues,\u201d said Christopher Wheeler, analyst with Mediobanca\nSpA in London. Such sales have \u201cbecome a common practice for\nU.S. banks since the Madoff scandal, following a similar trend\nin Europe.\u201d  State Street had $506 billion in hedge-fund assets under\nadministration at the end of March, the Boston-based company\nsaid in an April 30  presentation .  \u201cAs a matter of policy, we don\u2019t comment on rumor or\nspeculation,\u201d  Hannah Grove , a State Street spokeswoman, said in\nan e-mail. A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman in  London  declined to\ncomment.  The combined business would have about $700 billion in\nassets, according to the Financial Times, which reported the\ntalks earlier today.
