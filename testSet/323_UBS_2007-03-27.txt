 "context": "The following article called 'Brazil's Bovespa Falls on Weakening U.S. Dollar: Latin Stocks' was published on 2007-03-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrazilian stocks fell for the first\nday in three as the dollar slid, threatening profits for exporters.  \n The  Bovespa index  of the most-traded stocks on the  Sao Paulo \nexchange fell 438.03, or 1 percent, to 45,206.53, led by iron-ore\nminer Cia. Vale do Rio Doce.  Mexico 's  Bolsa index  was little\nchanged, falling 34.64 to 28,124.33.  \n ``If the dollar continues to fall out there, it will also fall\nhere, strengthening the real,'' said Francisco Meirelles de Andrade, who helps manage 170 million reais in stocks at Nest\nInvestimentos in Sao Paulo. ``This is a problem for exporters, and\nparticularly for commodity exporters.''  \n The dollar fell against the euro and yen as U.S.  consumer\nconfidence  dropped this month, increasing the likelihood of a cut\nin borrowing costs by the  Federal Reserve . The U.S. currency also\nweakened as a private survey showed the price of homes in 20 U.S.\nmetropolitan areas fell in January for the first time in at least\nsix years and a Federal Reserve report showed a decline in\nmanufacturing this month.  \n The real last week was at its strongest level against the U.S.\ncurrency in more than 5 years, at 2.0535 reais to the dollar on\nMarch 21.  \n Shares of Vale, the world's biggest iron-ore producer, fell 72\ncentavos, or 1.1 percent, to 63.99 reais. A Brazilian federal court\nupheld an antitrust regulator's ruling to end Vale's rights to\nexports from the Casa da Pedra iron ore mine,  Valor Economico \nreported. Vale will either have to give up rights to the mine,\nwhich is owned by Cia. Siderurgica Nacional, or sell a nearby mine,\nValor said.  \n CSN,  Brazil 's third-largest steelmaker, fell 59 centavos, or\n0.7 percent, to 87.51 reais.  \n The decline Mexico was led by cement producer Cemex SAB, which\nfell 94 centavos, or 2.5 percent, to 36.82 pesos on concern that\nthe slump in the U.S. housing market signals reduced demand for\nMexican exports.  \n ``Geo-political tensions, sub-prime mortgages and consumer\nconfidence have made people who recently reinvested in the market\nnervous,'' Victor Rios, a trader at SEI Compass Investments in\nMexico City, said in a telephone interview. ``The market's closely\nwatching the economic data, and it may overreact.''  \n Shares of companies involved in the U.S. construction industry\nfell on signs of weakness in the real estate market. Cemex has\ndropped 3.8 percent in three days. The U.S. buys about 80 percent\nof Mexico's exports.  \n Merval Drops  \n Argentina 's Merval index fell 16.74, or 0.8 percent, to\n2060.28, led by Banco Macro SA, the fourth-largest non-state bank.\nBanco Macro fell 30 centavos, or 2.8 percent, to 10.55 pesos.  \n ``The market is just very mindful of where the  U.S. economy  is\ngoing,'' Rafael Ber, an economist at Argentine Research in  Buenos\nAires , said in a phone interview.  \n In other Latin American markets, the main indexes in  Chile  and\nVenezuela fell, while indexes in Colombia and  Peru  rose. The Morgan\nStanley Capital International index of Latin American stocks fell\n0.9 percent to 3100.66.  \n Brazil  \n Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo  (CESP6 BS), Brazil's third-\nlargest power generator, rose 25 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to 27.50\nreais. UBS strategist Pedro Batista reiterated a ``buy 2'' rating\non the stock and raised the price target to 36 reais a share from\n30 reais. The increase for state-controlled Cesp is based on\nBrazil's macroeconomic outlook and doesn't take into account the\nlikelihood of privatization, which Cesp executives said could\nhappen within 120 days with government approval, Batista wrote in\nan e-mailed report. The sale of state-controlled assets may lead to\nan offer price of 45 reais a share, Batista wrote.  \n MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3 BS) rose 19.97 reais, or\n2.7 percent, to 749.97 reais. Brazil's third-largest iron-ore\nproducer's plans to split operations into mining and logistics\nunits is likely to help each management team focus on maximizing\nvalue, UBS Pactual analyst Edmo Chagas wrote in a report e-mailed\nyesterday. The logistics unit may bring higher valuations due to\nits less cyclical nature, and the mining unit would be better able\nto focus on ongoing projects, Chagas wrote.  \n Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  (PETR4 BS), Brazil's state-controlled\noil company, fell 44 centavos, or 1 percent, to 44.16 reais. Crude\noil was little changed in  New York  after reaching a three-month\nhigh on concern supplies may be disrupted after  Iran  seized British\nforces and the  United Nations  imposed new sanctions on the country.  \n Chile  \n Colbun SA (COLBUN)   fell 1.99 pesos, or 1.9 percent, to\n105.50 pesos. UBS Pactual analyst Brian Chase downgraded shares of\nChile's third-biggest generator yesterday to ``reduce,'' citing\nhigher-than-expected costs.  \n Mexico  \n America Movil SAB (AMXL)  ,  Latin America 's largest mobile-\nphone company, fell 16 centavos, or 0.6 percent, to 25.71 pesos.\n America Movil  is one of two remaining bidders for America Network,\na cable operator based in  El Salvador , with operations in four\nother Central American countries, Reforma reported yesterday.  \n Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico SAB  (GAPB MM), the operator\nof 12 Mexican airports, fell 43 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to 46.01\npesos. Shares fell for a second day after the Mexican government\nyesterday grounded Lineas Aereas Azteca over safety concerns.\nAzteca made up 5.5 percent of Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico's\npassenger traffic last year and 3.2 percent of revenue, the airport\noperator said in a statement sent via PR Newswire.  \n U.S. Commercial Corp. (USCOMB1 MM), the holding company for\nretail chain CompUSA Inc., fell 2 centavos, or 1.5 percent, to 1.33\npesos. The company will raise $440 million by selling additional\nstock to existing shareholders. Shareholders have until April 18 to\nchoose to buy as many as three new shares for each share they\ncurrently own, U.S. Commercial Corp. said in a statement to the\nMexican stock exchange today. Any unsubscribed shares can be bought\nfor 1.30 pesos a share by Grupo Carso SA, which like U.S.\nCommercial is controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim . Shares of\nCarso (GCARSOA1 MM) fell 54 centavos, or 1.4 percent, to 38.52\npesos.  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\nWilliam Freebairn in Mexico City \n wfreebairn@bloomberg.net ;\nPaulo Winterstein in Sao Paulo at  at\n pwinterstein@bloomberg.net .  \n To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChris Nagi at   chrisnagi@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 36.89215087890625 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
