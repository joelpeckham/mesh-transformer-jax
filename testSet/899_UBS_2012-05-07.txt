 "context": "The following article called 'China Gamblers Spurring Echo Deal for Sydney Monopoly' was published on 2012-05-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEcho Entertainment Group Ltd. (EGP)  is\npoised to become the target of the largest casino takeover in\nmore than five years, thanks to its monopoly in Sydney and 16\nmillion potential Chinese gamblers.  As allegations of sexual harassment at Echo\u2019s showpiece\nSydney casino The Star pushed its shares to an  all-time low  this\nyear, Melbourne-based rival Crown Ltd. doubled its  stake  in Echo\nto 10 percent and asked for regulatory approval to buy more.\nEven after the move sparked a record rebound in Echo\u2019s shares,\nthe Brisbane-based company is still trading at 1.9 times sales,\nless than one-third the average for Asian gaming companies,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  With the only casino in Sydney, Echo offers suitors a\nchance to tap so-called VIP gamblers from  China . As they venture\nbeyond  Macau , VIP wagers at Echo\u2019s and Crown\u2019s tables may rise\nto $100 billion by 2014, UBS AG estimates. Crown, backed by\nbillionaire  James Packer , may be joined by  Genting Singapore Plc (GENS) \nand  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  in seeking to acquire Echo, UBS said.\nGenting could pay A$4.5 billion ($4.6 billion) in a takeover,\naccording to Macquarie Group Ltd., which would be 44 percent\nabove Echo\u2019s current market value and the largest offer for a\ngaming company since 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cThese kinds of licenses don\u2019t come up every day,\u201d said\nSacha Krien, an analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in Sydney.\n\u201cThey provide exposure to Chinese casino tourism. We believe a\nbid from Crown is imminent.\u201d  Momofuku  The board of Echo \u201cwould be supportive of any\ntransactional initiative\u201d that boosts  shareholder value ,\nspokesman Brad Schmitt said by e-mail.  Echo, spun out of  Australia \u2019s largest sports betting group\n Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. (TAH)  last June, has spent A$870 million since\n2008 renovating The Star on the shores of Sydney Harbour. The\ncomplex now features a new five-star hotel, invitation-only\ngaming rooms, the first branch of David Chang\u2019s Momofuku\nrestaurant chain outside of  New York , and two leased private\njets to fly in high-rolling gamblers.  While that has improved the ambiance of the property, the\nspending is not yet factoring into Echo\u2019s valuation, according\nto Sam Theodore, an analyst at UBS.  At last week\u2019s closing price of A$4.55 a share, Echo traded\nat 1.9 times its sales of  A$1.65 billion  for the fiscal year\nended in June 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nEcho was still part of Tabcorp for most of that period. That\ncompared with an average ratio of 6.4 for casino and gaming\ncompanies in  Asia  with a market value of more than $1 billion.  Echo  fell  0.9 percent to A$4.51 a share in Sydney today.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 Index closed down 2.2 percent, its biggest loss\nsince December. Crown  dropped  2.6 percent to A$8.95 per share.  Relative Value  Echo is valued at  13.9 times  its A$226 million in profit\nfor the last fiscal year, while its Asian rivals current trade\nat an average of 20.8 times earnings, the data show.  \u201cEcho\u2019s undervalued,\u201d Theodore said in an interview in\nSydney. \u201cIt\u2019s opportunistic to buy it now because someone\u2019s\nspent the money without the market giving them credit.\u201d  Echo\u2019s shares plunged to a closing low of A$3.48 on Feb. 16\nafter the New South  Wales  state Independent Liquor and Gaming\nAuthority said it appointed an investigator to look into\nallegations that Sid Vaikunta, former managing director of The\nStar, made \u201cunwelcome sexual advances\u201d to a staff member.\nVaikunta left Echo \u201cafter his behavior in a social work\nsetting,\u201d Echo said Feb. 2.  The company \u201cwelcomes the opportunity for an independent\ninvestigation,\u201d Echo said Feb. 16. Vaikunta couldn\u2019t be located\nto comment on the allegations and Echo and the casino\u2019s\nregulator said they had no contact details for him.  \u2018Negative Allegations\u2019  The share-price drop may have created an opportunity for\nCrown, which on Feb. 24 said it became Echo\u2019s  largest\nshareholder  with a 10 percent stake, triggering a one-day, 13\npercent gain in the stock. Crown said it was seeking a seat on\nEcho\u2019s board and government permission -- a requirement of\nEcho\u2019s constitution -- to raise its holding beyond 10 percent.  \u201cAny negative allegations and claims made against Echo\nmanagement could be used to highlight  Crown\u2019s (CWN)  own management\ncredentials in a bid to win investor support for a takeover\nbid,\u201d CLSA\u2019s Krien wrote in an April 12 note to clients.  Ken Barton, Crown\u2019s chief financial officer, didn\u2019t return\ncalls seeking comment on the company\u2019s intentions regarding\nEcho. Genting  Singapore , in an e-mailed response to questions,\ndeclined to comment on a potential acquisition.  For potential buyers, Echo\u2019s refurbished Sydney casino may\noffer a way to profit as gamblers from mainland China venture\nbeyond Macau, the world\u2019s biggest gambling market and the only\nplace in China where casinos are legal.  Macau Tourists  The former Portuguese colony last year  attracted  16.2\nmillion mainland Chinese tourists. The 11-square mile\nterritory\u2019s total gambling revenue of  $34 billion  in 2011 was\nnearly six times the $6.1 billion of the Las Vegas Strip.  With Macau\u2019s hotels running out of rooms, companies in\nSingapore and Australia are looking for ways to capture some of\nthe gambling money from mainland China, said UBS\u2019s Theodore.  \u201cMacau just doesn\u2019t have the capacity for all the money\nthat Asia\u2019s gamblers are prepared to spend, and Singapore and\nAustralia are ways of tapping that overflow,\u201d he said.  The most prized customers are VIPs, who are treated to all-\nexpense paid holidays to casinos because of the large sums they\nwager at the gaming tables, said Gary Pinge, an analyst at\nMacquarie in  Hong Kong . Macau\u2019s high rollers generated $25\nbillion of revenue in 2011 from the  baccarat  tables alone.  As these gamblers are lured to Australia, bets by the VIPs\nat Echo and Crown\u2019s casinos could rise to $100 billion by 2014,\nfrom $60 billion last year, UBS estimates. Gambling revenue for\ncasino operators -- the house\u2019s net winnings on all bets -- is\ntypically only a small proportion of the amount wagered.  Sydney Ambition  \u201cThe main asset in a casino VIP business is its database\nof customers,\u201d Pinge said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe more\nproperties you have the more synergies you can get.\u201d  Genting Singapore, the only large Asian casino operator\nwithout a stake in Macau, needs to add to its Resorts World\ncomplex in Singapore, according to Pinge. Australia\u2019s mature\ncasino industry is well-placed to fulfill that role, he said.\nCrown has a 33 percent share in  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883) ,\nwhich holds one of Macau\u2019s six casino resort licenses.  About 542,000 short-term visitors came to Australia from\nChina last year, a 76 percent increase from 2006, according to\nthe country\u2019s  statistics bureau .  \u201cEighty percent of travelers out of China end up going to\na gaming venue on their first trip,\u201d said  David Wiadrowski , an\nentertainment and media partner at PwC in Sydney. \u201cWith the\nrenovations at The Star, they\u2019re trying to do as much as they\ncan to attract as many as they can.\u201d  Sydney\u2019s Opera House  Echo would have its own attraction to  Crown\u2019s chairman  and\nlargest shareholder Packer, giving him control of Echo\u2019s casino\nlicense in Sydney, which grants it a monopoly there until 2019,\nas well as licenses for three other casinos in Australia.  Packer, 44, wants to build a 350-room casino-hotel with\nviews of Sydney\u2019s Harbour Bridge and Opera House at the\nBarangaroo development site near the city\u2019s central business\ndistrict. To do that, he would need to convince Echo and the New\nSouth Wales\u2019s state government to grant a separate permit, or\ntake over Echo altogether.  Steve Wynn\u2019s Las Vegas-based Wynn Resorts or its majority\nowned  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  are also potential suitors for Echo,\naccording to UBS\u2019s Theodore. Wynn would like a toehold in\nAustralia for the same reason as Genting Singapore -- to find a\nnew destination for its high-rolling clients, he said.  \u201cGenting\u2019s in Singapore but it\u2019s not in Macau. Wynn\u2019s in\nMacau but it\u2019s not in Singapore. It\u2019s about adding another\ngeographic option for their VIP customers,\u201d Theodore said.  \u2018Virtually Impossible\u2019  In an e-mail, a spokesman for Wynn said he was unaware of\nany discussions between Echo and Wynn Resorts.  If Packer wins permission to raise his holding, Crown\u2019s\nstake could make it difficult for a rival to complete an\nacquisition, according to Adam Alexander, an analyst with\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc.  \u201cIf Crown moves to 20 percent it makes it virtually\nimpossible for those guys to come in and take it over,\u201d he said\nby phone from  Melbourne . \u201cTrying to go head to head with Packer\nin his own market would not make sense.\u201d  Crown may have less capacity to finance a deal than Genting\nSingapore or Wynn. With only $194 million in  cash , Crown\u2019s $577\nmillion of operating cash flow in the 12 months through December\ncompared with Wynn\u2019s $1.5 billion and Genting Singapore\u2019s $1.1\nbillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  If Crown funded 60 percent of a A$3.5 billion offer with\nits own shares, the remaining A$1.4 billion of debt would put\nCrown\u2019s credit ratings under pressure, Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s credit\nstrategists said in a March 12 note to clients. The company is\nthe only gaming stock to be judged  investment grade  by all three\nmajor credit rating companies.  \u2018Change of Control\u2019  Genting Singapore, with $2.5 billion in cash at the end of\nDecember, raised another S$1.8 billion ($1.5 billion) by selling\nbonds in March, to finance \u201ccapital expenditure and the\nexpansion of its business.\u201d  Packer may be able to help fund a bid by selling other\nstakes.  Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd. (CMJ) , 50 percent owned by\nthe billionaire, said last week it held talks for a \u201cchange of\ncontrol.\u201d  Officials at Consolidated Media, which has a market\nvalue of A$1.8 billion, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Genting Singapore, controlled by Malaysia\u2019s  Genting Bhd. (GENT) ,\nwhich opened a casino at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, New\nYork, last year, could \u201ccomfortably\u201d afford to pay A$6.50 per\nEcho share and still boost its earnings, Macquarie\u2019s Pinge said.  \u201cIf there was a bidding war, Genting would be hard to\nbeat,\u201d said CLSA\u2019s Krien. \u201cThey are cashed up.\u201d  Casino Deals  A bid at that level would value Echo at a multiple of 20\ntimes its fiscal 2011 earnings. That compares with a median of\n26 times profit paid in 41 acquisitions of gambling companies in\nthe past decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  An offer of as much as A$5.30 a share, or 16 percent above\nEcho\u2019s current price, would still be \u201cvalue accretive,\u201d to\nCrown, said CLSA\u2019s Krien. A takeover at either price would be\nthe largest of a gaming company since the buyout of Las Vegas-\nbased Station Casinos Inc. announced in December 2006 for $8.5\nbillion, including net debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cTo get into this market you have to have a license,\u201d\nsaid UBS\u2019s Theodore. \u201cAnd it\u2019s unlikely that governments in\nAustralia will issue any more.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nDavid Fickling in Sydney at \n dfickling@bloomberg.net ;\nAngus Whitley in Sydney at \n awhitley1@bloomberg.net ;\nBrett Foley in Melbourne at \n bfoley8@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nDaniel Hauck at \n dhauck1@bloomberg.net ;\nKatherine Snyder at \n ksnyder@bloomberg.net ;\nPhilip Lagerkranser at \n lagerkranser@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 7.862120151519775 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
