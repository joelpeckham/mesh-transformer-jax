 "context": "The following article called 'Vodafone $10 Billion Dividend Quandary Draws Investor Ire' was published on 2012-07-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMore than a decade after  Vodafone\nGroup Plc (VOD)  started a U.S. mobile-phone partnership with  Verizon\nCommunications Inc. (VZ) , payments from the venture are still\nuncertain and investors\u2019 patience is wearing thin.  A year ago,  Verizon Wireless  announced a $10 billion\ndividend, the first payout since 2005. The venture\u2019s board is\nset to decide on the size of this year\u2019s payout as early as this\nweek, said two people with knowledge of the matter, asking not\nto be identified as the discussions are private.  \u201cThe uncertainty generated by not having a regular\ndividend policy from Verizon Wireless is very annoying,\u201d said\nPeter Braendle, who helps manage about $55 billion at Zurich-\nbased  Swisscanto Asset Management , including Vodafone shares.\n\u201cDividends were and still are very important to attract new\ninvestors, especially for Vodafone, amid such a challenging\neconomic environment.\u201d  The need for Vodafone, which owns 45 percent of Verizon\nWireless, to negotiate a payment each year from the largest U.S.\nmobile operator is fanning discontent among  investors  at a time\nwhen the Newbury, England-based company faces the threat of a\n$3.6 billion tax bill in  India  and is poised to report a\nslowdown in revenue growth this week.  Vodafone Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford said in May\nthat a dividend should come in \u201chopefully on a reasonably\nregular basis.\u201d The same month, Chief Executive Officer\n Vittorio Colao  called the U.S. dividend a \u201cluxury problem with\nVerizon paying all this cash.\u201d  Crucial Dividends  Shareholder payouts are crucial for European operators, the\n third-worst  performer of 19 industry groups in the  Europe  Stoxx\n600 Index this year, to attract investors as they use stable\ncash flows from phone contracts to pay higher-than-average\ndividends.  Vodafone\u2019s dividend yield, at 7.4 percent, trails that of\nEurope\u2019s biggest phone companies, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) \u2019s yield is 7.6 percent, compared\nwith 12.9 percent for  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and 10.6 percent for\nTelefonica SA. The average for Western European operators that\npay a dividend is 7.5 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for\n North America \u2019s biggest phone companies.  When Vodafone received the $4.5 billion dividend from the\nventure last year, it paid 2 billion pounds ($3.1 billion) of it\nas a special dividend to shareholders. Previously, Verizon had\nwithheld the dividend from the partnership to focus on paying\ndown debt.  \u2018Huge Headache\u2019  \u201cThe dividend issue is a huge headache for Vodafone,\u201d\nsaid Espen Furnes, who manages the  Delphi Europa (DFEUROP)  fund at Oslo-\nbased  Storebrand Asset Management , which oversees $72 billion\nand until April owned shares in Vodafone. \u201cVodafone seems to be\nunable to resolve the dividend situation and they either need to\nbuy the remaining stake or sell it, but both options don\u2019t seem\nfeasible now.\u201d  Vodafone repeatedly opted to keep its stake in the venture.\nVerizon, based in  New York , said in May 2010 it would be\ninterested in purchasing Vodafone\u2019s holding and the partners\nheld talks in March 2010, discussing options, including a\nmerger, buyout or a dividend payout, two people familiar with\nthe deliberations said at the time.  The board of Verizon Wireless, which is made up of\nexecutives from both owners, may decide on a smaller dividend\nafter the operator last year agreed to pay $3.6 billion for\nmobile frequencies from  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , Time Warner Cable Inc.\nand Bright House Networks LLC, said Swisscanto\u2019s Braendle.  Slowing Growth  \u201cEven as I expect the dividend from Verizon Wireless to be\nsimilar to last year\u2019s, it would also be reasonable to see a\nlower dividend,\u201d he said.  Verizon Wireless had $12.8 billion in cash and cash\nequivalents at the end of 2011, and paid $10 billion of that as\ndividend. At the end of 2010, the operator had $5.3 billion in\ncash and cash equivalents.  Vodafone may say on July 20 that service revenue growth,\nexcluding currency swings and acquisitions, slowed to 0.8\npercent in the three months through June, after rising 1.5\npercent a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of\nanalysts.  The company, which is no longer the world\u2019s biggest mobile-\nphone company after  China Mobile Ltd. (941)  boosted sales last year,\nis increasingly relying on its U.S. wireless venture to make up\nfor shrinking sales in crisis-stricken European economies,\nincluding Spain and  Italy .  Dividend Lure  \u201cThe main driver for investors to buy telecom stocks,\nincluding Vodafone, has been dividends,\u201d said Heinrich Ey, a\n fund manager  at Allianz Global Investors in  Frankfurt , which\nmanages about 300 billion euros, including Vodafone shares.  Vodafone rose 1.4 percent to 185.20 pence in  London  today,\nvaluing the company at 91.2 billion pounds. Verizon\nCommunications gained 0.9 percent to $46.09 as of 12:31 p.m. in\nNew York, giving the company a market value of $130.1 billion.  Verizon Wireless accounted for 42 percent of Vodafone\u2019s\noperating profit, excluding some items, last year. In India,\nVodafone may face a bill of as much as 200 billion rupees ($3.7\nbillion) as the government considers amending the law to get tax\ncontributions from the 2007 acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa\nLtd.\u2019s local operations.  Verizon Communications tomorrow may report second-quarter\nsales of $28.5 billion, up from $27.5 billion a year earlier,\naccording to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Verizon Communications needs the dividend as well and can\u2019t\nafford to avoid distributing Verizon Wireless\u2019s cash for long,\nsaid  Todd Lowenstein , a Los Angeles-based fund manager at\nHighmark Capital Management Inc., which oversees about $17\nbillion, including Vodafone shares.  Teasing Investors  Verizon Communications gets the remaining 35 percent of its\nrevenue from Internet connections and the declining home phone\nmarket in the U.S. It has also committed to paying its own\n shareholders  about 50 cents a share per quarter, which amounted\nto about $5.6 billion last year.  \u201cVerizon needs the distributions from the wireless\nbusiness to fund its own ongoing dividend,\u201d Lowenstein said.  Still, Verizon may be teasing Vodafone\u2019s investors with the\ndividend as it evaluates a bid for Vodafone\u2019s stake in the\nwireless venture, said James Britton, the head of\ntelecommunications research at Nomura Holdings Inc. Verizon\u2019s\nshare price, which has risen 15 percent this year while Vodafone\ngained 3.5 percent, may provide leverage in a deal, he said.  \u201cThey may well have an interest in Vodafone\u2019s share price\na little lower because in a combination scenario, it would be\neasier for them to make a merger more appealing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\ncould offer a better premium to a lower share price.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAmy Thomson in London at \n athomson6@bloomberg.net ;\nScott Moritz in New York at \n smoritz6@bloomberg.net ;\nManuel Baigorri in Madrid at \n mbaigorri@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \n kwong11@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Comcast Corporation - Class A was 13.624871253967285 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Comcast Corporation - Class A was ",
