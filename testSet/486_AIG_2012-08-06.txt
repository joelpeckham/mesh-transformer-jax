 "context": "The following article called 'AIG Doubles U.K. Exposure as Euro-Zone Risk Declines' was published on 2012-08-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmerican International Group Inc. (AIG) ,\nthe insurer bailed out by the U.S. Treasury Department, more\nthan doubled its risk related to the U.K. government while\nscaling back in Germany and  France .  AIG\u2019s aggregate credit risk tied to the U.K. surged to\n$3.42 billion as of June 30 from $1.39 billion three months\nearlier, the insurer said in a quarterly filing. The figure for\nGermany fell 16 percent to $1.38 billion, and French risk\ndropped 11 percent to $1.01 billion.  The insurer is reshuffling its  portfolio  as it seeks to\nboost returns with yields near a record low. AIG has retreated\nfrom risk in nations that share the euro as a debt crisis in\n Greece  and rising borrowing costs from  Spain  to  Italy  threaten\nthe common currency. The U.K. is the largest European economy\nwith its own currency.  \u201cThey\u2019re trying to reduce some of their euro exposure,\u201d\nsaid Paul Newsome an analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP.\n\u201cThey probably think that it\u2019s a relative safe haven within the\ngreater European environment.\u201d  Credit risk can involve fixed-maturity securities,\nderivatives, equities, leases and other agreements, AIG said in\nthe Aug. 2 filing, which also lists ties to companies such as\nbanks. The U.S. government was AIG\u2019s single largest credit\nexposure, at 23 percent of total equity, and exposure to the\nfinancial sector was $95.3 billion, or 90 percent of total\nequity. Jim Ankner, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment.  AIG\u2019s largest sovereign risk after the U.S. was  Japan , at\n$8.87 billion, mostly related to holdings of insurance\noperations in the country, according to the filing. The firm\nsaid it had no direct or guaranteed credit exposure to Greek or\nIrish governments. Total euro zone exposure was $3.72 billion,\ndown from $4.12 billion at the end of the first quarter.  Greece Outlook  AIG has assigned staff from  Argentina  to advise their\ncounterparts in  Athens  as the insurer prepares for a possible\nGreece exit from the euro,  Peter Hancock , who heads the\nproperty-casualty unit, said in May.  MetLife Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  has\nsaid that AIG disregarded his hints to sell European debt from\nperipheral countries before MetLife bought an AIG unit.  \u201cI was sending smoke signals to my friends at AIG, \u2018Please\nsell the peripheral debt,\u2019\u201d Kandarian said in February. \u201cI\ncouldn\u2019t do much more than send smoke signals, and they chose\nnot to sell.\u201d  U.K. gilts had returned 3.4 percent this year as of Aug. 3,\naccording to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. That\ncompares with a gain of 2.3 percent for Treasuries, 3.3 percent\nfor German bunds and 3.4 percent for sovereign debt globally.\nThe pound has advanced about 5 percent against the euro this\nyear and less than 1 percent versus the dollar.  Credit Ratings  Standard & Poor\u2019s  affirmed in July its AAA rating on the\nU.K., saying that the government \u201cremains committed to\nimplementing its fiscal program.\u201d The ratings company\ndowngraded the U.S. by one level a year ago.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has pressed on\nwith his planned fiscal squeeze to help protect Britain\u2019s credit\nrating even after the economy slipped into a double-dip\nrecession. Gross domestic product fell 0.7 percent in the second\nquarter, the biggest decline in more than three years.  Bond investors \u201chave a declining number of options,\u201d\nJason Brady, a managing director at Thornburg Investment\nManagement in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico , which oversees $80 billion,\nsaid Aug. 3 in a telephone interview. \u201cThe U.K. is doing the\nright things. They are doing what people would like and they\nhave crappy growth as a result, but they have one of the more\nsolid balance sheets out there.\u201d  U.K. Forecasts  Moody\u2019s Investors Service has cut its growth forecasts for\nthe U.K. and said the government will face increased\ndifficulties in meeting its debt-reduction timetable. Moody\u2019s\nsees the U.K. economy growing 0.4 percent this year and 1.8\npercent in 2013. The economy will return to trend growth of 2.5\npercent, though this will take longer than previously expected,\nMoody\u2019s said.  The cost to protect against a default by the U.K. has\nfallen this year. Credit-default swaps on the nation declined to\n55.3 basis points as of Aug. 3, compared with 97.5 basis points\nat the end of last year, according to data provider CMA, which\nis owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by\ndealers in the privately negotiated market.  Swaps tied to  Germany  are quoted at about 68 basis points.\nContracts linked to the U.S. are quoted at 46 basis points and\nFrance\u2019s at 152 basis points, CMA prices show.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails\nto meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A\nbasis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10\nmillion of debt.
