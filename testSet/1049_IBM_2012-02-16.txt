(IBM)  in helping companies with their computer network\nsetups, rose as much as 8.4 percent in Paris, the biggest jump\nsince Oct. 4. The shares were 3.6 percent higher at 30.29 euros\nas of 10:45 a.m. The stock was the biggest gainer on France\u2019s\nbenchmark CAC 40 Index.  \u201cWe think we can achieve margin improvement despite very\nuneven hypotheses for the second half of 2012,\u201d Chief Executive\nOfficer Paul Hermelin said on a conference call. He predicted\n2012 sales growth \u201csimilar or higher than\u201d in the fourth\nquarter of last year, when revenue climbed 3.3 percent.  Cap Gemini  forecast higher margins amid \u201climited\u201d revenue\ngrowth expectations after beating analyst estimates in 2011.
