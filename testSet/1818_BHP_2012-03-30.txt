 "context": "The following article called 'Baoshan Steel Profit Falls to 2 1/2-Year Low on Weak Auto Demand' was published on 2012-03-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBaoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019) , China\u2019s\nbiggest publicly traded steelmaker, posted its lowest quarterly\nprofit in more than two years amid high  iron ore  prices and\nslowing demand from automakers and builders.  Net income fell 55 percent to 1.04 billion yuan ($165\nmillion) in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from 2.29 billion\nyuan a year earlier, based on Baoshan\u2019s full-year earnings\n reported  today in Shanghai. The profit is the lowest since the\nsecond quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Baoshan, which supplies half of China\u2019s automobile steel\nmarket, is facing slowing demand after the government last year\nhalted incentives and imposed restrictions on vehicle purchases\nto reduce traffic. Steelmakers in  China , the world\u2019s biggest\nproducer, incurred a combined loss in the fourth quarter as\ntighter credit and housing curbs reined in consumption,\naccording to the China Iron and Steel Association.  \u201cWe see moderate recovery in steel demand and stable iron\nore prices this year,\u201d Sarah Wang, an analyst with  Masterlink\nSecurities Corp. (2856)  in Shanghai, said before the earnings\nannouncement. \u201cIt can\u2019t be worse than the fourth quarter for\nthe steelmakers.\u201d  Full-year profit fell 43 percent to 7.36 billion yuan,\nBaoshan said. The company had announced a preliminary profit of\n7.3 billion yuan on Jan. 13.  Baoshan advanced 0.4 percent to close at 4.77 yuan before\nthe earnings announcement, compared with the 0.5 percent gain in\nthe benchmark  Shanghai  Composite Index.  Falling Demand  \u201cSteel demand dropped drastically in 2011, further\nsqueezing profits as prices of raw materials, including iron\nore, steel scraps and coke continued climbing,\u201d Baoshan said in\nthe statement. \u201cWe\u2019ll focus on the development of high-quality\ncarbon steel products and strengthen cost management to make\nsure that we remain the best-performing company in the domestic\n steel industry .\u201d  Imported iron ore prices gained 28 percent last year from a\nyear ago, Baoshan said.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  pared China\u2019s annual economic growth\ntarget to 7.5 percent this month, compared with a goal of 8\npercent over the past seven years, to lessen reliance on\ninvestment and exports and increase the role of domestic\nconsumption. That shift is slowing steel production growth, said\n BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world\u2019s third-biggest iron ore exporter.  Short of Target  China\u2019s vehicle sales this year will probably miss their 8\npercent growth forecast as the slowing economy and rising fuel\ncosts curb buying, Gu Xianghua, deputy secretary general of the\nChina Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said March 20.\nTotal vehicle deliveries may fail to increase by even 5 percent,\nhe said.  Still, Baosteel Group Corp., Baoshan\u2019s state-owned parent,\nexpects that the government\u2019s efforts to encourage spending may\nboost China\u2019s car sales this year, spurring demand for\nautomobile steel to rise faster than last year, Baosteel\nChairman  Xu Lejiang  said March 5.  Baoshan aims to complete on April 1 the sale of its\nunprofitable stainless steel and specialty steel units to its\nparent for 45.2 billion yuan, in a move to boost profitability,\nit said today.  The stainless steel unit, China\u2019s second-biggest producer\nof the rust-proof alloy, had a loss of 1.1 billion yuan last\nyear and the special steel unit incurred a loss of 531 million\nyuan, Baoshan said last month.  \u201cThe proposed plan to spin off the stainless steel sector\nis also good news to investors,\u201d Masterlink\u2019s Wang said.  Baoshan aims to sell 24.25 million metric tons of steel\nproducts this year, down from 25.8 million tons in 2011, the\ncompany said today. Revenue is expected to decline to 216\nbillion yuan from 222.9 billion yuan, Baoshan said.
