 "context": "The following article called 'Romania Holds EU\u2019s Highest Rate Ninth Time on Inflation' was published on 2013-05-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRomania\u2019s central bank kept the\nEuropean Union\u2019s highest borrowing costs unchanged for a ninth\nmeeting, while paving the way for a cycle of  interest-rate  cuts\namid a faster-than-predicted slowdown in inflation.  The Banca Nationala a Romaniei left the benchmark rate at\n5.25 percent today, according to an e-mailed  statement , matching\nthe estimates of all 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. It cut\nthe overnight Lombard rate by 100 basis points and raised the\ndeposit-facility rate by the same amount in a bid to lower rates\non leu borrowing and curb money-market volatility.  \u201cOur message is: we\u2019ll start a cycle that we hope we won\u2019t\nhave to interrupt\u201d because of the possible negative effect of\npoor weather on agriculture and the economy, central bank\nGovernor Mugur Isarescu told reporters today in Bucharest.\u201cThis\ncycle will include several sessions of reductions of the\nmonetary policy rate.\u201d  Romania  halted a rate-cutting cycle a year ago as poor\nagricultural output boosted food prices and a pledge to the\n International Monetary Fund  and the EU to free energy tariffs\nincreased utility bills. It\u2019s seeking to join other countries in\nthe region, which are dropping rates to spur growth as the euro\narea struggles with a debt crisis, as inflation will probably\nslow to within a targeted band in the second half of the year.  Leu Drops  Romania\u2019s currency and bonds have rallied this year on\nincreased demand from international investors after JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and Barclays Plc included some of the country\u2019s\nsecurities in their government-debt indexes last month.  The leu, eastern  Europe \u2019s best performer this year against\nthe euro, traded at 4.3212 in Bucharest, down 0.1 percent from\nyesterday\u2019s close, paring losses after the decision.  \u201cGiven recent improvements in fundamental factors, under a\nfavorable disinflation perspective, a more benign exchange-rate\nenvironment and a still-negative output gap, the room for the\ncentral bank to start an easing cycle has enlarged,\u201d Catalina\nMolnar, chief economist at UniCredit Tiriac Bank SA, said today\nby e-mail. \u201cA bold decision for the National Bank would be to\nbring the key rate down to 4.5 percent by year-end. However any\ndeterioration in perspectives in the short run could maintain\nthe wait-and-see mode.\u201d  Regional Trend  The bank cut the overnight Lombard rate to 8.25 percent\nfrom 9.25 percent and raised the deposit-facility rate to 2.25\npercent from 1.25 percent. It left its minimum  reserve\nrequirements  on foreign-exchange deposits at 20 percent and the\nratio for leu deposits at 15 percent.  Romania can accelerate reductions in its main interest\nrate, joining other eastern European nations, because inflation\nis easing quicker than previously thought, Isarescu said.  Neighboring Hungary cut its main rate to a record-low 4.75\npercent on April 23 to help its economy emerge from a recession\nas the inflation rate stood at 2.2 percent in March, the lowest\nin almost 39 years.  Poland \u2019s central bank also reduced its\nbenchmark seven-day  reference rate  to 3.25 percent on March 6.\nThe  Czech Republic  has kept the rate at 0.05 percent since last\nNovember and is expected to remain on hold at today\u2019s meeting,\naccording to a Bloomberg survey of 18 economists.  Romania\u2019s inflation rate, the EU\u2019s highest, fell more than\nestimated in March to 5.25 percent from 5.65 percent in\nFebruary. The central bank has cut this year\u2019s 3.5 percent\n forecast for price growth  as demand waned, Isarescu said,\nwithout specifying the new estimate.  The central bank, whose end-2013 target range is 1.5\npercent to 3.5 percent, will release revised projections May 8.  \u201cWe are currently looking for inflation to slope downwards\nmore markedly in the second half of the year, following a more\nauspicious agricultural year,\u201d Banca Comerciala Romana SA\neconomist Dumitru Dulgheru wrote in a note after the decision.  Romania avoided a recession last quarter as gross domestic\nproduct rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4 percent from the previous\nthree months. The economy is set to grow 1.6 percent this year,\naccording to the European Commission.
