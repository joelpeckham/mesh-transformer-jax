The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFiat Industrial SpA (FI)  Chairman  Sergio Marchionne  won support from  CNH Global NV (CNH)  for an improved bid to\ncombine the tractor and truck makers and shift their focus to\nthe U.S. from  Europe .  CNH \u201cviews favorably the latest enhanced offer,\u201d a board\ncommittee evaluating the proposal said in a statement today.\n\u201cThe special committee has directed its advisers to work with\nFiat Industrial to negotiate definitive documentation.\u201d Fiat\nIndustrial aims for a final merger deal by Nov. 25.  The new company will have its primary listing in New York\nand keep Milan as a secondary listing, said a person familiar\nwith the deal, who asked not to be identified before an official\nannouncement.  Fiat Industrial, which already owns 88 percent of CNH,\nraised its offer for the rest of the tractor maker by 26 percent\non Nov. 19 after the Amsterdam-based company spurned an earlier\nproposal. The maker of Iveco trucks, which was spun off from\n Fiat SpA (F)  in 2011, boosted its bid with a $10-per-share special\ndividend for CNH owners, which will get 3.828 shares in the\nmerged entity for each share they own. Fiat Industrial investors\nwill swap their stock one for one.  \u201cIt\u2019s been above board, reasonably quick and the extra\npaid seems pretty fair,\u201d said  Max Warburton , a Bernstein\nResearch analyst in  London  with an outperform rating on the\nshares. \u201cBoth sides get a more liquid, clearer equity story, so\nI think everyone wanted to see this get done.\u201d  Shares Gain  Marchionne, who\u2019s targeting more than 25 billion euros ($32\nbillion) in sales for Fiat Industrial this year, is seeking to\ncreate in the combination the world\u2019s third-largest capital-\ngoods company, which won\u2019t use Fiat in its name. The merged\nentity would have a product range spanning Iveco delivery\ntrucks, New Holland harvesters and FPT ship engines.  Fiat Industrial  rose  as much as 14 cents, or 1.7 percent,\nto 8.54 euros and was up 1.1 percent as of 12:56 p.m. in Milan.\nThe stock has gained 28 percent this year, valuing the company\nat 10.4 billion euros. CNH closed down 4 cents at $47.50 in  New\nYork  yesterday, valuing the tractor maker at $11.4 billion.  The remaining 12 percent CNH stake is worth $1.37 billion\nat the current  market price . The special dividend for the\nholding totals $278 million. CNH last month rejected Fiat\nIndustrial\u2019s proposal to combine the two in a share exchange\nwith no premium for  CNH investors  as \u201cinadequate.\u201d  Reorganizing  \u201cIt is gratifying for both companies to take this step,\nwhich should enable CNH to put in place plans to pay the\nextraordinary dividend to CNH minority shareholders by the end\nof this year,\u201d Marchionne said today in a statement.  Fiat Industrial is reorganizing in response to the debt\ncrisis in Europe. Its Iveco truck unit announced plans in July\nto shut five plants in Europe by the end of 2012 because of the\nsovereign-debt crisis in the region.  CNH CEO Richard Tobin was appointed chief operating officer\nfor Fiat Industrial to help with the integration. JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. and  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  advised the CNH committee.  \u201cCNH gave its green light and this bring back the focus on\nfundamentals,\u201d said Massimo Vecchio, an analyst for Mediobanca\nin Milan.
