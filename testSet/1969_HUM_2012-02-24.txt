(HUM) ,  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) \nand other businesses running Medicare managed-care plans may\nhave to refund the government as much as $370 million next year\nif audits find the companies were overpaid.  About 11 percent of government payments to the health plans\nwere erroneous in 2011, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services said today without naming the companies.\nGovernment auditors of 30 unspecified plans will examine whether\nclinical records justify payments for medical services.  \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely confident that this is a valid sample to\ndo these audits,\u201d said  Jonathan Blum , deputy administrator of\nMedicare, in a telephone interview.  About 25 percent of the 45 million Americans enrolled in\nMedicare belong to private Medicare Advantage plans, which are\npaid a fixed fee to provide the program\u2019s traditional insurance\nbenefits along with extras such as gym memberships and\neyeglasses.  UnitedHealth, based in  Minnetonka ,  Minnesota , had the most\nMedicare Advantage customers in the fourth quarter, with 2.2\nmillion, followed by Louisville, Kentucky-based Humana, with 1.9\nmillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The government estimates it may have overpaid the industry\nas much as $12.4 billion last year. The 11 percent error rate\nfor private plans compares with an 8.6 percent rate in\ntraditional Medicare, the government said.  Each audit will examine the medical records of 200 patients\nand calculate the percentage of improper payments, Blum said.\nMedicare will recoup any overpayment by reducing future payouts\nto the companies, he said.  Medicare decided to only audit one year\u2019s worth of claims,\ninstead of looking back as far as 2007 as it initially proposed\na year ago, Blum said.
