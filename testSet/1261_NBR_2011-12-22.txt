The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSaudi Arabian Oil Co. plans to\nincrease its drilling-rig count by 12 percent next year to 145\nto boost natural-gas and oil output from its Manifa field, a\nformer executive of state-run company said.  Most of the expansion is for gas development, Sadad al- Husseini said today by e-mail. Al-Husseini was executive vice\npresident for exploration and development at the company known\nas  Saudi Aramco . He founded and runs  Husseini Energy , an\nindependent energy consultant in Dhahran,  Saudi Arabia .  Saudi Aramco will drill for gas onshore in northern Saudi\nArabia and near the Shaybah oil field in the Empty Quarter\ndesert, as well as offshore in Hasbah field in the Persian Gulf,\nsaid al-Husseini. The company will have 50 drilling rigs for\noil, 50 for gas, 15 exploration rigs and 30 workover rigs to\nmaintain existing wells next year, he said.  The oil drilling is mainly to \u201creplace capacity declines\nthat result from ongoing production\u201d and \u201cwill not add new\ncapacity, except for the Manifa drilling,\u201d al-Husseini said.  Saudi Aramco increased the number of drilling rigs this\nyear to 130, more than figures given out by rig contractors,\naccording to al-Husseini. The nation currently pumps around 10\nmillion barrels a day of crude, he said.  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  Chief Executive Officer Chad Deaton said\nin March that Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest crude exporter,\nis increasing the number of its drilling rigs by the end of this\nyear to 118 from 92.  Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR) , the world\u2019s largest\nonshore drilling contractor, had 30 rigs in the kingdom at the\nend of the first quarter this year and said in March it held\ntalks with Saudi Aramco to add more rigs.  Manifa Output  Saudi Aramco is increasing the number of drilling rigs in\nits Manifa field to 20 next year from the current eight, al-\nHusseini said. The company will spend about $17 billion\ndeveloping the giant field, located in shallow water in the\n Persian Gulf , to bring the full field development 10 years ahead\nof its planned schedule, Saudi Aramco\u2019s Chief Executive Officer\nKhalid Al-Falih said in Doha, Qatar, on Dec. 6. The field will\nstart production in 2013, he said.  Manifa, the world\u2019s fifth-largest oil field, is expected to\nproduce 500,000 barrels of Arabian Heavy crude oil in 2013 and\n900,000 barrels a day by 2015, according to the company\u2019s annual\nreview. Aramco\u2019s Manifa oil field development is aimed at\nmaintaining the company\u2019s production at 12 million barrels a day\nas it slows output from older fields, al-Falih told the  al-Hayat \ndaily newspaper on Dec. 13.  Rig-Count Estimates  No one at Saudi Aramco\u2019s headquarter in Dhahran could be\nreached for comment on the rig-count increase, as Thursday is\nthe start of the weekend in the country.  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  won a contract from Saudi Aramco in 2008 to\ndrill for oil in the offshore part of Manifa field. Halliburton\nsaid in April that Saudi Aramco was planning to increase the rig\ncount by approximately 30 percent in 2012 from its levels at the\nbeginning of the year, with 60 percent of this increase to be\nassigned to the Manifa project. The project was delayed due to\nthe global recession, Halliburton said.
