 "context": "The following article called 'SocGen Profit More Than Doubles on Investment Bank' was published on 2013-08-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSociete Generale  SA,  France \u2019s second-largest bank, said second-quarter profit more than doubled,\nbeating analysts\u2019 estimates, helped by a surge in corporate and\n investment-banking  revenue.  Societe Generale rose as much as 5.9 percent in Paris\ntrading after saying net income rose to 955 million euros ($1.27\nbillion), exceeding the 668 million-euro average forecast of six\nanalysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue at the corporate- and\ninvestment-banking unit rose 38 percent from the previous year.  Societe Generale, led by Chief Executive Officer  Frederic Oudea , is selling assets and has cut hundreds of jobs in\ninvestment banking to comply with stricter capital rules\ndesigned to ensure the financial crisis of 2008 is not repeated.\nIn May, it announced 900 million euros of cost reductions\nthrough 2015 to restore profitability.  \u201cWhat we are doing in terms of profitability and capital\nratios is really going in the right direction at a quick pace,\u201d\nOudea said in a Bloomberg Television interview after the\nearnings were published. The bank\u2019s core Tier 1 capital ratio\nwill be \u201cclose to\u201d 10 percent by year\u2019s end and a rights issue\nis \u201cnot at all\u201d needed, he said.  Societe Generale rose 5.6 percent to 31.91 euros by 9:22\na.m., bringing this year\u2019s gains to 13 percent for a market\nvalue of about 25.5 billion euros. The Bloomberg  Europe  Banks &\nFinancial Services Index rose 9.4 percent in the period.  BNP\nParibas SA (BNP) , France\u2019s largest bank, which beat analysts\u2019\nexpectations yesterday with a second-quarter profit of 1.76\nbillion euros, rose 16 percent this year.  Leverage Prediction  Societe Generale said its leverage ratio, or common equity\nas a proportion of total assets, will exceed 3 percent by the\nend of the year, the minimum level set by global regulators for\nthe start of 2018, under the current understanding of Basel\ncommittee rules. It didn\u2019t provide a figure for the ratio should\nthe calculations be enhanced as many analysts predict.  The core equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III, another key\nmeasure of banks\u2019 financial strength that is based on risk-weighting of assets, was 9.4 percent at the end of June, a gain\nof 73 basis points, or 0.73 percentage point, from the end of\nMarch, Societe Generale said. The ratio will increase to more\nthan 9.5 percent by year-end, it said.  Regulators are questioning the risk weightings banks apply\nto their assets, which are typically set by the lenders\u2019 own\nmodels, and calling for inclusion of the more simplified measure\nof leverage that ignores risk.  BNP, which is planning to expand in markets such as  Germany \nand the Asia-Pacific region, had a  leverage ratio  of 3.4 percent\nat the end of June, based on core Tier 1 capital.  Investment Banking  Net income at Societe Generale\u2019s corporate- and investment-bank surged to 374 million euros from 131 million euros in the\nsecond quarter of last year, beating the 354 million-euro\naverage estimate of five analysts. Global-markets revenue rose\n27 percent to 1.2 billion euros in the period.  Societe Generale\u2019s equities-trading business benefited from\n\u201cstrong revenues on flow equity derivatives\u201d in  Asia  and from\n\u201csustained commercial activity on structured products,\u201d it\nsaid in a presentation.  Trading in fixed-income, currencies and commodities had\nseen \u201cgrowing demand from retail and institutional clients on\nstructured products,\u201d the bank said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup\nInc.,  Bank of America Corp . and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  reported a\ncumulative 24 percent gain in revenue at their investment banks\nfrom the year-earlier quarter, excluding own debt valuations,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  Private Banking  Societe Generale had 84 million euros in second-quarter net\nincome from its private banking and investment-management\nservices unit, compared with a 129 million-euro loss in the\nprevious year, when it booked a 200 million-euro markdown on a\nU.S. asset-management unit.  France\u2019s three largest banks, which also include  Credit\nAgricole SA (ACA) , last year shrank risk-weighted assets by a combined\n128 billion euros and cut thousands of investment-banking jobs\nto comply with stricter international capital and liquidity\nrequirements.  Now French lenders are seeking to counter the impact of the\nEuropean economic slump. President  Francois Hollande \u2019s\ngovernment is prodding banks to lend more to help France emerge\nfrom a recession, while cutting them some slack on other fronts.\nFrench banks were spared a split of lucrative investment-banking\nactivities from other operations as lawmakers passed a bill last\nmonth to segregate proprietary trading, the first such move in\nEurope.  France Profit  Net income at Societe Generale\u2019s French retail banking unit\nfell 11 percent to 319 million euros in the second quarter, it\nsaid. That surpassed the 301 million-euro average estimate of\nfive analysts. Revenue rose 1.6 percent to 2.07 billion euros\nwhile provisions for doubtful loans were at 274 million euros, a\n29 percent increase from a year ago, it said.  Societe Generale (GLE) \u2019s second-quarter net income from  Russia \nwas 10 million million euros, rebounding from a year-earlier\nloss of 271 million euros caused by a writedown at its Moscow-based unit OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , the bank said. Societe Generale serves\nabout 5 million Russian clients, its second-biggest market after\nFrance, and is among a declining number of Western banks keeping\na presence in Russia after rivals such as  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  HSBC\nHoldings Plc (HSBA)  left.  In June, Societe Generale pledged to keep growing its\nRussian business as it sought to move beyond the May arrest of\nRosbank\u2019s former head on bribery charges. It said in June that\nit aims to achieve return on equity of more than 15 percent in\nRussia by 2015.  Societe Generale\u2019s corporate center, which includes the\ngroup\u2019s property portfolio, its banking and industrial equity\nholdings and treasury functions, had a net loss of 78 million\neuros compared with a year-earlier 138 million-euro profit, the\nbank said. The division booked 100 million euros in litigation\nprovisions, it said.
