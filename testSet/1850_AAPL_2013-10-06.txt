 "context": "The following article called 'Samsung Seeks U.S. Veto of Import Ban Just Like Apple Got' was published on 2013-10-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSamsung Electronics Co. (005930)  wants the same favor from President  Barack Obama  that he gave U.S.-based  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  -- the right to keep importing smartphones and tablets found to infringe the other\u2019s patents.  Unless the White House overturns an import ban against Samsung for infringing two Apple patents, the world\u2019s biggest maker of smartphones will see certain older models locked out of the U.S. at midnight Oct. 8 Washington time.  The administration\u2019s been in this position before. On Aug. 3, it overturned an import ban won by Samsung against older versions of Apple\u2019s iPhone 4 and iPad 2 3G. The two companies are the biggest players in the $279.9 billion global smartphone market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung says blocking one competitor\u2019s products while letting another\u2019s remain on the U.S. market could be seen as pro-American bias.  \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating for Samsung -- they won a big victory against Apple or so they thought,\u201d said  Jim Altman , of Foster, Murphy, Altman & Nickel in  Washington , who represents Asian companies at the U.S. International Trade Commission, which issued the import ban. \u201cThe president gets rid of it. And then Apple wins a victory and the president says \u2018tough cookies\u2019?\u201d  Samsung, which reported record third-quarter profit based on sales of its smartphones Oct. 4, has said any ban will involve a small number of handsets. It sold 32 percent of all smartphones worldwide in the second quarter, compared with 13 percent for Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u2018Favoritism, Protectionism\u2019  \u201cThe world is watching how Samsung is treated by the United States in this \u2018smartphone war,\u2019\u201d Samsung wrote Aug. 28 to Obama\u2019s designee to review the case, U.S. Trade Representative  Michael Froman . \u201cThe administration has a significant interest in avoiding the perception of favoritism and protectionism toward U.S. companies.\u201d  Froman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday in Bali,  Indonesia , that he hasn\u2019t decided yet whether to issue Samsung a reprieve. He said he has made \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d to the company and the South Korean government that decisions have \u201cnothing, zero, to do with the nationality of the parties involved.\u201d The decisions are made based on \u201cpolicy judgments\u201d over patents and \u201cthe appropriate use of exclusion orders in these cases,\u201d he said.  Foreign companies are often concerned the U.S. legal system favors American companies, Altman said.  \u201cI\u2019ve never seen any evidence of xenophobia or \u2018Get the foreigners\u2019 or \u2018Protect the Americans,\u2019\u201d Altman said of patent disputes at the commission.  Obama has the power to overturn import bans issued by the ITC on public policy grounds. The administration\u2019s decision can\u2019t be appealed, while companies can take the underlying patent-infringement finding to an appeals court.  Functionality Versus Features  Jung Dong Joon, a patent lawyer with SU Intellectual Property in  Seoul , says it\u2019s unlikely Samsung will succeed.  \u201cThere\u2019s a little chance that the U.S. government will veto this time amid the government shutdown there now,\u201d Jung said. \u201cSamsung may have to take comfort from the fact that those that will be banned are old products.\u201d  The cases against Apple and Samsung are different.  In rejecting an import ban on the iPhone models, Froman cited the Obama administration\u2019s stated interest in limiting use of industry standards patents to block competitors. The Samsung patent involves a standard for transmitting data over networks.  In the Samsung case, the Apple patents are for features that the Cupertino, California-based company says differentiate the iPhone from other smartphones -- multitouch technology and headphone-jack detection. Samsung must persuade the White House that other public policy concerns are just as important.  Complex Devices  Samsung\u2019s other arguments focus on two key issues -- an import ban shouldn\u2019t be imposed when it involves one or two features of complex devices, and the ITC\u2019s broad wording could lead to non-infringing products being halted at the border.  \u201cCourts, scholars and industry participants agree that granting injunctive relief over an entire product based on the infringement of one or a few of these features disproportionately rewards the patentee at the expense of U.S. consumers,\u201d Samsung told the trade representative.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, which hears all patent appeals, is considering the standard for blocking sales of multifunction products after a jury finds a few features infringe patents. The ITC, which protects U.S. markets from unfair trade practices, doesn\u2019t always follow the same rules as courts.  A federal judge in  California  allowed Samsung smartphones to remain on the market in 2012 after deciding the Apple patents at trial -- different from what the trade agency considered -- didn\u2019t cover features that drove sales.  Design Around  Apple says it keeps and entices new customers by contrasting the look and ease of the iPhone, so it needs to stop competitors from copying those ideas. It told the appeals court that Samsung\u2019s position is inconsistent -- it says the features are unimportant and yet wants to continue using them.  Since the Apple patents involved in the import ban cover features and not standards, Samsung was able to successfully design around those inventions, the ITC found. Those phones should be allowed to enter the U.S. unimpeded.  \u201cThe volume of products actually affected by the commission\u2019s orders is perhaps small,\u201d Samsung wrote.  Samsung reported operating profit rose to about 10.1 trillion won ($9.4 billion) in the three months ended September, citing demand in  China ,  India  and the Middle East for low-cost Galaxy smartphones. The company, which also makes washing machines, computer chips and televisions, didn\u2019t provide a breakdown of division earnings.  \u2018Little Impact\u2019  In addition to being Apple\u2019s biggest competitor, Samsung also is one of Apple\u2019s largest component suppliers. Eventually, the companies will have to reach an agreement.  \u201cThe market changes really fast while the patent fight takes longer, which is why any litigation fight has little impact on the market,\u201d said Jeong Woo Sung, a patent lawyer at Lim@Jeong Patent Law Firm in Seoul. \u201cSamsung may feel a bit ashamed, but Samsung should more actively seek an exit plan to end the dispute for its business with Apple in the long run.\u201d  The Apple case against Samsung is In the Matter of Electronic Digital Media Devices, 337-796, and Samsung\u2019s case is In the Matter of Electronic Devices, Including Wireless Communication Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing Devices, and Tablet Computers, 337-794, both U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington).
