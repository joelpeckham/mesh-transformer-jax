 "context": "The following article called 'Mall of America Boosts Security After Attack in Nairobi' was published on 2013-09-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMall of America, the largest U.S.\nshopping  center  and entertainment complex, said it\u2019s increasing\nsecurity after Islamist militants attacked a Kenyan mall,\nkilling at least 67 civilians.  The suburban Minneapolis mall, owned by real estate\ndevelopment and finance company Triple Five Group of  Edmonton ,\n Alberta , is monitoring the news from Nairobi and working with\n law-enforcement  agencies, the center\u2019s management said today in\nan e-mailed statement. The Bloomington, Minnesota, property,\nwhich opened in 1992, has more than 520 stores, an indoor\namusement park, an aquarium and a movie theater.  \u201cMall of America has implemented extra security\nprecautions,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cSome may be\nnoticeable to guests, and others won\u2019t be. We will continue to\nfollow the situation, along with law enforcement, and will\nremain vigilant as we always do in similar situations.\u201d  U.S. mall owners face the challenge of protecting sprawling\nproperties filled with hundreds of people without disrupting\nbusiness. After an attack such as the one in Nairobi, the\n companies  may ask local police for patrol cars at their\nproperties or bring in additional security officers, said\nMalachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for the  International Council of\nShopping Centers , a  New York-based trade group.  The death toll from the four-day assault is the worst since\nal-Qaeda bombed the U.S. Embassy in downtown Nairobi in August\n1998, killing 213 people. Three floors in the building collapsed\nduring the attack, leaving an unknown number of bodies buried\nbeneath the rubble, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said\nyesterday.  \u2018Reasonably Secure\u2019  Security at shopping centers varies by country and the\nperceived threat level for potential attacks, Kavanagh said.  \u201cMost malls are reasonably secure, given their mission\nthat they have to cater to the public,\u201d William Nesbitt,\npresident of Security Management Services International Inc., a\nNewbury Park, California-based consulting firm, said in a phone\ninterview. \u201cBasically malls need to be open to the public.\u201d  Some U.S. malls, because they\u2019re often among the largest\nbuildings in a city and heavily trafficked, have a police\nofficer on site, Kavanagh said. Retail centers may house police\nsubstations as well.  The Bloomington Police Department has a substation in Mall\nof America, according to the property\u2019s website. The center\u2019s\nsecurity force has been the subject of a reality television\nprogram, \u201cMall Cops: Mall of America,\u201d on the TLC cable\nnetwork.  \u2018Top Priority\u2019  Mall of America didn\u2019t disclose details of its security\nplans.  General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the second-largest U.S.\nmall owner, doesn\u2019t discuss specific parts of its safety\nprograms \u201cin order to avoid compromising our efforts,\u201d said\n David Keating , a spokesman for the Chicago-based company.  \u201cThe safety and security of our shoppers, retailers and\nemployees are always a top priority, not just when tragedies\noccur,\u201d he said in an e-mail  Les Morris, a spokesman for Indianapolis-based  Simon\nProperty Group Inc. (SPG) , the world\u2019s largest mall owner, and Katy Dickey, a Los Angeles-based spokeswoman for  Westfield Group (WDC) ,\ndeclined to comment on their companies\u2019 security measures.
