The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMacquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia\u2019s\nlargest investment bank, has bought two natural gas-fed power\nstations in the U.K. in a bet that profit from burning the fuel\nwill rise after three years of declines.  Macquarie purchased the 540-megawatt Baglan Bay plant in\n Wales  from General Electric Co. in October, Nicole Grove, a\nspokeswoman for the bank in London, said by e-mail yesterday. It\nacquired the 819-megawatt Sutton Bridge facility in eastern\nEngland from Electricite de France SA last month. The profit\nfrom burning gas next month, known as the clean-spark spread,\nfell 21 percent last year after dropping 48 percent in 2011 and\n29 percent in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks such as  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Deutsche Bank AG and  UBS AG (UBSN) \nhave scaled back their energy and commodities teams in the past\nyear as they try to cut costs. Utilities including  GDF Suez SA (GSZ) \nhave closed, mothballed or delayed at least 3.8 gigawatts of\ngas-fed generation capacity in the past two years in the U.K.\nand Germany, enough to power about 7.6 million European homes,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cForward spark spreads are very low out to 2015 so a gas\nplant buyer must be taking a longer term view that spreads will\nimprove,\u201d  Lakis Athanasiou , an independent equity analyst in\nLondon, said by phone on Jan. 14. Sutton Bridge has an\nenterprise value of about 160 million pounds ($256 million)\nwhile Baglan Bay may be worth 150 million pounds, he said.  The  next-month spark spread  was at 1.82 pounds a megawatt-\nhour today, down from 2.47 pounds on the same date last year and\nas much as 11.47 pounds in October 2009.  Baglan Bay has been halted since Oct. 27 while Sutton\nBridge was generating 804 megawatts at 8 a.m. in London,\n National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Macquarie hired Dan Briggs in September and Suthagar \u2018Sid\u2019 Rajeswaran in January as natural gas and power operations\nanalysts for the bank\u2019s energy trading team in  London .
