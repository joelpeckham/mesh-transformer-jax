 "context": "The following article called 'Worst Shipping Crisis Ever Near End as Nordea Sees Loan Growth' was published on 2013-09-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNordea Bank AB (NDA) , Scandinavia\u2019s\nbiggest lender, said the shipping industry will next year begin\nto recover from its worst crisis on record as global demand\npicks up and freight rates and asset prices recover.  While \u201c2013 will be another tough year in most segments,\nsometime in 2014 we\u2019ll probably start seeing a gradual\nimprovement in the broader market,\u201d Hans Kjelsrud, the Oslo-based head of Nordea\u2019s shipping unit, said in a Sept. 17\ntelephone interview. \u201cOnce we get through this year, deliveries\nof new ships will be a lot lower. We believe 2014 will be better\nthan 2013 and that 2015 will be better than 2014.\u201d  Nordea, the world\u2019s fifth-biggest shipping bank, has\nremained loyal to an industry suffering from its worst-ever\nslump as other European banks, including Commerzbank AG, have\npulled out. The shipping industry, now in its fifth year of\ncrisis, has suffered from slumping demand and overcapacity in\nthe wake of  Europe \u2019s debt crisis and from low freight rates,\nhigh fuel prices and slumping asset values.  The ClarkSea Index, a measure of industry-wide earnings,\naveraged $9,187 a day this year, the lowest since 1990,\naccording to shipbroker Clarkson Plc. The fleets of dry-bulk\ncarriers and supertankers are both the most oversupplied since\nthe 1980s, according to Clarkson and Fearnley Consultants AS, a\nmaritime research company in Oslo. There are now signs of\nimprovement as the global economy picks up, Kjelsrud said.  Ship Values  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now is that the U.S. seems to be\nfirming up and while there were some uncertainties about  China \nearlier in the year, it seems to be doing OK,\u201d Kjelsrud said.\n\u201cEurope seems to at least have hit the bottom.\u201d  Global economic growth \u201cobviously increases the volumes of\ncargo being shipped and historically, if  freight rates  start to\nfirm up and increase, that will also at some point drive ship\nvalues,\u201d Kjelsrud said.  Ship values rose 2.9 percent in August, the biggest\nincrease since February 2011, according to a Clarkson index of\nsecond-hand prices across all vessels. The gauge is heading for\nits first annual gain since 2007.  The price of a five-year-old Capesize, the largest type of\nbulk carrier, rose 14 percent to $33.5 million this year,\nheading for the first gain since 2010, according to the  Baltic\nExchange . Values for such ships collapsed from as much as $153.8\nmillion in 2008 to $29.5 million early this year, their lowest\nprice in at least 10 years.  Loan Losses  \u201cWhat we have seen is that newbuilding prices have firmed\nup a little bit in the last three to six months and at some\npoint that will probably also spill over to the ship values,\nespecially for modern ships,\u201d Kjelsrud said. \u201cFor the time\nbeing and based on what we have seen, second-hand values seem to\nhave bottomed out in most major segments.\u201d  An improvement in asset values helps limit credit losses at\nshipping banks. Loan losses at Nordea\u2019s shipping unit slid 15\npercent in the second quarter from the first, hitting the lowest\nratio since the third quarter of 2011. Operating profit grew to\na seven-quarter high and loan losses at the bank\u2019s maritime\nbusiness will probably drop further, Nordea Chief Executive\nOfficer  Christian Clausen  said in July.  DNB ASA (DNB) , the world\u2019s third-biggest shipping bank, reported\nsecond-quarter loan losses of 198 million kroner ($34 million)\nat its shipping, offshore and logistics division. That was a 43\npercent drop from the first three months of the year and the\nlowest in four quarters, according to its website.  The improvement has resulted in banks returning to the ship\nfinancing market. Nordea has \u201cstarted to see more activity on\nthe lending side from shipping banks,\u201d Kjelsrud said, adding\nthat there is \u201cmore liquidity out there now.\u201d That is vital\nfor the development of ship prices, he said.  \u201cWithout financing, it\u2019s very hard to have a well-functioning sale and purchase market,\u201d Kjelsrud said. \u201cThat\u2019s\nimportant in terms of asset values. In order to buy a ship you\nneed financing and when that dries up the activity in the sale\nand purchase market also dries up.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nNiklas Magnusson in Stockholm at \n nmagnusson1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTasneem Brogger at \n tbrogger@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was 14.009689331054688 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was ",
