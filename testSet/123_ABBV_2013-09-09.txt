 "context": "The following article called 'Death Every 10 Seconds Spurs Novartis, Glaxo Lung Contest' was published on 2013-09-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThere\u2019s a new competition brewing in\nthe $10 billion market for drugs to treat  deadly lung diseases \nas the growing number of smokers in emerging markets drives\ndemand.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  aims to convince doctors that its new Ultibro\nmedicine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is better\nthan  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) \u2019s blockbuster Advair, which is also\nused to treat asthma. Glaxo, meanwhile, has developed new\nproducts in anticipation of the day that Advair faces\ncompetition from generic copies.  The illness, also known as smokers\u2019 cough, kills a person\nevery 10 seconds and will become the  third leading cause of\ndeath  worldwide by 2030, according to the World Health\nOrganization and Brentford, U.K.-based Glaxo. Conditions known\nas chronic bronchitis and emphysema are both included in the\nCOPD diagnosis. While asthma affects more people globally, it\ndoesn\u2019t kill on the scale of COPD, according to the WHO.  \u201cThe disease is massively out there,\u201d said  Richard\nRussell , a COPD specialist at Wexham Park Hospital in southeast\n England  who says he sees six or seven new patients every week.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting new patients all the time with advanced\ndisease who have never received treatment.\u201d  While the proportion of smokers among the global population\nhas been steadily falling, the number of COPD cases will\ncontinue to rise because of the delayed appearance of symptoms\nand growing numbers of smokers in  emerging markets , especially\n China , drug makers say. Though pollution exacerbates COPD,\nsmoking is the main driver.  \u2018Global Epidemic\u2019  The market for COPD medicines may rise to $14 billion in\n2018 from $10 billion this year, Citigroup Inc. analysts\nestimate. Including asthma, the respiratory market will total\nmore than $30 billion, according to Bloomberg Industries.  COPD is characterized by breathlessness, excess saliva and\nmucus in the airways and a chronic cough. About 65 million\npeople globally have moderate to severe COPD, according to the\n WHO . Current rates of smoking in China suggest a future patient\npopulation of at least 75 million, Bloomberg Industries\nestimated.  \u201cCOPD is a global epidemic and a growing problem in both\nthe developed world and in emerging markets,\u201d said David\nMorris, Novartis\u2019s global head of primary care development,\nincluding respiratory disease. \u201cWe see this as a sustained\ninvestment.\u201d  Advair Sales  The European Union\u2019s drug regulator on July 26 recommended\nthat the European Commission approve Ultibro for COPD. The\ncommission usually follows the regulator\u2019s advice. Basel,\nSwitzerland-based Novartis has said it plans to file for\napproval in the U.S. at the end of next year.  Advair, marketed as Seretide in most countries outside the\nU.S., was  Glaxo\u2019s best-selling drug  last year, with 5.05 billion\npounds ($8 billion) in sales, split about evenly between asthma\nand COPD. It\u2019s been on the market for more than a decade and was\nthe world\u2019s third-best-selling medicine last year behind  AbbVie\nInc. (ABBV) \u2019s Humira and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Remicade, which both treat\narthritis.  Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH\u2019s Spiriva, the biggest-selling\ndrug for COPD, had sales of 3.6 billion euros ($4.7 billion)\nlast year. Patients typically take Advair or Spiriva or both.\n AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) \u2019s Symbicort had $3.2 billion of sales last year.  Latent demand also lies in the reluctance of smokers to\nvisit doctors about their conditions, Russell said.  Advair\u2019s Patent  \u201cThey don\u2019t want to come to us, because they think they\u2019re\ngoing to get nagged about smoking,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole\nconcept of early treatment and diagnosis is still in its\ninfancy.\u201d  The patent on Advair expired in 2010 in the U.S., the\nworld\u2019s largest drug market. A separate patent on the Diskus\ndevice used to inhale the medicine remains in force through\n2016.  While copying Advair and its delivery device will be\ndifficult, Novartis\u2019s generics division, Sandoz, probably will\nbe the first to succeed, followed by  Actavis Inc. (ACT)  and Mylan\nInc., according to analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  As a result, Glaxo and competitors have been racing to\ndevelop follow-up products. Some from Novartis, Glaxo and\n Almirall SA (ALM)  have won regulatory approval recently.  Given Advair\u2019s dominant position, the new products may face\ndifficulty gaining acceptance by doctors and reimbursement\nauthorities, according to experts.  Stock Performance  \u201cIf there\u2019s no obvious clinical benefit over existing\ntreatments and if there\u2019s no significant cost savings to be had,\nthen all of these drugs will struggle,\u201d said Russell, who\nconsults for drugmakers including Glaxo, Novartis, Boehringer\nand Almirall.  Still, the new-product approvals have helped the companies\u2019\nshares  outperform rivals  this year. Glaxo and Novartis have each\nrisen 23 percent, while the Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical\nIndex has risen 14 percent.  Glaxo\u2019s Breo Ellipta, which was approved in May in the U.S.\nas a once-daily drug, showed no statistical difference to\nAdvair, which is taken twice a day, in a late-stage study,\naccording to the company.  Breo and Advair both contain a steroid to reduce\ninflammation and a so-called LABA bronchodilator, which relaxes\nthe airways in the lungs. While Glaxo has highlighted the\nconvenience of once-daily dosing, that may not be enough to\npersuade insurance companies and governments to pay the cost,\nsaid  John Hurst,  senior lecturer in respiratory medicine at\n University College London .  \u2018Marketing Machine\u2019  \u201cI don\u2019t buy once-daily being a life-changing step\nforward,\u201d said Hurst, who conducts research with Glaxo,\nNovartis and Boehringer, among others. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much more\nconvenient that I would be prepared to pay more money for it.\u201d  Glaxo declined to comment on the price of Breo relative to\nAdvair.  Glaxo does have an advantage given its decade-long\nexperience selling Advair, Russell said.  Among doctors, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of familiarity with Glaxo,\nand the Glaxo marketing machine is very powerful,\u201d he said.  While Glaxo is mindful of the payer perspective and the\nneed to be realistic, the company is confident that once-daily\nis \u201ca compelling proposition\u201d for physicians, said Darrell\nBaker, head of Glaxo\u2019s respiratory drug development.  \u201cWe have a lot of research to back that up,\u201d he said.  Mortality Impact  What could turn heads is an on-going study that is\ninvestigating the impact of Breo on mortality in patients with\nmoderate COPD and with increased heart disease risk. Positive\nresults, which may be released in early 2015, could\n\u201ctransform\u201d the reimbursement outlook, Citigroup analysts said\nin a note earlier this month.  Spiriva is another type of bronchodilator that is often\ncombined with Advair for patients who still have trouble\nbreathing with single treatment. Among his patients taking\nAdvair, 80 percent also take Spiriva, Russell said.  Glaxo\u2019s Anoro and Novartis\u2019s Ultibro, which is administered\nby an inhaler called Breezhaler, are the first in a new class of\nCOPD drugs that combine both types of bronchodilators in a\nsingle device and leave out the steroid component contained in\nBreo, which in high doses has been linked to fatal pneumonia in\nstudies.  \u201cI\u2019m much more interested in that,\u201d Hurst said.  Anoro Decision  The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  will hold an advisory\ncommittee meeting on Anoro tomorrow, with a regulatory decision\nexpected in December. The drug showed strong efficacy at both\ndoses for which the company is seeking approval, FDA staff said\nin a report Sept. 6.  Glaxo, Novartis and Boehringer are among drugmakers\npresenting studies on COPD drugs at the European Respiratory\nSociety\u2019s annual meeting in Barcelona, concluding Sept. 11.  Anoro probably will lead the combination therapy market,\nwith sales reaching $1.7 billion by 2020, according to the\naverage of six  analyst estimates  surveyed by Bloomberg. Ultibro,\nwhose sales may reach $1.05 billion in 2020, may be hindered by\nthe Breezhaler device, which must be loaded with a new capsule\nafter each use, compared with Anoro\u2019s multi-dose Ellipta device,\naccording to analysts.  Given that Spiriva is also taken through a single-dose\ninhaler, patients are familiar with the concept, Novartis\u2019s\nMorris said.  \u201cThis device is very simple, very intuitive,\u201d he said.  Still, Glaxo is confident it will maintain its market-leading position with its range of products that can all be\ndelivered through Ellipta, Baker said.  Boehringer and Almirall are also developing their own\nLAMA/LABA combinations, which probably will reach the market by\n2015, according to Citigroup.  \u201cIs there a need for these new treatments? Absolutely,\u201d\nHurst said. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly prevalent condition, and despite the\nbest available treatments we have today, patients remain\nsymptomatic.\u201d  For Related News and Information:\nGlaxo-Theravance Lung Drug Shows Strong Efficacy, FDA Says (2)  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMakiko Kitamura in London at \n mkitamura1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nPhil Serafino at \n pserafino@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of AbbVie Inc. was 31.214548110961914 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of AbbVie Inc. was ",
