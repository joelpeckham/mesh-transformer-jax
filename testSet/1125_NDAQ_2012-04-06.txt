 "context": "The following article called 'Facebook to Nasdaq Gives CEO Greifeld a Victory Over NYSE' was published on 2012-04-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nScoring what may be the biggest\nlisting by a technology company ever will help  Robert Greifeld ,\nchief executive officer of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., forget about\nhis last clash with  NYSE Euronext (NYX) \u2019s  Duncan Niederauer .  Facebook Inc. (FB)  plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket, further cementing the exchange\u2019s position as the favored\nvenue for the biggest U.S. technology companies, a person with\nknowledge of the matter said yesterday. The person declined to\nbe named because the discussions are private. The social media\ngiant spurned the New York Stock Exchange, whose stocks have a\nmarket value about triple that of Nasdaq\u2019s companies.  The two biggest American exchange operators are rivals for\nvirtually every IPO in the country and competed for Facebook,\nwhich filed for a $5 billion initial public offering on Feb. 1.\nWinning the IPO would mean more fees, a boost in trading revenue\nand the chance to link an exchange\u2019s brand with the largest\nsocial-networking website in the world.  \u201cPeople are asking about what it means for NYSE to lose\nit, but it was critical for Nasdaq to win,\u201d  Richard Repetto , an\nanalyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP in New York, said in a\nphone interview. \u201cWhat it does is it keeps the momentum and\nlikely leads to further IPOs in the future. Whatever brand\nFacebook attracts, whether it\u2019s tech or social media, it likely\nhelps Nasdaq\u2019s cause.\u201d  Robert Madden, a Nasdaq OMX spokesman, declined to comment\non the decision. So did Jonathan Thaw of Facebook and  Rich Adamonis  of NYSE Euronext.  Blow to Niederauer  The decision is the latest blow to Niederauer, who saw his\nown attempt to merge with Deutsche Boerse AG fall apart when\nEuropean antitrust regulators blocked the deal. Shares of the\ncompany slid 13 percent in 2011, while  Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ)  climbed 3.3\npercent and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was little changed.  Greifeld will get bragging rights about luring Facebook\nafter his unsolicited attempt to acquire the New York Stock\nExchange parent in conjunction with IntercontinentalExchange\nInc. fizzled out when the  Justice Department  said last May it\nwould sue to block such a transaction. Niederauer was on the\nboard that rejected Greifeld\u2019s offer and referred to it as\n\u201cloosely worded and full of unanswered questions\u201d in an\ninterview with Bloomberg on April 10.  Nasdaq rose 1.2 percent to $25.52 yesterday, while NYSE\nEuronext fell 1.3 percent to $28.31.  Biggest Technology Companies  Nasdaq OMX lists seven of the 10 biggest U.S. technology\ncompanies by market value, including  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Microsoft\nCorp., the two largest, as well as  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Intel Corp .\nThe NYSE is the home venue for International Business Machines\nCorp., ranked third.  Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 Index may have spurred Facebook\ntoward Nasdaq, Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based Ipox\nSchuster LLC, which has about $2 billion tied to indexes that\ntrack IPOs, said in a phone interview. The benchmark gauge\ncomprises nonfinancial companies including Apple and Google.  The Nasdaq-100 has surged 165 percent since equity markets\nbottomed in March 2009, beating the 107 percent gain by the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  Should Facebook get a weighting of 4 percent to 5 percent\nin the Nasdaq-100, the PowerShares QQQ Trust exchange-traded\nfund that tracks the measure \u201ccould create $2 billion to $3\nbillion of systematic demand\u201d for the stock, Schuster said. The\nETF has a market value of $35.9 billion, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Other securities tracking the index would\nneed to make similar purchases.  \u2018Supportive\u2019 of Price  \u201cIt would be very supportive for the stock price and may\nbe one of the main reasons Facebook chose  Nasdaq ,\u201d Schuster\nsaid. \u201cThey\u2019d be with Microsoft, Yahoo and Apple. Being\nincluded would create demand no matter how expensive or cheap\nthe stock is.\u201d  While listings bring in less than a quarter of net revenue\nand even less of profit for NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, the\nexchanges fight for IPOs because it leads to more trading and\nbrand value, said  Larry Tabb , founder of financial-market\nresearch and advisory firm Tabb Group LLC. Listings accounted\nfor 17 percent of NYSE Euronext\u2019s net revenue last year and 19\npercent of Nasdaq OMX\u2019s.  Tabb said March 27 that Facebook\u2019s trading may translate\ninto about $500,000 to $1 million revenue per year, split among\nthe exchanges and other venues. That means that NYSE Euronext\nand Nasdaq OMX could get an additional $260,000 in trading and\nmarket data revenue alone.  \u201cIt\u2019s a huge prestige thing for the exchanges and I\u2019m sure\nNYSE is very disappointed, but I don\u2019t think it matters in terms\nof the exchange\u2019s share of trading,\u201d Mike Bleich, chief\nexecutive officer of Scout Trading LLC, a market-making firm in\n New York , said in a phone interview. Facebook \u201cwill trade\nacross a variety of exchange platforms as all other stocks do.\nThe particular platform they list on isn\u2019t special.\u201d  Percent of Trading  Markets owned by NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX had about 30\npercent of trading this year in shares listed on NYSE and\nNasdaq, respectively, according to data compiled by Barclays Plc\nin a report March 26. The NYSE owner accounted for 11.2 percent\nof volume in Nasdaq companies while Nasdaq OMX\u2019s venues had 16.8\npercent of trading in NYSE companies, the data showed.  Nasdaq OMX had more at stake because of the perception it\ngets all the technology companies, according to Sang Lee,\nmanaging partner at Boston-based Aite Group LLC. Among Internet\nIPOs since the beginning of 2011, LinkedIn Corp. and Pandora\nMedia Inc. picked NYSE, while Nasdaq won Groupon Inc. and Zynga\nInc.  \u2018Very Nice Position\u2019  \u201cHaving that brand name on that listings side would be\nhuge,\u201d Lee said of Facebook\u2019s selection. \u201cIf they\u2019re able to\ndo it correctly, the other social-media sites and players would\ncertainly be talking to Nasdaq initially,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would\ncertainly put them in a very nice position.\u201d  Facebook\u2019s decision follows Bats Global Markets Inc., the\nthird-largest U.S. exchange operator, withdrawing its IPO on\nMarch 23. Bats planned to compete with NYSE and Nasdaq in\ncorporate listings, making its own shares the first to call the\nBats BZX Exchange home. A computer bug prevented Bats from\ngetting its own shares to trade.  Facebook, based in  Menlo Park ,  California , filed Feb. 1 to\nraise $5 billion in the largest Internet IPO on record. The\namount was a placeholder used to calculate fees and may change.\nThe combined U.S. and German debut of Infineon Technologies AG\nin 2000 totaled about $5.85 billion, making it the biggest\ntechnology offering in history.  \u201cI think  Mark Zuckerberg  wants to be mentioned with the\nlikes of  Bill Gates ,  Michael Dell  and  Steve Jobs ,\u201d Philip Panaro, president and chief executive officer of IM2 Consulting\nLLC, said in an e-mail about Facebook\u2019s founder. He was an\nadviser to Nasdaq in the mid-1990s and to NYSE in 2004 and 2005.\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s culture and brand identity more closely align to\nthose names and their associated brands,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end\nof the day, I think it was all about legacy.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nNina Mehta in New York at \n nmehta24@bloomberg.net ;\nWhitney Kisling in New York at \n wkisling@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nNick Baker at \n nbaker7@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. was 21.684772491455078 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. was ",
