The firm hired RMR Advisors Ltd., started earlier this year\nin  London  by former UBS AG bankers Jamie Robinson, Deepak Rajan \nand Henrik Matsen, as consultants to build the European life\ninsurance and reinsurance unit, said the people, who asked not\nto be identified because the plan is private. They may also look\nto grow the business through acquisitions and insurance-linked\nfinancing such as securitizations, the people said.  The private equity firm is seeking to expand in European\nlife insurance operations as it has done in the U.S., where it\nowns reinsurer Athene Holding Ltd. Apollo also teamed up with\nCVC  Capital Partners  Ltd. last year to buy non-life insurer Brit\nInsurance Holdings BV.  Apollo and other asset managers including Harbinger Capital\nPartners and Guggenheim Partners LLC have targeted life\ninsurers\u2019 unwanted operations in the U.S. to get access to a\nstable pool of funds for their investment-management operations.\nAt the same time, some of the biggest life insurers, such as\nHartford Financial Services Group Inc. and Sun Life Financial\nInc., have stopped selling some U.S. life and annuity products.
