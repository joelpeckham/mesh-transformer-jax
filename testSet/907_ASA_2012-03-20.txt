 "context": "The following article called 'Ship Owners Losing After $11.4 Billion Battle for Boxes: Freight' was published on 2012-03-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAfter a quarter in which companies\nselling space on container lines doubled rates, the amount the\nowners of the ships are being paid is the least in two years.  Operators, who charter vessels and then charge shippers per\ncontainer, are demanding $1,379 for a 20-foot box on the China-\nto- Europe  trade route, up 97 percent this year, according to\n Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the largest shipbroker. A measure of how much\nthey\u2019re paying ship owners fell 4.2 percent since the start of\nJanuary, data from the Hamburg Shipbrokers\u2019 Association show.  The gap is growing because operators are leaving vessels\nidle or hiring fewer ships, driving down how much they pay\nowners, while restricting supply and boosting box rates. RS\nPlatou Markets AS and Fearnley Fonds ASA, units of  Norway \u2019s\nbiggest shipbrokers, recommend selling shares of  Seaspan Corp. (SSW) ,\na Hong Kong-based owner, and buying those of  Orient Overseas\n(International) Ltd. (316) , which manages vessels from the city.  \u201cWhatever increase operators are getting is driving them\nto profitability,\u201d said Rahul Kapoor, a Singapore-based analyst\nfor Platou whose recommendations returned 17 percent in the past\nsix months. \u201cOwners are in no way benefiting and are unlikely\nto benefit.\u201d  The operators had previously spent 14 months in a price war\non the biggest trade routes, losing about $11.4 billion of\nrevenue, according to SeaIntel Maritime Analysis, a research\ncompany in Copenhagen. Orient Overseas will report this year its\nfirst gain in annual  profit  since 2010, analyst estimates\ncompiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. West Coast  Box rates fell 50 percent last year from  China  to Europe,\nthe second-biggest international route, reflecting a glut of\nships rather than contracting demand. The capacity of the global\nfleet rose 77 percent to a record since the end of 2005, data\nfrom Redhill, England-based IHS Fairplay show. Trade gained 44\npercent to an all-time high, London-based Clarkson estimates.  Operators\u2019 earnings are also improving from China to the\nU.S. West Coast, the world\u2019s biggest trade route, with a 40\npercent gain to $1,992 since mid-December, Clarkson data show.  The amount of idled capacity will probably expand to the\nequivalent of 1.1 million boxes by the end of 2012 from 595,000\nat the start of the year, according to Alphaliner, a Paris-based\nindustry consultant. Operators won\u2019t renew leases for some ships\nwhen they expire, said Fotis Giannakoulis, an analyst at Morgan\nStanley in  New York . The Hamburg association\u2019s index, a gauge of\ncosts across six types of container ship, fell to a 21-month low\non Feb. 28.  Slowing Growth  Operators may have to idle even more capacity to sustain\nthe gains because global trade in goods and services will\nadvance 3.8 percent this year, down from 6.9 percent in 2011 and\nalmost 13 percent in 2010, the  International Monetary Fund \npredicted in January.  Efforts by operators to raise rates on the Asia-to-Europe\nroute failed in eight of the past nine attempts, according to\ndata from Alphaliner. Orient Overseas is confident the latest\nincrease will be successful, Stanley Shen, a spokesman for the\ncompany in Hong Kong, wrote in an e-mail.  China will target annual expansion of 7.5 percent, the\nlowest rate since 2004, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in a state-of-\nthe-nation speech March 5. The economy gained 8.9 percent in the\nfourth quarter, the slowest pace in 10 quarters, and exports\nfell 0.5 percent in January, the first drop in more than two\nyears, government data show.  The nation\u2019s trading partners are also weakening, with the\n17-member euro region expected to contract 0.4 percent this\nyear, according to the median of 18 economist estimates compiled\nby Bloomberg.  Fuel Costs  Rising fuel costs may erode earnings even if higher rates\nstick this time. Prices in  Singapore , the largest refueling\nport, averaged $734.21 a metric ton last month, the most in at\nleast nine years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A 10-\nyear-old, 5,000-unit container ship sailing at 22 knots consumes\n124 tons of fuel a day, according to Morgan Stanley.  Analysts anticipate a jump in earnings for operators.\nOrient Overseas, which manages  Hong Kong \u2019s largest container\nline, will report net income of $201.7 million for this year,\ncompared with $181.6 million in 2011, the mean of 22 analyst\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The shares rose 16 percent\nto HK$52.60 this year, and 20 of 26  analysts  covering the\ncompany recommend buying or holding the stock.  Seaspan will report  earnings  of $113 million for this year,\ncompared with $123.4 million in 2011, the mean of eight\nestimates shows. Its shares rose 37 percent this year, and seven\nout of 10 analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying or\nholding the stock. The charters on four of its 72 ships end this\nyear and should have no effect on profit, Chief Executive\nOfficer Gerry Wang said in an interview.  Round Table  \u201cFreight rates are increasing like crazy right now, and\nthere\u2019s tremendous positive sentiment,\u201d Wang said by phone from\n Vancouver  on March 16. \u201cWhen freight rates are good, charter\nrates always come up.\u201d  Owners of other types of vessels are also suffering from\nsupply gluts. About 90 percent of world trade moves by sea,\naccording to the Round Table of International Shipping\nAssociations.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of rates for hauling coal\nand iron ore, dropped 43 percent in the past year, according to\nthe London-based Baltic Exchange, which publishes costs along\nmore than 50 maritime routes. Earnings for very large crude\ncarriers, each carrying about 2 million barrels of oil, averaged\n$47,068 last week, down 79 percent from the all-time high\nreached December 2007 even after rallying 50 percent this year,\nClarkson data show.  Container Index  A measure of the combined earnings of the 14-member\nBloomberg Pure Play Dry Bulk  Shipping Index (BPG4DBS)  will drop 91 percent\nthis year, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe same gauge for the Bloomberg Tanker Index of the six largest\nU.S.-listed owners anticipates they will lose money for a third\nconsecutive year, the predictions show.  The Lloyd\u2019s List Bloomberg Container Index of the 50\nbiggest container-shipping companies rose 22 percent this year,\ncompared with a 13 percent advance in the MSCI All-Country World\nIndex of equities. Treasuries lost 1.8 percent, a Bank of\nAmerica Corp. index shows.  The gap between demand and the capacity of the active\ncontainer fleet will narrow to 2.2 million 20-foot-equivalent\nunits by the fourth quarter, from 3 million units in the last\nquarter of 2011, as trade expands and operators idle vessels or\nreturn them to owners, Platou estimates.  \u201cOperators are now in a mode where ships whose leases\nexpire will not be renewed,\u201d said Giannakoulis of Morgan\nStanley. \u201cTheir strategy of fighting during 2010 and 2011 led\nto huge losses. All the liner companies realize a price war is\nnot to the benefit of the industry.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nIsaac Arnsdorf in London at \n iarnsdorf@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAlaric Nightingale at \n anightingal1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was 24.62859535217285 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was ",
