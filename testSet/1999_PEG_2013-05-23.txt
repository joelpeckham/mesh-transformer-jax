The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S.  nuclear-power generation  rose to\nan 11-week high after reactors in  Massachusetts ,  New Jersey  and\n Maryland  returned to service.  Nationwide production rose  0.9 percent  to 84,982 megawatts,\nor 83 percent of capacity, the most since March 9, according to\nNuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by Bloomberg. Output\nwas  3.4 percent higher  than a year ago with 14 of 104 plants\noffline.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  started the 1,174-megawatt Salem 1 reactor in New Jersey after shutting it for\nmore than five weeks for refueling and planned maintenance. The\nunit, about 18 miles south of Wilmington,  Delaware , was\noperating at 2 percent of capacity today.  Constellation Energy Group Inc. began generation at the\n862-megawatt Calvert Cliffs 2 reactor, about 38 miles south of\nAnnapolis. The reactor, which today operated at 3 percent of\ncapacity, tripped offline on May 21 because of equipment failure\nassociated with the steam generator feed pump, according to the\nNRC.  The 685-megawatt Pilgrim 1 reactor owned by  Entergy Corp. (ETR) \nrestarted and was operating at 1 percent of capacity. The unit,\nabout 4 miles east of Plymouth, Massachusetts, had been shut\nsince mid-April.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the\nU.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase\nconsumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The\naverage refueling down time was 46 days in 2012, according to\nthe  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:\nNaureen S.
