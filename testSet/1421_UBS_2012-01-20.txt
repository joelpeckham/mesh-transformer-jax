The dollar reached a two-week low versus the euro before a\nreport forecast to show sales of existing U.S. homes rose to the\nhighest since May 2010. The 17-nation euro headed for its\nbiggest weekly gain versus dollar in three months after Spanish\nand French borrowing costs fell yesterday at their first\nauctions of medium and long-term debt since being downgraded by\n Standard & Poor\u2019s .  Greece  today starts a third day of talks with\nprivate creditors on a debt-swap plan.  \u201cThe U.S. data is better and that is a huge relief for\neverybody at the moment,\u201d said Jane Foley, a senior currency\nstrategist at Rabobank International in London. \u201cThe yen and\nthe dollar are coming under some pressure.\u201d  The yen was little changed at 99.96 per euro at 8:31 a.m.\nLondon time, having dropped 2.4 percent this week.

Data yesterday showed U.S.\ninitial jobless claims slid to the lowest since April 2008.  U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 3 percent annual rate\nin the final quarter of 2011, up from a 1.8 percent gain in the\nprevious three-month period, a separate survey showed before a\nJan. 27 report from the Commerce Department. That would be the\nmost since the second quarter in 2010.  \u201cThe good U.S. economic figures are positive for risk\nsentiment, resulting in the selling of the dollar and yen,\u201d\nsaid Kengo Suzuki, a foreign-exchange strategist in Tokyo at\nMizuho Securities Co., a unit of  Japan \u2019s third-biggest listed\nbank by market value. \u201cPeople are adjusting their positions\nwhile saying it\u2019s \u2018risk on.\u2019\u201d  The euro has strengthened 0.7 percent over the past week,\naccording to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen\nweakened 1.9 percent, the worst performance among the 10\ndeveloped-nation currencies tracked by the gauges. The dollar\nlost 1.6 percent.  Debt Sales  France and  Spain  sold 14.6 billion euros of bonds yesterday\nwith lower funding costs.

Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said yesterday\nprogress was made in debt-swap talks with officials from the\n Institute of International Finance  in  Athens  and discussions\nwill continue today.  Demand for the euro was tempered after S&P said yesterday\nthat European companies\u2019 debt-default rates will probably rise\nin 2012 as economies shrink and tighter bank lending curbs\nfinancing.  About 6.1 percent of companies in  Europe  whose credit\nratings are lower than investment grade may default this year,\nS&P said. That compares with a default rate of 3.1 percent in\nthe fourth quarter of 2011.  The economy of the euro area may contract 0.3 percent this\nyear, the  World Bank  said on Jan. 17.  \u2018Downward Pressure\u2019  \u201cConsidering the economic situation and monetary policy,\nthere will be downward pressure on the euro,\u201d said  Daisaku Ueno , a foreign-currency strategist at UBS AG in  Tokyo .  The Australian and  New Zealand  dollars headed for a fifth\nweek of gains as a purchasing managers\u2019 index indicated a third\nmonth of manufacturing contraction in  China , boosting the case\nfor policy makers in the world\u2019s second-largest economy to\nloosen credit controls.  The preliminary January reading of 48.8 for a PMI released\ntoday by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compares with a\nfinal 48.7 number for December.
