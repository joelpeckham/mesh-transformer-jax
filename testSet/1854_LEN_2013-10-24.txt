(PHM) , the second-largest\nU.S. homebuilder by market value, reported a third-quarter\nprofit that beat analysts\u2019 estimates as  house prices  climbed.

That topped the 36-cent average of 18 analyst\nestimates, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Homebuilders are benefiting from a tight  supply  of existing\nhomes on the market, which is boosting real estate values even\nas rising mortgage rates slow demand. PulteGroup has focused on\nincreasing its profit margins rather than the pace of sales, by\ncutting costs and raising prices. While its orders fell, the\ncompany\u2019s average selling price in the third quarter climbed 11\npercent from a year earlier to $310,000.  \u201cThe company delivered what is arguably the most\ninteresting performance of the quarter,\u201d Stephen East, an\nanalyst at International Strategy & Investment Group LLC in St.\nCharles, Missouri, said in a note today.

PulteGroup\u2019s orders dropped 17 percent from a year earlier\nto 3,781 homes, a sign rising borrowing costs are holding back\nhomebuyers. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was\n4.32 percent at the end of the third quarter, up from 3.35\npercent in early May, according to  Freddie Mac .  Net income was $2.28 billion, or $5.87 a share, compared\nwith $116.6 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier.
