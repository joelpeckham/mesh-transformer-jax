The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHungary\u2019s three-year bond yields\nfell to a record low on speculation below-target  inflation  will\nallow the central bank to cut its benchmark rate further before\nborrowing costs rebound next year.  The yields dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage\npoint to 4.46 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began\ncompiling the data, by 1:29 p.m. in Budapest. The forint was\nlittle changed at 294.5 per euro.  Consumer prices  increased 1.4\npercent in September from a year earlier after a 1.3 percent\ngain in August, the statistics office in Budapest said today.\nThe Magyar Nemzeti Bank targets inflation at 3 percent.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  is planning further cuts in\nutility tariffs in November after a 10 percent reduction in\nJanuary. That and lower fuel prices may push inflation below 1\npercent, allowing the central bank to extend the 14 months of\ncuts that took the benchmark rate to a record-low 3.6 percent,\naccording to Istvan Horvath, a director at K&H Alapkezelo, the\nBudapest-based fund management unit of  KBC Groep NV. (KBC)   \u201cThere is still room for one or two rate cuts, though\nwe\u2019re undoubtedly getting closer to the end of the easing\ncycle,\u201d Horvath, who helps oversee $3.8 billion at K&H, said in\ne-mailed comments. \u201cIt\u2019s worth taking profit on short-term\nbonds now.\u201d  Inflation trends warrant a \u201cloose\u201d policy, Csaba\nKandracs, who was appointed to the Monetary Council last month,\nsaid, according to an interview in newspaper Magyar Nemzet\nyesterday. Central bank President Gyorgy Matolcsy\u2019s forecast\nthat the  base rate  will fall to between 3 and 3.5 percent should\nbe regarded as \u201cforward guidance\u201d and \u201cnot set in stone,\u201d\nKandracs said.  Policy makers may cut the main rate by 60 basis points this\nyear and start tightening policy in the second half of 2014,\nAbbas Ameli-Renani, a London-based analyst at Royal Bank of\nScotland Group Plc, wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. ING\nGroep NV also expects rate increases to start in the second half\nof 2014, Budapest-based analyst Andras Balatoni told reporters\non Oct. 9.
