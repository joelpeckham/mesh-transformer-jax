The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe euro strengthened against the\ndollar for a second week as investors reduced record bets\nagainst the currency before  Greece \u2019s June 17 election, and amid\nspeculation central banks may provide aid to financial markets.  The 17-nation currency erased earlier losses against the\ndollar on concern its decline since April has been overdone.\nCentral banks are preparing for coordinated action to provide\nliquidity, if needed, after a general election in Greece in two\ndays, Reuters reported. The dollar headed for weekly declines\nversus major peers as weaker U.S. growth added to the case for\nfurther monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve.  \u201cThe market has been paring back on their short euro\npositions,\u201d said  Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist\nin New York at Bank of New York Mellon Corp. \u201cThe market is\nseverely short euros still. Because the uncertainty surrounding\nthe elections, market players wish, going into the weekend, to\nbe more neutral in their positioning.\u201d A short is a bet the\nprice of an asset will fall.  The euro was little changed at $1.2638 at 5 p.m. in  New\nYork , pushing its weekly gain to 1 percent. The currency fell\n0.8 percent to 99.49 yen. The dollar lost 0.8 percent to 78.73\nyen, reaching the biggest drop since May 31.

The real rose 0.2 percent to 2.0509 per dollar.  \u201cIt is the ultimate risk-aversion trade to take long\ndollar positions in the face of global adversity, so anything\nthat suggests otherwise would see liquidation of long dollar\npositions,\u201d said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales\nat Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . \u201cThe global response\nin the form of coordinated action is beginning to kick in.\u201d  Hedge funds  and other  large speculators  pared their bets on\na drop in the euro against the dollar last week from a record\nhigh, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed.  Futures traders decreased net euro short contracts to\n195,187 in the week ended June 12, the figures showed. They\nreached a high of 214,418 the week ended June 5.

Greece Votes  Greeks will vote for the second time in six weeks after a\nMay 6 ballot failed to yield a government. The final opinion\npolls showed no party set to win a majority. Exit polls will be\nreleased when voting ends at 7 p.m. in  Athens , with a first\nofficial result estimate due around 9:30 p.m. The elections will\nbe followed by meetings by Group of 20 policy makers on June 18-\n19.

Spain  on June 9\nbecame the fourth of 17 members to request a bailout.  \u201cIf you have negative news from Greece, it\u2019s negative for\nSpain, but if you have positive news from Greece, Spain still\nhas issues,\u201d said Jose Wynne, head of North America foreign-\nexchange research at Barclays Plc in New York. \u201cA weaker euro\nwill be part of any solution for  Europe . We would only be\nswitching gears if we saw a lot of central bank intervention.\u201d  Spain\u2019s Debt  Spain experienced a backlash following last week\u2019s 100\nbillion euro ($126 billion) bailout. The country\u2019s bonds\nslumped, with 10-year yields rising to a euro-era record, after\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service cut the nation\u2019s credit rating to one\nstep above junk, citing its rising debt burden and weakening\neconomy.  Wynne said the euro may appreciate to $1.27 or $1.2750\nshould the pro-bailout New Democracy party garner a majority of\nvotes in the Greek election. He recommended then selling the\ncurrency, as it won\u2019t gain beyond that level.  The yen strengthened the most in two weeks against the\ndollar after the  Bank of Japan  refrained from expanding monetary\nstimulus that debases the currency.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary\nindex of consumer sentiment for June fell to 74.1 from 79.3 at\nthe end of last month.  \u201cWeak data does encourage expectations of some easing from\nthe  Federal Reserve  next week,\u201d said  Vassili Serebriakov , a\ncurrency strategist at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York. \u201cWe\u2019ve\ncertainly seen a string of softer data in the U.S. If I were to\npick a currency that would benefit from softer U.S. numbers at\nthis point it would probably be the yen.\u201d  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of bonds in two rounds of so-\ncalled quantitative easing from 2008 through 2011 to stimulate\nthe economy through lower borrowing costs. Central bank policy\nmakers meet on June 19 and 20.
