Equities rose in the week\u2019s final session as  JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. (JPM)  paced a rally in banks following a downgrade by Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service that was no worse than the credit-rating firm\nhad warned.

Operation Twist  U.S. stocks retreated even as the Fed said it will extend\nits stimulus program known as Operation Twist, disappointing\ninvestors anticipating a more aggressive approach.  \u201cThe Fed is doing whatever it can and be extraordinarily\naccommodative,\u201d Dean Junkans, chief investment officer for the\nwealth management, brokerage and retirement units of San\nFrancisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co ., which oversees $1.3 trillion\nin client assets, said in a June 20 phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s\nimportant for them to do something to show support for the\nmarket, but I don\u2019t think it will have a material impact on the\neconomy.\u201d  Expectations for further policy action gave stocks their\nfirst back-to-back weekly gain since April on June 15.

Financial shares rallied on the last day to pare their\nweekly loss to 0.1 percent as group.
