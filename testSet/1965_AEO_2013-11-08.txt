 "context": "The following article called 'Gap Climbs After Expected Quarterly Profit Exceeds Estimates' was published on 2013-11-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGap Inc. (GPS) , the biggest U.S. specialty-apparel retailer, climbed the most in 15 months after saying it\nanticipates quarterly profit that surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates,\nhelped by gains in sales.  The San Francisco-based retailer rose 7.2 percent to $40.47\nat 9:45 a.m. in New York after rising as much as 8 percent for\nthe biggest intraday gain since August 2012.  Gap said profit in the third quarter ended Nov. 2 was as\nmuch as 71 cents a share, compared with 63 cents a year earlier.\nThat exceeds the 66-cent average of analysts\u2019 estimates. Net\nsales in the quarter rose 3.1 percent to $3.98 billion, Gap also\nsaid in a statement yesterday, beating the average estimate of\n$3.96 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Glenn Murphy  is seeing success in\nturning around sales at the company, drawing customers to the\nGap brand with new denim and fitness apparel and to Old Navy\nwith its value-focused pricing.  \u201cOf all the apparel retailers, Gap is still better\npositioned to gain share,\u201d Poonam Goyal, a retail analyst for\nBloomberg Industries, said in an interview. \u201cOctober sales were\ngood and the guidance was good, and hence the stock is up.\u201d  Gap said comparable sales rose 4 percent in October,\nexceeding analysts\u2019 average estimate for a 0.6 percent increase,\naccording to Retail Metrics Inc. Same-store sales rose 1 percent\nin the third quarter, compared to a 6 percent gain a year\nearlier.  Sales Discounts  Same-store sales for the more than 10 retailers tracked by\nRetail Metrics rose 3.4 percent last month, excluding results\nfrom drugstores, the Swampscott, Massachusetts-based researcher\nsaid in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Analysts had estimated\na 2.3 percent gain, the researcher said.  Gap may have boosted its sales through discounts, which\nwere deeper across all brands in October than last year,\naccording to research by Janney Capital Markets. The retailer\nyesterday said it expects to report profit margins on\nmerchandise sold in the third quarter that were lower than the\nsame time last year.  In the absence of a strong fashion trend like last year\u2019s\ncolored denim, apparel retailers are turning to discounts to woo\nshoppers, which may hurt margins in the fourth quarter as well.\nGap announced Nov. 6 that its  Old Navy  brand will award $1\nmillion to one shopper on Black Friday.  \u2018Tough Spot\u2019  \u201cCompetitively they\u2019re in a tough spot because teen and\nyoung-adult apparel is the most competitive category to be in\nright now,\u201d Ike Boruchow, a New York-based analyst at Sterne,\nAgee & Leach Inc. said in a phone interview before the results\nwere released. He has the equivalent of a sell rating on the\nshares.  Retailers from  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  to L Brands Inc. reported a\ngain in monthly sales in October as cooler temperatures helped\ndrive demand for sweaters and jeans. J.C. Penney posted its\nfirst monthly gain in almost two years as sales at stores open\nat least 12 months rose 0.9 percent in October, the company said\nyesterday.  L Brands Inc. (LTD) , which owns the Victoria\u2019s Secret and\nBath & Body Works brands, said in a statement yesterday that\ncomparable-store sales rose 8 percent, exceeding the estimate\nfor a 2.5 percent increase.  Meanwhile, teen retailers saw sales decline in the third\nquarter as companies discounted merchandise to lure customers\nwith no major fashion trend to drive sales.  Abercrombie & Fitch\nCo. (ANF)  said this week that comparable-store sales fell 14 percent\nin the quarter ended Nov. 2. Third quarter same-store sales at\n American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO)  fell 5 percent including online\nsales, the company said in a Nov. 6 statement.  Gap\u2019s shares had gained 22 percent this year through the\nclose yesterday, compared to a 23 percent rise in the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index.  The company will release its full third-quarter earnings\nresults on Nov. 21.
