The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n* Two cargoes have yet to arrive in Egypt - minister\n* Trader AOS declines to comment\n* AOS is a leading supplier of wheat to Egypt\nBy Maha El Dahan and Eric Knecht\nDUBAI/CAIRO, May 23 (Reuters) - Dubai-based trader AOS, a leading supplier of wheat to Egypt, has failed to deliver two of its cargoes, Supply Minister Ali Moselhy told Reuters.\nMoselhy, who is also chairman of Egypt\u2019s state grain buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), said AOS had been offered two extensions for the delayed cargoes of about 120,000 tonnes of wheat but still failed to supply them.\nAOS declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n\u201cThey (AOS) have failed to deliver two cargoes, there were delays and we arranged new timings for them ... but they did not execute,\u201d Moselhy said. \u201cThey are now outside of their contractual terms (with GASC).\u201d\nHe declined to provide details of the cargoes, including country of origin, and did not specify their value.\nEgypt baffled grain traders last week by holding an international purchase tender for wheat, in which GASC bought 60,000 tonnes despite a plentiful local harvest that would normally mark a pause in imports until around July.\nThe tender raised questions over why Egypt, the world\u2019s largest wheat buyer, needed to buy cargoes at a time of high prices as the season for Black Sea wheat neared its close.\nThe missing AOS cargoes could force Egypt to tap global markets sooner than expected to maintain reserves of the grain, which the government considers politically sensitive for its role in supplying the country\u2019s bread subsidy programme.\nEgypt has operated a massive bread subsidy system since the 1960s, which no Egyptian leader has been able to modify due to fears of unrest like the 1977 bread riots.\nAOS Chairman Mohamed al-Naqbi said last November that the trader supplies Egypt with about 20 percent of the country\u2019s annual grain needs, including 700,000 tonnes of wheat to GASC and 1.7 million tonnes to the private market.\nThe Egyptian government spends about $1.5 billion annually on state wheat imports.
