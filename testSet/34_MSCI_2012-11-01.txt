 "context": "The following article called 'Bill Gross Says Quantitative Easing Not Spurring Investments' was published on 2012-11-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBill Gross , who runs the world\u2019s\nbiggest mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said\nthere is no evidence that investment is being spurred by the\n Federal Reserve \u2019s quantitative easing program.  \u201cAll of the money being created and freed up is elevating\nasset prices, but those prices are not causing corporations to\ninvest in future production,\u201d Gross wrote in a monthly\ninvestment outlook posted on the  Newport Beach , California-based\ncompany\u2019s  website  today. Lower  interest rates  are being used\n\u201cto consume as opposed to invest,\u201d he said.  Investors should recognize that asset and currency prices\nultimately rest on the ability of the economy to grow, Gross\nwrote. If real growth is stunted in the U.S. and globally, then\ninvestors should also acknowledge \u201cbite-sized\u201d future returns\nand the growing risks of \u201cmisguided\u201d monetary and fiscal\npolicy that may disrupt financial markets at some point. The so-\ncalled fiscal cliff may be the first of a series of disruptions,\nthough Gross expects some type of compromise on the possible tax\nincreases and budget cuts.  The fiscal cliff refers to the more than $600 billion of\nfederal spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect at\nthe start of next year unless Congress acts. JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., the largest U.S. bank by assets, said last month that the\ncombination will subtract 1 percentage point from U.S. growth.  Treasury Purchases  \u201cTo be fair,  Ben Bernanke  has been operating with one arm\nbehind his back and has been calling for cooperative stimulation\nfrom the fiscal side of this government,\u201d Gross wrote. \u201cHe has\nreceived little response - not from Democrats, not from\nRepublicans.\u201d  Fed officials led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  implemented\n$2.3 trillion in two rounds of bond purchases, known as\nquantitative easing, since 2008 to boost economic growth. In\nJune, the central bank expanded what\u2019s become known as its\nOperation Twist program to replace $400 billion of short-term\nbonds with longer-term debt, by $267 billion.  The Fed announced Sept. 13 a third round of QE in which\nit\u2019s making open-ended purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt\na month as it seeks to boost economic growth and reduce\nunemployment. Policy makers said they will keep pumping money\ninto the economy until there was \u201congoing, sustained\nimprovement\u201d in the labor market.  All 21 primary dealers that trade the securities with the\ncentral bank expect latest QE measures to be expanded to include\nTreasuries, according to a Bloomberg News survey in the week\nended Oct. 19.  Election Pessimism  Gross domestic product was forecast to rise 2 percent in\n2013 before the Atlantic storm Sandy devastated the northeastern\nU.S. this week, according to the median forecast of economists\nin a Bloomberg News survey as of Oct. 29. With damage still\nbeing assessed, predictions pegged the economic loss from the\nTexas-sized storm to be as much as $50 billion.  This year\u2019s race for the White House between President\n Barack Obama  and Republican challenger  Mitt Romney  doesn\u2019t make\nGross optimistic about the prospects for change.  \u201cFact is they\u2019re all the same -- bought and paid for with\nthe same money,\u201d Gross wrote. \u201cPulling a Democratic or\nRepublican lever will deliver the same results every four\nyears.\u201d  Market Returns  A report tomorrow from the Labor Department is forecast to\nshow the U.S. added 125,000 jobs in October, compared with\n114,000 in the previous month, according to the median forecast\nof economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate is\nexpected to rise to 7.9 percent, from 7.8 percent.  Treasury yields should stay low in this type of environment,\nwhile what Gross has called the \u201ccult of equity\u201d or even total\nreturn, is over, he reiterated, if that presumes a resumption of\nhistorical patterns anywhere close to \u201cdouble digits.\u201d  U.S. government bonds have returned 2.1 percent this year,\nwhile bonds in an index of U.S. investment-grade and high-yield\ncompany debt gained 10.95 percent, according to Bank of America\nMerrill indexes. The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of shares\ngained 13.2 percent this year, including reinvested dividends.  The $281 billion Total Return Fund managed by Gross has\nreturned 10 percent in the past year, beating 94 percent of its\npeers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It gained 0.37\npercent over the past month, beating 56 percent of its peers.\nThe firm manages $1.92 trillion in assets as of Sept. 30.
