The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina \u2019s new home prices jumped in\nJune by the most since they reversed declines in December,\ndefying the government\u2019s tightened property curbs as increased\nsales supported developers\u2019 efforts to avoid price cuts.  Prices surged 7.4 percent last month from a year earlier to\n10,258 yuan ($1,671) per square meter (10.76 square feet),\n SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the nation\u2019s biggest real estate website\nowner, said in a statement after a survey of 100 cities. Last\nmonth\u2019s increase was the biggest since December, when prices\nclimbed 0.03 percent, reversing a 0.46 percent fall in November.  The Chinese government is facing a dilemma to cool the\nproperty market while sustaining  growth  in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. The country\nstepped up a three-year campaign to cool home prices in March,\nwhile only the capital city of Beijing among 35 provincial-level\ncities issued the toughest measures, according to Centaline\nProperty Agency Ltd., China\u2019s biggest real estate agency.  \u201cSales have been stable, but supplies didn\u2019t increase;\nprices naturally will trend upwards,\u201d said Dai Fang, a\nShanghai-based analyst at Zheshang Securities Co., citing the\ncurrent demand to own or upgrade first homes after speculators\nwere driven out by government curbs. \u201cThe central government\nwill probably still wait and see, as the current price increases\nare a result of market mechanisms.\u201d  \u2018Remains Strong\u2019  A  gauge  tracking property shares rose 1.1 percent at the\nclose of trading in Shanghai, while the benchmark Shanghai\nComposite Index added 0.8 percent.  The value of home sales rose 1.7 percent in May from the\nprevious month to 503 billion  yuan , the National Bureau of\nStatistics reported June 9.  \u201cBoth new and existing-home transactions gradually\nstabilized recently in many cities, indicating that home buying\ndemand remains strong,\u201d SouFun said in the statement today.\n\u201cDriven by the multiple factors including demand and a heated\nland market, the pressure for home-price increases is still\nrelatively large\u201d for the second-half of this year.  China\u2019s economy grew 7.7 percent in the first quarter, less\nthan the 8 percent median forecast in a survey of 41 economists.  Home prices rose 0.77 percent last month from May,\nnarrowing by 4 basis points from the previous month on a month-on-month basis as some banks tightened mortgage policy amid a\ncash crunch, according to the SouFun statement.  Changshu, Beijing  The city of Changshu in eastern Jiangsu province had the\nbiggest gain last month from May, with prices increasing 3.6\npercent, SouFun said. Home values in the capital Beijing jumped\n1.6 percent from the previous month, while those in  Shanghai ,\nthe country\u2019s financial center, added 0.6 percent.  China\u2019s property industry was raised to outperform to\nmarket perform by Toni Ho, Hong Kong-based analyst at BOCOM\nInternational Securities Ltd. last week, because the\ngovernment\u2019s property policies are \u201cstabilizing measures\u201d\nrather than radical ones to create a turning point.  Sentiment also improved in the land market. Land sales in\nBeijing as of June 27 hit 66 billion yuan, exceeding the total\nvalue of the city last year, China Securities Journal reported\non June 28, without citing anyone.
