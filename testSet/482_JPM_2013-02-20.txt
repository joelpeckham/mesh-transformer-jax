 "context": "The following article called 'Why Should Taxpayers Give Big Banks $83 Billion a Year?' was published on 2013-02-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOn television, in interviews and in\nmeetings with investors, executives of the biggest U.S. banks --\nnotably JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive  Jamie Dimon  -- make\nthe case that size is a competitive advantage. It helps them\nlower costs and vie for customers on an international scale.\nLimiting it, they warn, would impair profitability and weaken\nthe country\u2019s position in global finance.  So what if we told you that, by our calculations, the\nlargest U.S. banks aren\u2019t really profitable at all? What if the\nbillions of dollars they allegedly earn for their shareholders\nwere almost entirely a gift from U.S. taxpayers?  Granted, it\u2019s a hard concept to swallow. It\u2019s also crucial\nto understanding why the big banks present such a threat to the\nglobal economy.  Let\u2019s start with a bit of background. Banks have a powerful\nincentive to get big and unwieldy. The larger they are, the more\ndisastrous their failure would be and the more certain they can\nbe of a government bailout in an emergency. The result is an\nimplicit subsidy: The banks that are potentially the most\ndangerous can borrow at lower rates, because creditors perceive\nthem as too big to fail.  Lately, economists have tried to pin down exactly how much\nthe subsidy lowers big banks\u2019 borrowing costs. In one relatively\nthorough  effort , two researchers -- Kenichi Ueda of the\n International Monetary Fund  and Beatrice Weder di Mauro of the\nUniversity of Mainz -- put the number at about 0.8 percentage\npoint. The discount applies to all their liabilities, including\nbonds and customer deposits.  Big Difference  Small as it might sound, 0.8 percentage point makes a big\ndifference. Multiplied by the total liabilities of the 10\nlargest U.S. banks by assets, it amounts to a taxpayer subsidy\nof $83 billion a year. To put the figure in perspective, it\u2019s\ntantamount to the government giving the banks about 3 cents of\nevery tax dollar collected.  The top five banks -- JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp.,\nCitigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -\n- account for $64 billion of the total subsidy, an amount\nroughly equal to their typical annual profits (see tables for\ndata on individual banks). In other words, the banks occupying\nthe commanding heights of the U.S. financial industry -- with\nalmost $9 trillion in assets, more than half the size of the\n U.S. economy  -- would just about break even in the absence of\ncorporate welfare. In large part, the profits they report are\nessentially transfers from taxpayers to their shareholders.  Neither bank executives nor shareholders have much\nincentive to change the situation. On the contrary, the\nfinancial industry spends  hundreds of millions  of dollars every\nelection cycle on campaign donations and lobbying, much of which\nis aimed at maintaining the subsidy. The result is a bloated\nfinancial sector and recurring credit gluts. Left unchecked, the\nsuperbanks could ultimately require bailouts that exceed the\ngovernment\u2019s resources. Picture a meltdown in which the Treasury\nis helpless to step in as it did in 2008 and 2009.  Regulators can change the game by paring down the subsidy.\nOne option is to make banks fund their activities with more\nequity from shareholders, a measure that would make them less\nlikely to need bailouts (we recommend $1 of equity for each $5\nof assets, far more than the 1-to-33 ratio that new global rules\nrequire). Another idea is to shock creditors out of complacency\nby making some of them take losses when banks run into trouble.\nA third is to prevent banks from using the subsidy to finance\nspeculative trading, the aim of the Volcker rule in the U.S. and\nfinancial ring-fencing in the U.K.  Once shareholders fully recognized how poorly the biggest\nbanks perform without government support, they would be\nmotivated to demand better. This could entail anything from\ncutting pay packages to breaking down financial juggernauts into\nmore manageable units. The market discipline might not please\nexecutives, but it would certainly be an improvement over paying\nbanks to put us in danger.
