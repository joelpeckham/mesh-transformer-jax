Profit from continuing operations rose to $476 million, or\n30 cents a share, from $411 million, or 26 cents, a year\nearlier, the Abbott Park, Illinois-based company said in a\nstatement today. Earnings, excluding one-time items, of 46 cents\na share beat by 2 cents the average of 21 analysts\u2019 estimates\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Sales in emerging markets rose 13 percent, helping revenue\nincrease 2.5 percent to $5.45 billion from a year earlier. Sales\nin China and Russia grew more than 30 percent each, Chief\nFinancial Officer Thomas Freyman said on a conference call\ntoday. New products are bolstering Abbott\u2019s performance, said\n Joanne Wuensch , an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York,\nin a July 15 note. The company has won approval for 45 medicines\nin 14 emerging markets, she said.  \u201cEverything appears to be in line, the story appears to be\non track, and EPS was better than expected,\u201d Wuensch said today\nin a telephone call. Emerging markets were about 40 percent of\nAbbott\u2019s sales, \u201cconsiderably driving revenue,\u201d she said in a\nlater e-mail.  Forecast Reiterated  Abbott reiterated its 2013  forecast  excluding one-time\nitems of $1.98 to $2.04 a share. Net income dropped 72 percent\nto $476 million, or 30 cents, from $1.73 billion, or $1.08, a\nyear earlier, when the company\u2019s drug unit was still included in\nresults. The drug business was split off into a new company,\n AbbVie Inc.

Abbott gained less than 1 percent to $35.82 at the close in\nNew York. The shares have increased 14 percent this year.  \u201cWe still expect Abbott\u2019s sales and earnings per share\ngrowth to outpace its MedTech and diversified peers,\u201d said\n Glenn Novarro , an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in New York, in\na July 15 note to clients. \u201cAbbott is the fastest-growing large\ncap company in our universe. As such, a premium valuation is\njustified.\u201d  Abbott retained the original company\u2019s medical devices,\nnutritional products, diagnostic tests and generic drugs.\nAbbVie, which will report earnings on July 26, kept the brand\nname drugs, including the best-selling Humira for rheumatoid\narthritis.
