 "context": "The following article called 'Australia's Economy Likely Entered `Soft Patch' on Higher Rates, Currency' was published on 2010-11-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia\u2019s  economic growth  slowed\nlast quarter as higher borrowing costs and less government\nstimulus weakened the housing market, while a stronger currency\nhurt exports, economists predicted a government report will show.  Gross domestic product advanced 0.4 percent from the\nprevious three months, when it grew 1.2 percent, according to\nthe median of 21  estimates  in a Bloomberg News survey. The\nBureau of Statistics releases the report tomorrow at 11:30 a.m.\nin Sydney, six days before the central bank holds its final\npolicy meeting of the year.  The report may show effects from Reserve Bank of Australia\nrate increases aimed at cooling inflation sparked by a mining-\nindustry expansion that Governor  Glenn Stevens  yesterday said\nwill extend \u201cover a longish horizon.\u201d Tighter monetary policy,\nless housing aid and a 7.2 percent gain in the local dollar this\nyear have weakened consumer demand and slowed sales abroad.  \u201cAustralia hit a soft patch in the third quarter\u201d as the\n\u201cdrivers of growth transition from the public to the private\nsector against a backdrop of rising interest rates,\u201d said  Katie Dean , head of Australian macroeconomics at Australia & New\nZealand Banking Group in Melbourne.  Compared with a year earlier, Australia\u2019s economy probably\nexpanded 3.4 percent in the third quarter, after gaining 3.3\npercent from a year earlier in the previous period, the  survey \nof economists showed.  Dollar\u2019s Advance  The nation\u2019s employers  added 106,200 jobs  from July through\nSeptember, the biggest increase in four years. That helped\nstrengthen the local currency 15 percent against the U.S. dollar\nin the third quarter, the second-biggest quarterly jump in four\ndecades, according to Bloomberg data.  A stronger currency weighs on export sales, which account\nfor about one-fifth of the country\u2019s GDP.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Australia\u2019s third-biggest\nproducer of iron ore, this month approved an $8.4 billion\nexpansion in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara region to almost triple\noutput as demand from steelmakers gains.  It joins Rio Tinto Group, Vale SA and BHP Billiton Ltd. in\nannouncing expansions as prices increase. Producers are seeking\nto meet demand from steel mills in China, where consumption of\nthe alloy is forecast by Rio Tinto to double by 2020 from 2008\nlevels.  \u2018Wary of Overheating\u2019  \u201cOn all the indications available, we are living through an\nevent that occurs maybe once or twice in a century,\u201d Stevens\nsaid in an address to a Committee for Economic Development of\nAustralia event in Melbourne yesterday. \u201cWe obviously have to\nbe wary of overheating.\u201d  Citing expectations for a \u201clarge expansionary shock\u201d from\ntrade, the RBA on Nov. 2 ended a five-month pause in raising\ninterest rates to contain expected faster inflation in 2011. It\nwas the seventh increase in 14 months and the most aggressive\nround of tightening by a Group of 20 nation.  In a statement after the decision, Stevens said the economy\nhad \u201crelatively modest amounts of spare capacity.\u201d  That outlook is shared by the International Monetary Fund,\nwhich predicts Australia\u2019s economy will accelerate 3.5 percent\nnext year on China\u2019s demand for raw materials and energy.  Home Building  Australian home-building approvals snapped a six-month\ndecline in October, and the nation\u2019s current-account deficit\nwidened in the third quarter, reports released today in Sydney\nshowed.  The number of permits granted to build or renovate houses\nand apartments surged 9.3 percent from September, the Bureau of\nStatistics said in Sydney today. That exceeded the median\nforecast for a 1.4 percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey of 20\neconomists.     The Australian dollar initially rose after the\nbuilding-approvals report, before trading at 96.23 U.S. cents at\n4:30 p.m. in Sydney, down from 96.31 cents late yesterday.  A separate report showed the shortfall on goods, services\nand investment increased to A$7.83 billion ($7.55 billion) from\na revised A$5.41 billion in the second quarter as the\nstrengthening currency lowered exports.  Net exports subtracted 0.4 percentage point from growth in\nthe third quarter, the current-account report showed.  The RBA said in a release today that loans provided by\nAustralian banks and finance companies rose 0.1 percent in\nOctober from the previous month. Lending to companies fell 0.8\npercent from September and 3.2 percent from a year earlier, the\ncentral bank said.  Weaker Profits  A report published yesterday showed business profits fell\n1.5 percent last quarter, as weaker earnings at financial and\nconstruction companies led to the first quarterly decline in\nmore than a year. A Nov. 10 report showed consumer confidence\nfell to a five-month low.  Australian business confidence fell for a second month in\nOctober as conditions deteriorated to the weakest in more than a\nyear on declining profitability for retail and construction\ncompanies, according to a private monthly survey released Nov. 9.  \u201cPublic sector investment also likely fell in the quarter\nas the school building program has peaked out,\u201d said  Paul Brennan , an economist at Citigroup Inc. in Sydney.  Construction companies benefited from more than A$20\nbillion in government spending on roads, railways and schools,\nstarted last year to help buttress the economy against weaker\nglobal growth.  In testimony last week to lawmakers in Canberra, Stevens\nreiterated the central bank\u2019s outlook for growth of about 3.5\npercent in 2011 and 2012. He added that \u201cit would take only\npretty moderate growth in the second half of the year to achieve\nthat forecast for 2010.\u201d  To contact the reporter for this story:\n Michael Heath  in Sydney at \n mheath1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChris Anstey in Tokyo at  canstey@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was 53.63355255126953 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was ",
