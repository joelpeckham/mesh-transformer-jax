The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHolmen AB (HOLMB) , which makes the pink\npaper for the Financial Times, is betting on simpler and cheaper\nproducts that mimic magazine-stock quality to win new business\nas smartphones and tablets cut into newsprint sales.  The Stockholm-based company\u2019s new paper grades such as\n TRND , which has a matte surface and is a bit thicker than\ntraditional magazine quality, are increasingly used by clients\nfor mail advertising campaigns, Chief Executive Officer\nMagnus Hall said in an interview. In the next step, he\u2019ll\ntargeting magazine publishers in need to cut costs.  \u201cOur biggest challenge at the moment is in Holmen Paper,\nto continue the development of new products that can compete\nwith traditional products,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pace is very high\nbecause of the importance to adapt to the changing market.\u201d  Demand for newsprint is falling as traditional newspapers\nand magazines increasingly publish online and computers,\nsmartphones and tablets are becoming the main sources of\ninformation for readers. Holmen, which exports 90 percent of its\noutput to  Europe  and this month reported fourth-quarter profit\nthat missed analysts\u2019 estimates, is also hurt by declining\ndemand amid the continent\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis.  The company\u2019s biggest unit, Holmen Paper, generated about\n45 percent of the company\u2019s 17.9 billion kronor ($2.8 billion)\nin sales last year. Holmen also owns saw mills and forest land,\nmakes paperboard-based packaging for  consumer goods  such as food\nproducts, cosmetics and tobacco and offers hydro- and wind power\nenergy services.  Packaging Lifeline  While Holmen\u2019s 5.2 percent increase in Stockholm trading in\nthe last 12 months was less than the 9.2 percent gain of the OMX\nStockholm 30 Index, the company still fared better than\ncompetitors. Finnish rivals  UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V)  and  Stora Enso Oyj (STERV) \ndropped 14 percent and 10 percent respectively and Norwegian\nrival  Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG)  declined 44 percent.  Holmen, with a market value of 16.9 billion kronor and\npaper production sites at  Hallstavik  and  Norrkoeping , is under\nless pressure than other paper companies as it has a diverse\nportfolio with valuable assets in its forest and energy\nholdings, Handelsbanken analyst Karri Rinta said. The attempt to\nsell new paper grades to magazines makes sense as it represents\na new market for Holmen which traditionally was selling to\nnewspapers, he said.  \u201cThey weren\u2019t in magazine paper to begin with, so they can\nmake the shift without cannibalizing on other businesses,\u201d\nRinta said. \u201cThe improved newsprint paper is cheaper and good\nenough, which makes it a winning concept in the long run.\u201d  Good Enough  The TRND newsprint grade offers quality that is good enough\nfor magazine makers while being cheaper as it isn\u2019t given a\nglossy appearance and uses fewer chemicals, according to\nspokesman  Jonas Lindell . While the paper is a bit thicker, it\nstill weighs less than traditional magazine paper, making it\ncheaper as buyers pay per ton, he said.  As magazines face plunging circulation and advertising\nspending, their owners are seeking ways to cut costs.  Bertelsmann AG\u2019s Gruner + Jahr unit, Europe\u2019s biggest\nmagazine publisher, in November decided to shut down its\nFinancial Times Deutschland newspaper and said it will try to\nsell investment magazine Boerse Online and monthly publication\nImpulse. Washington Post Co. said this month it may sell its\ndowntown headquarters to relocate to a property that will make\nits operations more efficient.  Holmen aims to keep the output at its paper unit, which had\nan operating loss of 99 million kronor last year as sales\ndecreased 5.6 percent, at a stable level, Hall said. At the\nIggesund packaging division, the company targets to increase\noutput at a \u201cmoderate\u201d pace in the next few years, in line\nwith the market, as the company is investing to remove\nproduction bottlenecks.  Clients can cut their costs by between 10 percent and 20\npercent if they choose one of the new newsprint grades,\naccording to Holmen. In the longer term, the company is also\nbetting on being able to sell more of its new papers in  emerging\nmarkets  such as  China  and  India  to tap the local growth in\nadvertising.
