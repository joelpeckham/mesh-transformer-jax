The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  Chief\nExecutive Officer  Richard Handler \u2019s pay for fiscal 2011 fell\n7.9 percent after the investment bank\u2019s shares slid 48 percent\nlast year and he declined a $4.88 million bonus.  Handler, 50, was awarded $14 million for the fiscal year\nended Nov. 30, compared with $15.2 million for the 11 months\nthrough November 2010, New York-based Jefferies said today in a\nfiling. The package included $1 million in salary and $13\nmillion in restricted-stock units that were granted in 2010.\nHandler elected to not receive a bonus for 2011. The firm\nshifted the end of its fiscal year to Nov. 30 in 2010.  The CEO worked to reassure investors, amid a 14 percent\nNovember stock slide, about the company\u2019s holdings in European\nsovereign debt after the Oct. 31 bankruptcy of MF Global\nHoldings Ltd. Handler cut the firm\u2019s  total assets  by 23 percent\nto $35 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter.  Jefferies climbed 39 percent this year to $19.11 yesterday.\nIt hit a 2 1/2-year low of $9.50 during trading on Nov. 17.  Handler told investors in December that he,  Brian Friedman ,\nchairman of the firm\u2019s executive committee, and other senior\nleaders gave back their bonuses for 2011, saying at the time\nshareholders had a \u201ctough year.\u201d Jefferies will \u201cprotect our\nscarce dollars\u201d by clawing back 2011 bonuses from any employee\nwho leaves for a competitor this year, Handler said in December.  Friedman\u2019s Award  Friedman was granted a $10.5 million package for fiscal\n2011, the filing shows, including a $750,000 salary and $9.75\nmillion in restricted stock units that were granted in 2010.\nChief Financial Officer Peregrine Broadbent received $1.88\nmillion.  The firm gave employees a choice for the stock-based\nportion of their annual bonuses. Workers could choose between\naccepting the firm\u2019s shares and taking cash at a 25 percent\ndiscount, a move that boosted Jefferies\u2019s cash-compensation\nexpense by $17.5 million, according to its annual report.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  cut CEO  James Gorman \u2019s 2011 pay 25 percent\nto $10.5 million as yearly profit dropped 13 percent and shares\nfell 44 percent, a person familiar with the plans said in\nJanuary.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  gave Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein a $7 million restricted-stock bonus for 2011, a\ndecrease from $12.6 million a year earlier.
