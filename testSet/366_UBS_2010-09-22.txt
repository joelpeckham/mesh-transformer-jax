 "context": "The following article called 'Lehman to File New Reorganization Plan, Says It's Cooperating With Probes' was published on 2010-09-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  plans\nto file a new reorganization plan in bankruptcy court by the\nfourth quarter and aims to win court approval by March 2011,\naccording to a regulatory filing.  The defunct New York-based securities firm said it aims to\ncut creditor claims to between $250 billion and $350 billion,\ndown from a total of $1.2 trillion earlier. Its filing was made\ntoday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Only\nafter winning approval of its plan can Lehman start to pay\ncreditors, it has said.  The \u201cbiggest obstacle\u201d to getting a plan approved has\nbeen dealing with foreign affiliates that are in their own\ninsolvency proceedings, Chief Executive Officer  Bryan Marsal \ntold U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  James Peck  in Manhattan today. \u201cI\nthink our patience is paying off,\u201d he said. Marsal originally\nhoped for plan approval by this month, he told Peck.  The former investment bank, which is liquidating over five\nyears, provided a progress report in court to Peck, two years\nafter filing the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.  Lehman is cooperating with \u201cvarious government\ninvestigations\u201d that started before and after the March\npublication of examiner  Anton Valukas \u2019s report on causes of the\nbankruptcy, according to the filing. No details were given.  Fees  Marsal, whose restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal LLC has\nbeen paid $342.4 million in fees for \u201cinterim management\u201d\nthrough August, told Peck that Lehman is pursuing \u201can\naggressive asset recovery strategy\u201d and has taken\n\u201cunorthodox\u201d steps in managing its real-estate assets.  Lehman and its affiliates now have $21 billion in cash and\nliquid investments, according to the filing. Lehman has a\nmonthly payroll of as much as $45 million for managers and\nadvisers including Marsal, while real estate and other\ninvestments it considers illiquid are being managed by 400\nemployees under a five-year plan. The company also is spending\ntens of millions of dollars on litigation that may stretch to at\nleast 2012.  After Marsal\u2019s report to Peck, the judge approved Lehman\u2019s\nplan to spend a total of $1.6 billion bailing out its two banks,\nWoodlands Commercial Bank in Salt Lake City and Aurora Bank FSB\nin Wilmington, Delaware, which it plans to sell or close. Lehman\nhas said the rescue will save creditors $3 billion.  Douglas Lambert , a managing director at Alvarez & Marsal,\nsaid at the hearing that Lehman will \u201cmost likely\u201d close the\nUtah bank and sell the Delaware bank.  Liquidation Cost  The cost to liquidate Lehman may reach $1 billion by the\nend of the month, based on the monthly payroll. Lehman paid its\nadvisers $44.6 million in fees in August, bringing the total to\n$961.3 million since its bankruptcy, according to a court\nfiling.  Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP  of New York, the investment\nbank\u2019s lead bankruptcy law firm, collected $220.9 million\nthrough Aug. 31.  Lehman has said it might be able to pay unsecured creditors\nabout 15 cents to 44 cents on the dollar.  Creditors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  UBS AG , the New\nYork Giants football club and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as\nwell as individuals who hold Lehman bonds.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,\nU.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York\n(Manhattan).
