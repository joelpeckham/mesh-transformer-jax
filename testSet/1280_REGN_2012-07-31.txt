The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. (REGN) , the\nmaker of the autoinflammatory drug Arcalyst, failed to win U.S.\napproval to expand the use of the medicine for patients\nundergoing gout treatments.  The  Food and Drug Administration  asked in a complete\nresponse letter for more data regarding the use of the injection\nto treat flares of joint pain caused by gout treatments, the\nTarrytown, New York-based company said yesterday in a statement.\nArcalyst was cleared for sale in February 2008 to treat a rare\ngenetic autoinflammatory disease.  FDA staff raised concerns in a May 4  report  that the\nbenefit of expanding the drug\u2019s use may be too small to justify\na 1 in 244 risk of developing cancer from taking the medicine.\nArcalyst was linked to six cases of malignancies, including\nprostate and breast cancers. Advisers to the agency recommended\nagainst approval of the new use citing inadequate safety data.  \u201cRegeneron is reviewing the complete response letter and\nwill determine appropriate next steps,\u201d George D. Yancopoulos,\npresident of Regeneron Laboratories, said in the statement.  Expanded approval would have added $128 million to $200\nmillion to Regeneron\u2019s annual sales of the drug by 2015,\naccording to two analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg earlier\nthis year. Arcalyst  generated  about $20 million for the company\nlast year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Regeneron declined less than 1 percent to $134.65 at the\nclose in  New York . The company\u2019s shares have more than doubled\nin the past 12 months.  FDA Request  The FDA also asked for information about chemistry,\nmanufacturing and controls related to a proposed new dosage form\nof the medicine, Regeneron said in the statement.  Gout treatments include  Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502) \u2019s Uloric\nand a generic version, allopurinol. They lower levels of uric\nacid, or bodily waste, that cause gout in excess levels, which\nmanifests through joint pain, according to the  National\nInstitutes of Health . Regeneron is seeking approval of Arcalyst\nto prevent gout flares for people initiating uric-acid lowering\ntherapies.  Allopurinol breaks up uric acid crystals that can cause\nflares of joint pain that may lead patients to stop taking their\nmedication, the company said. About 750,000 gout patients begin\ntaking allopurinol each year, according to Regeneron.
