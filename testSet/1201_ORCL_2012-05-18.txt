 "context": "The following article called 'BMC Buys Time as Sale Push Lifts Stock Most Since \u201908: Real M&A' was published on 2012-05-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBMC Software Inc. (BMC) \u2019s biggest stock\nrally in more than three years doesn\u2019t mean the company is going\nto agree to a takeover just yet.  BMC rose 8.7 percent on May 14, the most since October\n2008, after shareholder Elliott Associates LP urged the company\nto pursue a sale. The maker of software to manage corporate\n computer networks  said \u201cnow is not the right time\u201d to sell and\nadopted defenses against unwanted takeovers as it  trades  more\ncheaply relative to free cash flow than 89 percent of U.S.\nsoftware companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  After BMC posted the fifth-steepest  drop  in the Bloomberg\nAmericas Software Index since last year\u2019s  high , investors would\nneed a 37 percent premium to the stock\u2019s 20-day average to\nrecover those losses. While its enterprise software as well as\nmargins that are double the industry median may lure Dell Inc.,\n Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  or private equity, BMC is unlikely to get the $60-\na-share bids right now that it would probably consider, said  RBC\nCapital Markets . A purchase of the $6.8 billion company would\nalready be the biggest U.S. software acquisition since the start\nof the financial crisis, even without a premium, the data show.  \u201cIf you come out and say, \u2018We\u2019ll sell it immediately,\u2019 it\nwould almost seem like you\u2019re desperate,\u201d David Rudow, a\nMinneapolis-based analyst for Thrivent Asset Management, said in\na telephone interview. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hold out. There are not a\nlot of buyers out there that could even afford to do it. I do\nnot in any way fault them for saying no deal. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s\nmismanaged.\u201d  Thrivent, which oversaw $75.8 billion as of February, owned\n BMC shares  as of March 31, a regulatory filing showed.  \u2018Stockholder-Unfriendly Entrenchment\u2019  On May 14, Houston-based BMC said Elliott had amassed a\nmore than 5 percent stake and would seek five board seats and\npush for a sale. That prompted the company to adopt a\nstockholder rights plan to guard against hostile takeovers.  Tom Johnson , a spokesman for Elliott, declined to comment\non whether Elliott has received interest from potential buyers\nfor BMC. He referred to a letter from Jesse Cohn, a portfolio\nmanager at Elliott, that was sent to the company on May 15.  \u201cIt is Elliott\u2019s firm belief that BMC is currently\nattractive to multiple strategic acquirers,\u201d Cohn wrote. \u201cWe\nbelieve BMC could be attractive to private equity firms, and\nthat such a transaction could serve as another pathway to\ndeliver certain, premium value to stockholders.\u201d  Elliott, which oversees more than $20 billion, also\ncriticized BMC\u2019s board in the letter for implementing the poison\npill, calling the move \u201ca stockholder-unfriendly entrenchment\nmechanism generally derided as an instrument of poor corporate\ngovernance.\u201d  No Sale Committee  BMC said that while it \u201calways is open to alternatives\nthat fully reflect the value and prospects of the company,\u201d the\nboard determined that forming a special committee to pursue a\nsale isn\u2019t in investors\u2019 best interests at this time.  When asked if BMC has been approached by any buyers and at\nwhat price it would consider selling, a representative for the\ncompany declined to comment beyond its press release and the\nletter to Elliott this week.  BMC sells  software  that lets information technology\ndepartments better manage fleets of computer servers and\nmainframes, configuring new machines with the software they\nrequire and applying updates to older ones. The company is\ndivided into a unit that makes software for managing networks of\ncomputer servers, and another group for mainframe products.  \u2018More Time\u2019  Shares of BMC had fallen  29 percent  from its one-year high\nof $56.50 in July through last week, before Elliott\u2019s stake was\ndisclosed. The drop was the fifth-largest in the 42-company\n Bloomberg Americas Software Index. (BUSSFTW)  BMC\u2019s decline wiped out $3.5\nbillion in market value as higher-than-expected attrition rates\nreduced the average tenure and experience level of its sales\nforce and hurt productivity.  Even after this week\u2019s total  stock gain  of 4.9 percent, the\ncompany was valued yesterday at 9.4 times its cash from\noperations in the last 12 months after deducting capital\nexpenses. That\u2019s less than half the median valuation of 20.4\ntimes free cash flow for U.S. software makers with market values\ngreater than $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The poison pill \u201cgives management more time,\u201d Matthew Hedberg, an analyst at RBC in  Minneapolis , said in a phone\ninterview. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t force them to do something that\u2019s not in\nwhat they would say is their shareholders\u2019 best interest.\nFundamentally, they feel the stock price has upside from here\nand shouldn\u2019t be sold at a price based off of sort of trough\nexecution.\u201d  High Margins  After  net income  declined 12 percent in fiscal 2012,\nanalysts estimate that BMC will post record  profit  of $466\nmillion next year, which ends in March 2014. BMC\u2019s  operating\nmargin  of 25 percent of sales is almost double the industry\nmedian, the data show.  \u201cWhen you look at the operating margins of the company,\nthey\u2019re already pretty good, so it\u2019s not like this company has\nbeen terribly managed,\u201d Ben Rogoff, a London-based  fund manager \nwho helps oversee about $1 billion in technology assets at Polar\nCapital Partners LLC, said in a phone interview.  Elliott has been active in advocating for technology\nindustry deals in the past. Novell Inc. agreed to be bought by\nAttachmate Corp. for more than $2 billion in November 2010 after\nElliott\u2019s initial bid pushed the company to sell itself.  Strategic buyers, including Oracle and  Dell (DELL) , may be\nattracted to a takeover of BMC because of its expanding service\nmanagement business, which accounted for  62 percent  of the\ncompany\u2019s $2.2 billion of revenue last year, said RBC\u2019s Hedberg.  Dell, Oracle  \u201cIt\u2019s a very attractive asset that they have and it\u2019s a\nfaster growing business,\u201d Hedberg said. \u201cIt plays a very\nprominent role in today\u2019s data centers.\u201d  Dell, which holds almost $15 billion in cash and short-term\ninvestments, may only be interested in the one unit, without the\nmainframe business, Hedberg said.  With almost $30 billion in cash and short-term investments,\nOracle \u201ccould probably just buy it writing a check,\u201d Richard J. Moroney, chief investment officer at Horizon Investment Services\nLLC in Hammond,  Indiana , said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s right\nin their sweet spot in terms of big enough to move the dial a\nlittle bit and certainly very digestible.\u201d  David Frink , a spokesman for  Round Rock , Texas-based Dell,\nsaid the company doesn\u2019t comment on speculation, when asked\nwhether it would be interested in buying BMC.  Deborah Hellinger ,\na spokeswoman for  Redwood City , California-based Oracle, didn\u2019t\nrespond to a phone call or e-mail requesting comment.  \u2018It\u2019s Expensive\u2019  Another alternative would be to divest the mainframe\ncomputer software business, Polar Capital\u2019s Rogoff said. That\nunit accounted for about 38 percent of the company\u2019s sales last\nyear, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A private-equity firm may target BMC for its  cash flow ,\nMoroney said. After deducting capital expenses, the company\ngenerated cash from its operations in the past year equal to\nabout 10.7 percent of its stock price. That compares with an\naverage free  cash flow  yield of 5.2 percent for comparable\nsoftware companies, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  BMC\u2019s $6.8 billion market value would rank the company as\nthe eighth-largest U.S. software acquisition on record, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show. It would be the industry\u2019s largest\ntransaction since October 2007 -- at the start of the financial\ncrisis, the data show.  \u201cIt\u2019s expensive on an absolute basis and it\u2019s obviously\nmuch more difficult to sell something that will end up being $8\nbillion to $9 billion with a premium attached to it,\u201d Thrivent\u2019s\nRudow said. \u201cThe deal is so big, there\u2019s only a handful of\npotential acquirers out there who could do it.\u201d  Takeover Price  It would be hard for BMC\u2019s board to reject an offer as high\nas $60 a share because stockholders would \u201cjump at a chance to\nsell this if there really was a good offer,\u201d said Horizon\u2019s\nMoroney, who said his firm sold its BMC shares in April. A bid\nat that level would be 42 percent more than the stock\u2019s closing\nprice of $42.38 yesterday.  While RBC\u2019s Hedberg says $60 a share is a fair price based\non his sum-of-the-parts analysis, the company is unlikely to get\nsuch an offer.  \u201cI don\u2019t think right now anybody is really in the position\nto offer them $60,\u201d Hedberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic\nat this point.\u201d  It would be \u201ca stretch\u201d for a buyer to pay even $55 a share\nbecause BMC\u2019s high margins leave less room for improvement, said\nThrivent\u2019s Rudow. That would even be less than the stock\u2019s 2011\npeak of $56.50.  \u201cThis would definitely fit into that basket of assets that,\non a three-year view, you wouldn\u2019t expect to see as a standalone\nentity,\u201d Polar Capital\u2019s Rogoff said. Still, management is\nthinking now that \u201csomebody wants to \u2018steal\u2019 the company from us\nbefore we\u2019ve been given a proper chance to show what we can do.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nKatia Porzecanski in  New York  at \n kporzecansk1@bloomberg.net ;\nTara Lachapelle in New York at \n tlachapelle@bloomberg.net .
