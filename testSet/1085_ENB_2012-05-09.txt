 "context": "The following article called 'London Oil Trades Beat New York for First Time' was published on 2012-05-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLondon\u2019s oil futures market was\nbusier than its  New York  counterpart for the first time in at\nleast 17 years last month, reinforcing Brent crude\u2019s ascendant\nrole in setting global prices.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows investors traded 11.3 million\nBrent futures on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in April,\ncompared with 10.6 million West Texas Intermediate contracts,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the first\nmonth the London future had higher volumes than New York\u2019s since\n1995, the earliest period for which Bloomberg has figures.  \u201cWTI is suffering because of bottlenecks in the mid-\ncontinent that\u2019s causing localized weakness because you can\u2019t\nmove the oil to the Gulf of Mexico,\u201d said  Anthony Nunan ,\nassistant general manager for risk management at  Mitsubishi\nCorp. (8058)  in Tokyo. \u201cBigger funds don\u2019t want to deal with that, so\nBrent will be seen as a better overall proxy of the global\nmarketplace.\u201d  The delivery point for WTI purchased through the  New York\nMercantile Exchange  is Cushing, Oklahoma, which has insufficient\npipelines connecting it with refineries in Texas and Louisiana.\nThat\u2019s led to a glut of crude, prompting banks from Credit\nSuisse Group AG to  Barclays Capital  to question the viability of\nthe U.S. contract as a benchmark price.  WTI has traded at a discount to Brent since Aug. 17, 2010,\namid the surge in supply in Cushing as Canadian crude flowed\ninto the U.S. Midwest. There are several pipelines in the works\nto lessen the bottlenecks, with the Seaway project developed by\n Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  and Enterprise Product Partners LP scheduled to\nstart carrying about 150,000 barrels a day of crude to the Gulf\nCoast by the end of this month.  WTI\u2019s \u201crelevance\u201d to global oil markets is \u201cwaning\u201d as\ngauges including the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index have or will\nincrease weightings of Brent contracts, Barclays Capital said in\nOctober.
