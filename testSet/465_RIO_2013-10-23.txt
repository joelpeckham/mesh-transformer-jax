The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMadagascar is holding its first\npresidential vote since former disc jockey  Andry Rajoelina  took\npower in a military-backed coup in 2009 that left the nation\ngripped by international isolation and economic stagnation.  Thirty-three candidates are competing tomorrow to replace\nRajoelina, who deposed President  Marc Ravalomanana  almost five\nyears ago, causing the  African Union  to suspend the country and\ndonors including the U.S. to freeze at least  $400 million  in\naid. That forced the government to scale back services including\neducation,  water  and health care, deepening poverty in the\nworld\u2019s second-biggest vanilla-producing nation.  Among the top contenders are former Finance Minister Hery Rajaonarimampianina; Jean Louis Robinson, a medical doctor and\nformer cabinet minister under Ravalomanana; Roland Ratsiraka, a\nnephew of ex-President Didier Ratsiraka; and ex-Foreign Minister\nPierrot Rajaonarivelo.  \u201cEveryone is keen to avoid any semblance of unfair, un-free, violent elections,\u201d Robert Besseling, senior political\nadviser at IHS Global Insight, said by phone from Johannesburg\non Oct. 22. \u201cBut in the end none of the people running are the\nkey political influences in the country; they are proxies for\nRajoelina and former presidents Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka.\u201d  Rajoelina, Ratsiraka, Ravalomanana and his wife, Lalao, are\nbarred from running. The three men will remain influential\nfigures and still wield power from behind the scenes after the\nvote, U.S.-based Strategic Forecasting Inc. said in an e-mailed\nnote on Sept. 18.  \u201cBarring them from candidacy could result in a backlash as\ntheir supporters respond with violence,\u201d Stratfor said.  Economic Stagnation  Under Rajoelina, economic growth ground to a halt. The\n tourism industry , worth $390 million-a-year before the coup,\n declined  as much as 50 percent, and exports, especially\ntextiles, suffered after the U.S. suspended Madagascar from the\nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, which enables duty-free,\nquota-free access for some goods to the U.S. market.  The economy has posted  no growth  in the past four years,\ncompared with an average 5.7 percent annual expansion in the\nfour years before Rajoelina took power, according to\nInternational Monetary Fund data.  More than 90 percent of the country\u2019s 23 million people\nlives on less than $2 a day, according to the  World Bank . The\ncountry is  ranked  151 out of the 187 countries on United Nations\nHuman Development Index, which measures social and economic\nindicators.  Titanium Mine  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) , based in  London , has a $5 billion titanium\nmine in the country,  Canada \u2019s  Sherritt International Corp. (S)  has a\n40 percent stake in the Ambatovy nickel operation, and  Lemur\nResources Ltd. (LMR) , a Perth, Australia-based coal-exploration\ncompany, runs the Imaloto thermal-coal project.  The withdrawal of foreign aid, which previously accounted\nfor 40 percent of the budget, forced the government to slash\nexpenditure, according to a 2012 U.S. Congressional Research\nService report.  \u201cDevelopment challenges in Madagascar have been compounded\nby periodic political unrest that has hampered economic growth\nand limited public investment,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWith\nmost donor aid to the government currently suspended due to the\n2009 coup, public spending has dramatically decreased.\u201d  If no one wins 50 percent of support in the first round, a\nrun-off vote will be held on Dec. 20, along with parliamentary\nelections. More than 7.8 million registered voters are eligible\nto cast a ballot at about 20,000 polling stations across the\ncountry between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m.  Provisional results are expected between Nov. 2 and Nov. 8\nand the final outcome will be announced by Nov. 23, according to\nthe Antananarivo-based electoral commission\u2019s website.  \u201cThis election is important, as it should help us to end\nthe political crisis,\u201d said Juvence Ramasy, a political analyst\nwith the University of Toamasina. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if it will be\nable to do this.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAnnelie Rozeboom in Antananarivo at \n arozeboom@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nNasreen Seria at \n nseria@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Rio Tinto Plc was 30.461814880371094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Rio Tinto Plc was ",
