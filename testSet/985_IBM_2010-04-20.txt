 "context": "The following article called 'IBM Contract Signings Fall; Rebound May Come in Second Half' was published on 2010-04-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInternational Business Machines\nCorp. said signings of first-quarter service contracts fell,\nsignaling that spending on larger technology projects may not\npick up until the second half of the year.  \n Services signings, which account for more than half of\ntotal revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, IBM,\nthe world\u2019s largest computer-services provider, said yesterday\nin a statement. New contracts for application-management, which\nhelp clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent.  \n Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology\nprojects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst\nat Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent\ngain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could\npick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting\ncontracts are a leading indicator for other services.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s a slow thing to turn IT services,\u201d said Miedler, who\nrecommends buying IBM shares and doesn\u2019t own any. \u201cThose\ntransformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are\nmore open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.\u201d  \n IBM, based in Armonk, New York fell 2.2 percent to $129.38\nin late trading yesterday after rising $1.60 to $132.23 on the\nNew York Stock Exchange. It had gained 1 percent this year\nbefore today, compared with a 7.4 percent advance in the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  \n Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after\ndropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from\nMorgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support\nto that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales\nthat topped estimates.  \n Full-Year Forecast  \n IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last\nquarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in\napplication-management signings, services contracts would have\nbeen up 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that\u2019s\nslower growth than the fourth quarter\u2019s 9 percent increase.  \n Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency\nbasis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a\nconference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth\nin services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second\nquarter of last year declined 13 percent.  \n IBM said profit this year will be $11.20 a share, up from a\nprevious forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts predicted\n$11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  \n Still, the company has yet to signal that profit can rise\nbased on revenue growth rather than steps like costs cutting and\nstock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Broadpoint\nAmTech in San Francisco.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s a lackluster quarter,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cReally good\nfinancial management from an earnings perspective. At the end of\nthe day, not much from a revenue perspective.\u201d  \n Currency Effect  \n IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past\ndecade selling off hardware businesses and investing in its\nhigher-margin software and services units, which now make up\nmore than 80 percent of total revenue. That\u2019s helped it boost\ngross profit margins, the percentage of sales left after\nproduction costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year\nbasis.  \n Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the\nlowest in a year.  \n Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9\nbillion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,\nrevenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said.  \n \u201cThe Street has been looking for better organic revenue\nwhen you net out FX,\u201d said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO\nCapital Markets in New York. He rates IBM \u201coutperform\u201d and\ndoesn\u2019t own shares.  \n Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five\nacquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and\nNational Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related\nprograms. U.S. government plans to put patient health records\nonline may spur more than $20 billion in spending, Framingham,\nMassachusetts-based researcher IDC said.  \n First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a\nshare, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nKatie Hoffmann in New York at \n khoffmann4@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                           \n                 \n                 \n                                       \n                                   \n               \n                        \n           \n                          April 20 (Bloomberg) -- Andy Miedler, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri, talks with Bloomberg's Susan Li about International Business Machines Corp.'s performance and growth outlook.\n     IBM said service contract signings fell last quarter, suggesting corporate customers are still delaying some technology spending following the economic slowdown.
