 "context": "The following article called 'Disney Telling Advertisers of Live ABC App in Mobile Push' was published on 2013-05-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) \u2019s ABC network, staking\na claim to growth in online video ads, will brief advertisers\nnext week on a service providing live shows on mobile phones and\ntablets, people with knowledge of the plan said.  Watch ABC, a first-of-its-kind application from a\nbroadcaster, will stream live and archived shows to pay-TV\nsubscribers, said the people, who sought anonymity because the\nplans aren\u2019t public. It could be released near the new TV season\nin September, they said.  With online video ad sales growing faster than network TV\nrevenue, Disney and other programmers such as News Corp.\u2019s Fox\nare developing ways to let audiences watch away from home on\nsmartphones and products such as Apple Inc.\u2019s iPad. The move\npits entertainment companies against  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s YouTube and\n Facebook Inc. (FB)  for an ad market that  Morgan Stanley (MS)  predicts will\ngrow 18 percent to $2.73 billion this year.  \u201cWhile the audience online is still small, it\u2019s growing\nfast and represents one of the biggest opportunities for the\nmedia companies,\u201d Ben Swinburne, a Morgan Stanley analyst in\n New York , said in an interview.  As with Watch ESPN, the mobile TV service offered by\nBurbank, California-based Disney\u2019s sports channel, Watch ABC\nrepresents a potential new revenue source. The network will\noutline the product to advertisers in New York next week during\nupfront sales presentations for the September 2013 TV season.  \u2018Already Talking\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019re already talking as it relates to ABC and the\nupfronts of selling packages to advertisers that go across all\nmedia,\u201d Disney Chief Executive Officer  Robert Iger  said May 7\non a conference call.  Disney rose 0.9 percent to $66.58 in New York, another all-time closing high. The stock has  advanced  34 percent this year,\nsecond most in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) , which is up 15\npercent.  Broadcast networks will receive about $9.18 billion in\nadvance ad commitments, a 1.2 percent increase from a year ago,\nSwinburne wrote in an April 25 report. Cable programmers will\nget $10.7 billion, a 6 percent gain, he wrote.  All four major broadcast networks offer some programming on\ncomputers, tablets and smartphones. Later this year, Fox plans\nto release Fox Now, an app giving pay-TV viewers expanded on-demand access to recent shows. News Corp. is releasing similar\napps for F/X, Fox Sports and NatGeo, said Mike Hopkins,\npresident of distribution for Fox Networks Group.  Live streaming will come later, he said in an interview.  CBS Approach  CBS Corp. (CBS) \u2019s TV network and Comcast Corp.\u2019s NBC have\nreleased ad-supported apps that don\u2019t require viewers to have a\npay-TV subscription, like an earlier version of ABC\u2019s product.\nThe apps offer access to some archived programs.  CBS last month acquired a stake in Syncbak, a company that\nworks with local stations to stream their shows online.  Such services could head off the challenge posed by Aereo\nInc., which captures broadcasters\u2019 over-the-air signals and\nretransmits them to subscribers on tablets and smartphones.  ABC\u2019s step marks the biggest effort yet by a broadcaster to\ncapture the nation\u2019s 101 million pay-TV subscribers while\nthey\u2019re away from the living-room set and more apt to be posting\non Facebook or watching a YouTube video.  The network\u2019s \u201cModern Family\u201d and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d draw\nviewers that advertisers want, unlike the user-generated, low-budget clips on YouTube, Swinburne wrote.  \u201cMuch of the YouTube inventory is not attractive for\ntraditional brand advertising,\u201d he wrote.  Local News  With the Watch ABC app, a cable subscriber will be able to\nview programs on the road or in a room where there\u2019s no TV, as\nlong as there\u2019s a Web connection. The service can provide\ntravelers access to their local ABC station from anywhere.  By limiting the service to pay TV customers, it puts mobile\naccess behind a paywall and protects the fees that the network\u2019s\neight owned stations and many affiliate broadcasters collect\nfrom services like  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  and  DirecTV. (DTV)   \u201cThey\u2019re creating something viewers want and creating a\nnew revenue stream,\u201d said  Jay Baum , executive vice president\nand director of national broadcast buying for the advertising\ncompany Deutsch, whose clients include DirecTV and PNC Bank.  Last June, Disney released Watch Disney Channel, which lets\npay TV viewers with a mobile device see a live feed of the cable\nnetwork and archived shows. Disney Channel applications,\nincluding ones for Disney XD and Disney Junior, have been\ndownloaded more than 13 million times, according to the company.\nThe existing ABC Player, introduced in 2010, has been downloaded\nabout 10 million times. Unlike the new product, it doesn\u2019t offer\nlive TV or as extensive library access.  Online Ratings  One challenge facing all of the programmers, cable and\nbroadcast, is measuring online audiences and demonstrating to\nmarketers that they are reaching the viewers they expect.  Currently the ratings distributor Nielsen only counts\nonline audiences for a show when it\u2019s seen within three days of\nits original airdate and only when the commercials are the same.  That excludes later viewing on digital video recorders, on\na TV network\u2019s website or on Hulu.com, the ad-supported site\nowned by Disney,  News Corp. (NWSA)  and Comcast\u2019s  NBC Universal .  In next week\u2019s meetings with advertisers, Disney will\noutline plans to use Nielsen\u2019s  online campaign ratings , a system\nfor counting Internet audiences, Swinburne said.  \u201cThe key is to get a measurement system in place that\nallows us to monetize, because I\u2019m convinced there\u2019s a lot of\nconsumption going on there,\u201d Iger said on the call.
