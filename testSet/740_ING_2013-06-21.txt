 "context": "The following article called 'ECB Bank Oversight Start Said to Be Delayed to Late 2014' was published on 2013-06-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe European Central Bank probably\nwon\u2019t take over as euro-area bank supervisor until the final\nmonths of 2014, further delaying the banking union that leaders\nwanted in place quickly to stem the sovereign debt crisis.  Late next year is now the time line for the transition to\nthe new banking supervision regime, in part because of German\napproval procedures, according to two European officials who\nspoke on condition of anonymity because the preparations are\nongoing. The new schedule contrasts with an initial goal of\nmoving to the system in March, later pushed back to July.  The Frankfurt-based central bank won\u2019t be able to take up\nits new role until September at the earliest, ECB Executive\nBoard member Yves Mersch said in an interview with\nd\u2019Letzebuerger Land newspaper published today. German Finance\nMinister Wolfgang Schaeuble said yesterday it\u2019s \u201cnonsense\u201d to\nblame  Germany  for delaying ECB oversight, as the nation\u2019s\napproval processes had been clearly set out.  The ECB\u2019s new role will be a turning point for the currency\nzone because it will follow the central bank\u2019s first-ever look\nat bank balance sheets, which will start in the fourth quarter\nof this year and conclude before the new oversight begins. It\nalso may be the start date for new backstop tools such as direct\naid from the 500 billion-euro ($660 billion) European Stability\nMechanism.  As a result, postponing the new supervision regime could\nreopen questions about whether EU leaders will follow through on\npromises to break the link between banks and sovereigns. Over\nthe past three years, five of the euro area\u2019s 17 nations have\nsought bailouts and investors remain jittery that contagion\ncould flare up again.  \u2018Easiest Part\u2019  \u201cIt matters symbolically and sends out the message that\nthe euro zone is not even able to fix the easiest part of\nbanking union,\u201d said  Carsten Brzeski , senior economist at ING\n Belgium , said by e-mail.  Spanish 10-year bond yields surged the most in 11 months\nyesterday after the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s announcement that it\nmay end bond purchases in mid-2014 disrupted the relative calm\non European debt markets that has prevailed since the ECB\nunveiled its OMT plan last year. The rate on Italian 10-year\ndebt fell 5 basis points today after surging 29 basis points to\n4.55 percent yesterday and  Portugal \u2019s 10-year yields rose 2\nbasis points today after jumping 34 basis points to 6.41\npercent.  Part of the delay comes from German legislative procedures\nthat limit the European Parliament\u2019s ability to sign off on the\nlegislation. Germany\u2019s lower house, or Bundestag, approved the\neuro area\u2019s Single Supervisory Mechanism on June 13 and it\nprobably will be voted on in the upper house on July 5.  \u201cThe German legislature is not to blame for any delays in\nEurope,\u201d Schaeuble said after a meeting of euro-region finance\nministers in Luxembourg yesterday. \u201cWe\u2019ve said early enough\nthat we need ratification for the SSM by means of a legislative\nprocess.\u201d  Bank Resolution  That\u2019s right after the European Parliament\u2019s next plenary\nsession, set for July 1-4 in Strasbourg,  France . Lawmakers have\nsaid they are unwilling to vote on the plans until the German\nparliament has approved them, and so confirmed it won\u2019t seek\nchanges. As a result, EU lawmakers won\u2019t have a chance to vote\nuntil September at the earliest.  The law then requires a one-year transition period, which\nthe ECB can extend at its discretion.  \u201cWe still don\u2019t have any final certainty about when the\ndraft law will be accepted by the European Parliament,\u201d Mersch\nsaid in the newspaper paper. \u201cBefore the European Parliament\nvotes the national procedures have to be completed. If the\nEuropean Parliament postpones the voting date because of the\nsummer holiday until September, we can only take up our work one\nyear later -- so at the earliest in September 2014.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nRebecca Christie in  Luxembourg  at \n rchristie4@bloomberg.net ;\nJeff Black in Luxembourg at \n jblack25@bloomberg.net ;\nRainer Buergin in Luxembourg at \n rbuergin1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJames Hertling at \n jhertling@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was 6.730660438537598 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was ",
