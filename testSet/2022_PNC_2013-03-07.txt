 "context": "The following article called 'The Best Way Yet to Proclaim Love for a Tax Cheat' was published on 2013-03-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nErnst & Young LLP received the usual\nkid-glove treatment given to too-big-to-fail enterprises when it\nreached a  settlement  with the U.S. Justice Department over\nillegal tax shelters it sold more than a decade ago. The\ngovernment chose not to prosecute the Big Four accounting firm,\nand Ernst is getting off by writing a relatively small check.  The $123 million that Ernst must pay is equivalent to the\nfees it charged for the tax shelters in question. About 200\nErnst clients used the shelters to try to avoid more than $2\nbillion in taxes. The firm doesn\u2019t even have to pay interest on\nthe ill-gotten proceeds, under the deal revealed last week.  Two Ernst tax specialists were sentenced to prison, while\ntwo others had their convictions reversed last year on appeal.\nErnst was required to admit that some of its personnel engaged\nin criminal wrongdoing. All in all, the firm came out fine. The\npublic had forgotten about the investigation years ago.  Yet there was one area where Ernst made out beyond all\nreason: A veritable love letter at the bottom of the  statement\nof facts  that Ernst and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the\nSouthern District of New York agreed to as part of their accord.\nIt said: \u201cThe wrongdoing in this case by a small group of\nprofessionals at E&Y represented a deviation from the more than\n100-year history of ethical and professional conduct by E&Y and\nits partners.\u201d  To which one can only respond: What? I asked Julie Bolcer,\na spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney, what the factual basis was\nfor the statement. She declined to comment. Amy Call Well, an\nErnst spokeswoman, declined to answer the same question.  The best way to show the sentence\u2019s problems is with a\ntimeline. My space is limited. So rather than cover 100 years, I\ndecided to go as far back as the merger between Arthur Young &\nCo. and Ernst & Whinney that created  Ernst & Young  in 1989. The\nfirm has been in trouble over ethical violations and\nprofessional misconduct on a regular basis ever since. To wit:  1990  -- The Securities and Exchange Commission  barred  Ernst from\naccepting new public-company audit work in the New York region\nfor 45 days, after accusing it of professional  misconduct  during\nits audits a decade earlier at Norwalk, Connecticut-based U.S.\nSurgical Corp.  1991  -- The SEC  sued  Ernst over auditor-independence  violations ,\nafter finding that RepublicBank Corp., an audit client, lent\nmillions of dollars to the firm\u2019s partners and to tax-shelter,\nreal-estate partnerships in which they invested. The case was\n settled  in 1995. A judge ordered Ernst to comply with the SEC\u2019s\nindependence rules.  1992  -- Ernst paid  $400 million  to resolve government claims\nrelated to the 1980s savings-and-loan crisis.  1999  -- Ernst paid $335 million to  settle  investor lawsuits over\nits certifications of fraudulent financial statements at Cendant\nCorp. The SEC later suspended  two  Ernst  partners , saying they\naided the company\u2019s securities-law violations.  2003  -- Documents in an Arkansas court case showed that Ernst\nand other Big Four accounting firms had routinely  overbilled \nclients for travel expenses by charging them full fare for\nairline tickets while pocketing large rebates they had\nnegotiated in volume-discount contracts with carriers. Ernst\nreached an $18 million class-action  settlement  and said it\nstopped the practice.  -- Former Ernst partner Thomas Trauger was  arrested  on\ncharges of obstructing government investigations. He later\npleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year in prison for\ndestroying documents related to the firm\u2019s audits of NextCard\nInc., a credit-card issuer. Two other former Ernst auditors\nentered guilty pleas in related cases.  -- Richard Bobrow, Ernst\u2019s global chief executive, left the\nfirm after his attempts to conceal his wealth during divorce\nproceedings backfired. The partnership\u2019s innermost financial\ndetails were disclosed after the  New York Times  asked a judge to\nmake the records public. Bobrow was in the job for about a year.  --  Sprint Corp.  replaced Ernst as its auditor after the\nInternal Revenue Service began reviewing tax shelters the firm\nsold to top Sprint executives, who were forced out by the\ncompany\u2019s board earlier that year.  2004  -- The SEC  barred  Ernst from accepting new public-company\naudit clients for six months over auditor-independence\nviolations, after uncovering a revenue-sharing agreement Ernst\nhad with PeopleSoft Inc. when it was the company\u2019s auditor.  -- Ernst agreed to pay  $125 million  to settle banking\nregulators\u2019 claims over its audits of Hinsdale, Illinois-based\nSuperior Bank FSB, which collapsed in 2001.  2007  -- Ernst was censured by the SEC and paid $1.6 million to\nsettle the agency\u2019s claims of professional  misconduct  and\nauditor-independence violations related to its audit work for\nPNC Financial Services Group Inc.  2008  -- The SEC censured Ernst and two partners for  professional\nmisconduct  over a business relationship between the firm and a\ndirector on the boards of three Ernst audit  clients , including\nBest Buy Co. Ernst paid $2.9 million to settle the SEC\u2019s claims\nof auditor-independence violations.  2009  -- A jury  convicted  former Ernst attorney and partner James Gansman on six felony counts of tipping his girlfriend about\nacquisition targets of Ernst clients. Gansman was sentenced to a\nyear in prison.  -- Ernst paid $109 million to settle investor lawsuits over\nits audits for HealthSouth Corp., which disclosed a huge\naccounting fraud in 2003.  -- The SEC fined Ernst $8.5 million and disciplined six\npartners, including the former head of Ernst\u2019s national office,\nfor  professional misconduct  in approving fraudulent financial\nstatements at Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.  2010  -- The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  censured \nErnst audit manager Jacqueline Higgins for \u201cimproper removal,\naddition, and backdating of audit documentation prior to a board\ninspection.\u201d  2012  -- The accounting oversight board  censured  Ernst and fined\nthe firm $2 million for auditing-standard violations at Medicis\nPharmaceutical Corp. Four Ernst auditors also were sanctioned.  -- The Senate Permanent  Subcommittee  on Investigations\nreleased a report that  criticized  Ernst\u2019s tax advice for audit\nclient Hewlett-Packard Co., saying it was clear that some H-P\ntransactions approved by Ernst had been done in an attempt to\ncircumvent U.S. tax laws.  -- The SEC  suspended  Ernst auditor Wendy McNeeley for\nprofessional misconduct during the 2004 audit of AA Capital\nPartners Inc.  Aside from those episodes (and a bunch of others I left\nout, such as the firm\u2019s see-no-evil  audits  for Lehman Brothers\nHoldings Inc.), it surely is accurate to say that most of\nErnst\u2019s thousands of employees usually act ethically and\nprofessionally. It\u2019s also true that the Justice Department was\nwrong to make the sweeping generalization that it did on Ernst\u2019s\nbehalf. The firm has so many well-known blemishes on its record\nthat this couldn\u2019t have been an oversight of ignorance.  It would be nice to believe the prosecutors were on the\npublic\u2019s side here. Unfortunately it seems they were more\nconcerned about protecting Ernst than they were anyone else.
