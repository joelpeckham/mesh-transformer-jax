 "context": "The following article called 'Europe Stocks May Drop 10 Percent: Technical Analysis' was published on 2013-09-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEuro-area stocks  may drop as much as\n10 percent by the end of October if the region\u2019s benchmark index\ncloses below its 50-day moving average, a technical analyst from\nING Bank NV said.  Closing below 2,739 will confirm a bearish trend for the\n Euro Stoxx 50 (SX5E)  Index, with the next support at 2,673. The gauge\nmay fall as low as 2,470 in the coming weeks as a so-called\nbroadening formation develops, according to Roelof-Jan van den Akker.  A broadening formation is a pattern that shows uncertainty,\nwith sharp volatile price movements within its boundaries.  \u201cMomentum is deteriorating, confirming the current\ndifficult status of the market,\u201d Van den Akker said by\ntelephone from Amsterdam. \u201cRight now, it looks like a normal\ndecline without panic. But I don\u2019t see any signs of a bottom\nwithin this decline, which tells me we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d  The Euro Stoxx 50 fell 3.7 percent to 2,721.37 last week\namid concern that possible military action by the U.S. against\nSyria may escalate into a larger conflict in the  Middle East  and\npush up  oil prices . The gauge rose 0.6 percent to 2,774.45 at\n1:44 p.m. in London today.
