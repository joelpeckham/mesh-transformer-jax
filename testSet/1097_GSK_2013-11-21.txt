 "context": "The following article called 'BioMarin Seen Luring $13 Billion Takeover Bid: Real M&A' was published on 2013-11-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN)  may\ndraw bidders to the biggest biotechnology deal in three years\nafter its most promising rare-disease drug came one step closer\nto U.S. regulatory approval this week.  An advisory committee to the  Food and Drug Administration \nsaid this week that BioMarin\u2019s Vimizim drug should be approved\nto treat the rare metabolic disease Morquio A syndrome. A\nfavorable FDA ruling by the end of February would remove some\nrisk for acquirers and may encourage them to pay a premium for\nthe  $9.8 billion company , Robert W. Baird & Co. said.  Vimizim, which would be BioMarin\u2019s fifth orphan drug to hit\nthe market, is  projected  by analysts to be the company\u2019s best-selling therapy by 2017. Large drugmakers such as  Pfizer (PFE)  Inc.\nand GlaxoSmithKline Plc may covet BioMarin\u2019s treatments that\ntarget concentrated markets and sell for higher prices, said\nJanney Montgomery Scott LLC. BioMarin could fetch at least $93 a\nshare, said William Blair & Co. At about $13 billion, it would\nbe the largest deal for a pharmaceutical or biotechnology\ncompany since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good acquisition candidate given big pharma\u2019s\ninterest in the orphan drug development space and given\nBioMarin\u2019s deep pipeline,\u201d Kimberly Lee, a San Francisco-based\nmanaging director and analyst at financial services firm Janney,\nsaid in a phone interview. Approval of Vimizim would \u201cincrease\ntheir attractiveness.\u201d  FDA Approval  Debra Charlesworth, a spokeswoman for  San Rafael ,\nCalifornia-based BioMarin, declined to comment when asked if the\ncompany would be interested in a sale.  An advisory committee to the FDA voted on Nov. 19 to\nrecommend that Vimizim be approved for sale in the U.S. A\nmajority of the panel said it should be approved for all\npatients with  Morquio A syndrome , a rare genetic disorder that\ncauses skeletal malformation. The FDA, which isn\u2019t required to\nfollow the advisers\u2019 recommendation, is scheduled to make its\ndecision on the drug by Feb. 28.  Today, BioMarin shares rose 2.4 percent to $70.82, after\nincreasing 3.3 percent yesterday on news of the advisory\ncommittee\u2019s vote.  Vimizim may generate $416 million in annual revenue by\n2017, more than the projected sales for any of BioMarin\u2019s drugs\nalready on the market, according to analysts\u2019  estimates  compiled\nby Bloomberg. The company  currently sells  enzyme replacement\ntherapies Naglazyme and Aldurazyme, Kuvan for metabolic genetic\ndisorder PKU and Firdapse for the autoimmune disease Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome.  Orphan Drugs  Large drugmakers \u201cdo want good products and growing\nproducts, and with Vimizim now very likely to get to the market,\nthat\u2019s another one of those in BioMarin\u2019s portfolio,\u201d  Phil Nadeau , a New York-based analyst at Cowen Group Inc., said in a\nphone interview. \u201cBioMarin is a good candidate and probably a\nlikely candidate at this point to be acquired.\u201d  Orphan drugs such as those sold by BioMarin command premium\nprices of as much as $400,000 a year per patient and target\ndiseases that affect as few as 5,000 to 10,000 people worldwide.\nThe market has attracted interest from larger pharmaceutical\ncompanies seeking to boost earnings as mass-market pills lose\npatent protection, with Shire Plc agreeing this month to buy\nrare-disease drugmaker  ViroPharma Inc. (VPHM)  for about $4.2 billion.  BioMarin would likely command takeover bids of at least $93\na share, according to Tim Lugo, a San Francisco-based analyst at\nWilliam Blair. That would be a 35 percent premium to yesterday\u2019s\nclosing price of $69.14.  Takeover Valuation  \u201cThere are only a limited number of companies that do rare\ndiseases well and BioMarin is at the top of the list,\u201d Lugo\nsaid in a phone interview.  At that price, the deal would cost at least $13 billion,\nthe most for a biotechnology or pharmaceutical deal since  Sanofi (SAN) \nagreed to buy orphan drugmaker Genzyme Corp. in 2010, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. The cash bid was ultimately\nraised to about $20 billion.  Given its position in the market for rare disease\ntreatments after acquiring Genzyme, Sanofi could be among large\npharmaceutical companies interested in buying BioMarin, Nadeau\nof Cowen said.  Glaxo (GSK)  or Pfizer are also potential suitors, said\nLee of Janney.  Jack Cox, a spokesman for Paris-based Sanofi, and Joan Campion of New York-based Pfizer said the companies don\u2019t\ncomment on speculation when asked about a potential takeover of\nBioMarin. Representatives for London-based Glaxo didn\u2019t respond\nto a request for comment.  \u2018Too Expensive\u2019  DealReporter said in a Sept. 19 report that  Roche Holding\nAG  was lining up $15 billion in debt financing for an\nacquisition of BioMarin. Roche CEO Severin Schwan responded\nlater that day, saying the company wasn\u2019t raising funds for a\ndeal.  \u201cWe are scratching our heads\u201d at valuations in the\nbiotechnology industry, Schwan said in an interview at the time.\nAs of yesterday, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index had gained 54\npercent this year, while BioMarin rose  41 percent  to add $3.7\nbillion to its market value.  Other potential buyers may feel the same way, said Liana Moussatos of Wedbush Inc.  \u201cI\u2019m sure plenty of companies would love to be able to\nbuy\u201d BioMarin, Moussatos, a San Francisco-based analyst, said\nin a phone interview. \u201cExcept it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d  BioMarin  trades  at about 17 times its trailing 12-month\nrevenue of $534 million, compared with the price-sales multiple\nof almost 5 times paid in the acquisition of Genzyme. In 2016,\nBioMarin is projected to post its first  profit  in six years,\nanalysts\u2019 estimates show.  With large pharmaceutical companies more willing to pay up\nfor biotechnology targets with proven products and fewer risks,\nthe advisory committee\u2019s backing of Vimizim may help ease those\nconcerns, said Christopher Raymond of Baird.  BioMarin is \u201cright in the wheelhouse of attractiveness in\nterms of being in the rare disease space,\u201d Raymond, a Chicago-based analyst, said in a phone interview. A takeover \u201cis\nabsolutely a possibility.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nBrooke Sutherland in  New York  at \n bsutherland7@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSarah Rabil at \n srabil@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of GlaxoSmithKline PLC was 34.043331146240234 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of GlaxoSmithKline PLC was ",
