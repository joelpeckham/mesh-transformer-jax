 "context": "The following article called 'JPMorgan FERC-Probe Records Sought by Senate Investigators' was published on 2013-08-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. Senate Permanent\nSubcommittee on Investigations asked energy-market regulators to\nhand over \u201ckey documents\u201d from a probe of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \nas lawmakers examine banks\u2019 roles in commodities markets.  Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who leads the panel, and\nJohn McCain of  Arizona , its ranking Republican, sent a letter to\nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission seeking records from\nthe agency\u2019s inquiry and settlement with JPMorgan, according to\na copy of the Aug. 2 request obtained by Bloomberg News.  The lawmakers asked the FERC to include a 70-page document\noutlining investigators\u2019 findings, which was cited in articles\nby the  New York  Times. The regulator kept that document private\nwhen announcing a $410 million accord with JPMorgan last month.  The committee has repeatedly investigated Wall Street firms\nin the wake of 2008\u2019s credit crisis, chronicling Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc.\u2019s sales of mortgage-linked instruments and JPMorgan\u2019s\nhandling of botched derivatives bets. In an interview last\nmonth, Levin said lawmakers would use subpoena power to examine\nbanks\u2019 dealings in physical commodities.  \u201cWe have been into this issue for a long time and it\u2019s a\nvery, very significant issue,\u201d Levin said July 23 of his\npanel\u2019s look at banks\u2019 businesses tied to energy and natural\nresources. The potential for conflicts of interest or price\nmanipulation \u201cis huge,\u201d he said.  Spokesmen for the FERC, the bank, the Senate panel and\nLevin\u2019s and McCain\u2019s offices declined to comment on the\nlawmakers\u2019 request or didn\u2019t respond to messages. The letter was\nreported earlier this month by Platts, a publisher of\ncommodities market prices and news.  Abusive Bidding  JPMorgan\u2019s energy-trading unit engaged in 12 bidding\nstrategies in wholesale energy markets from September 2010 to\nNovember 2012 that resulted in tens of millions of dollars in\noverpayments from grid operators, the FERC said while announcing\nits settlement in July.  The bank accepted the facts in the FERC settlement without\nadmitting or denying wrongdoing, the agency said. The firm\nannounced last month that it was looking to exit the physical\ncommodities business, which includes energy trading.  Justice Department  Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat on the Senate\nBanking Committee, held a subcommittee hearing last month on\nfinancial firms\u2019 involvement in commodities. He said he plans to\nhold his next hearing on the topic as soon as September.  Senators Elizabeth Warren and  Edward Markey , both\nMassachusetts Democrats, sent a separate letter to the FERC in\nJuly, seeking more details on the regulator\u2019s probe of JPMorgan.\nThey asked why the agency didn\u2019t target \u201cexecutives who planned\nand executed market manipulations or who impeded the\ncommission\u2019s investigations.\u201d  The Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation\nare conducting their own examination of whether criminal laws\nwere violated by individuals, a person briefed on the matter\nsaid last week. That inquiry, which focuses on conduct at issue\nin the FERC\u2019s case, is in an early stage.
