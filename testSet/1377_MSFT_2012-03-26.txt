 "context": "The following article called 'Nokia to Sell $99.99 Windows Phone Via AT&T to Take On Apple' was published on 2012-03-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAT&T Inc. (T)  plans to start selling a\nNokia Oyj smartphone with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  software for half of\nwhat it charges for the iPhone, as the device\u2019s makers seek to\nbreak  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s dominance of the U.S. market.  The Lumia 900, which runs on AT&T\u2019s network using faster,\nso-called long-term-evolution technology, will start selling for\n$99.99 on April 8, the second-largest U.S. wireless carrier said\ntoday in a statement. The latest iPhone and newest handsets\nrunning Google\u2019s Android software typically start at $199.  Nokia is counting on Microsoft\u2019s Windows Phone software to\nreignite sales in the U.S., where the iPhone, Android makers\nsuch as  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) \u2019s\nBlackBerry control 92 percent of the market. Microsoft is trying\nto increase its share of the mobile software market to expand\nbeyond the slower-growing personal-computer market.  \u201cThe pricing is aggressive,\u201d said Avi Greengart, an\nanalyst at research firm Current Analysis in Teaneck,  New\nJersey . \u201cThey are hoping to use price to get people to buy a\nproduct with an operating system they aren\u2019t familiar with.\u201d  To get the $99.99 price, customers need to sign up to a\ntwo-year contract with AT&T. The Dallas-based carrier will also\nsell the phone without a contract for $449.99, said Steven\nSchwadron, an AT&T spokesman.  Those price points suggest that AT&T is subsidizing each\nLumia by about $350. That compares with a $450 subsidy for the\nthe cheapest version iPhone 4S, which sells for $199 with a\ncontract and $649 without one.  Must Win  Nokia Chief Executive Officer Stephen Elop, a former\nMicrosoft executive, started rebuilding the Espoo, Finland-based\ncompany\u2019s smartphone strategy around the Windows Phone operating\nsystem last year. Nokia had previously focused on its own MeeGo\nand Symbian operating systems.  Nokia and Microsoft have said they are willing to spend\nmoney to fuel sales. Microsoft said last year it would pay Nokia\n$1 billion to develop and promote Windows phones. Elop said in\nOctober that marketing spending on the Lumia series would be\ntriple the money spent on previous product sales promotions.  Microsoft, based in Redmond,  Washington ,  rose  1.8 percent\nto $32.59 at the close in New York. Nokia  advanced  0.4 percent\nat 3.99 euros in Helsinki. AT&T added 0.9 percent to $31.79.  The Lumia 900 has a 4.3-inch (11-centimeter) screen, larger\nthan that of the iPhone, and an 8-megapixel camera. Customers\ncan order it online starting March 30, AT&T said.
