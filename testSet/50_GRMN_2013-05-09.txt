 "context": "The following article called 'Groupon Surges as Sales Top Estimates on Mobile: Chicago Mover' was published on 2013-05-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGroupon Inc. (GRPN)  shares jumped the most in\nmore than two months after the daily deal website\u2019s first-quarter revenue surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates, buoyed by\nincreased coupon sales through its mobile applications.  Groupon  shares  rose 11 percent to $6.23 at the close in New\nYork, the biggest gain since March 1. The stock has advanced 28\npercent this year, compared with a 14 percent gain in the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  Co-Chief Executive Officers Eric Lefkofsky and Ted Leonsis\nhave helped stabilize the company while they search for a\nreplacement for Andrew Mason, the Groupon co-founder they ousted\nas CEO in February amid faltering growth. The company\u2019s apps for\nmobile devices and new personalization features are helping\nGroupon expand its share of the daily deal market, said  Tom Forte , an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group in New York.  \u201cThey are taking share of the North American deals market\nfrom LivingSocial and from Google,\u201d Forte said in an interview.\n\u201cThey outperformed against some modest expectations.\u201d  First-quarter sales rose 7.5 percent to $601.4 million, the\nChicago-based company said yesterday in a statement. Analysts on\naverage projected $591 million, according to  data  compiled by\nBloomberg. The net loss narrowed to $3.99 million, or 1 cent a\nshare, from $11.7 million, or 2 cents, a year earlier. Analysts\nhad estimated a loss of 2 cents.  Revenue in the current period will be $575 million to $625\nmillion, the company said in the statement. That compares with\nan average analyst estimate of $617.7 million.  Mobile Sales  North American revenue in the first quarter climbed 42\npercent to $339.6 million, while  international  sales fell 18\npercent to $261.8 million. That drop also represented the fourth\nstraight sequential decline in overseas revenue.  Coupons sold on mobile devices accounted for 45 percent of\nall transactions in North America in March, up from less than 30\npercent a year earlier, the company said. The increase was\ndriven by product improvements such as mobile search as well as\ngrowth in the number of local deals offered via wireless\ndevices, Chief Financial Officer Jason Child said in an\ninterview.  \u201cMobile is the key story in North America,\u201d Child said.  The company makes money by offering consumers discounts --\nknown as Groupons -- from businesses such as restaurants and\nnail salons. It then shares the revenue with the businesses.  Groupon Goods  Groupon Goods, a service started in 2011 to help retail\ncompanies such as  Dell Inc. (DELL)  and  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN)  peddle thousands of\nmarked-down items via two-day sales, totaled $165.4 million in\nbillings in the first quarter, more than double from a year\nearlier, when the unit contributed $78.2 million in billings.\nBillings represent the total value of items sold through the\nsite.  Mason was fired on Feb. 28, a day after the company\nforecast first-quarter sales that missed estimates, causing the\nstock to plunge 25 percent. Pressure had been mounting on\nGroupon to seek a new CEO as Mason struggled to cope with a drop\nin coupon demand.  While the board has formed a committee and started the\nprocess of looking for a new CEO, Leonsis said Groupon isn\u2019t\ngoing to make a rushed decision.  \u201cThe search is under way,\u201d he said on a conference call.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in a hurry. The leadership team is very strong and\nis gelling very nicely.\u201d  Lefkofsky and Leonsis have emphasized making Groupon more\ntransparent with more disclosures to investors, Child said. The\nco-CEOs have also narrowed the company\u2019s focus, he said.  \u201cYou are seeing us now focus on a smaller number of things\nthat will have impact in 2013,\u201d Child said.
