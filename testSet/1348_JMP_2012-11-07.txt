 "context": "The following article called 'Morgan Stanley Leads Slump as Elections, Europe Hit Banks' was published on 2012-11-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMorgan Stanley (MS)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  dropped the most in the last 12 months as Europe\u2019s debt crisis reignited and investors speculated that President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election means tighter curbs on banks.  The two securities firms led U.S. financial stocks lower after Obama defeated  Mitt Romney  and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the region\u2019s crisis is hurting Germany, its biggest economy. Goldman Sachs fell 6.6 percent to $117.98 at 4:15 p.m. in New York and Morgan Stanley tumbled 8.6 percent to $16.63.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  dropped 7.1 percent.  \u201cBankers were hoping Romney would win and give them more sympathetic regulators or that Republicans would take the Senate and they could rewrite Dodd-Frank,\u201d said Edward Mills, a bank policy analyst at FBR Capital Markets and former aide on the House Financial Services Committee. \u201cThe floodgate is going to open for the final rules under Dodd-Frank,\u201d he said, referring to the 2010 law designed to overhaul banking rules.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest U.S. lender by assets, fell 5.6 percent. That was the most in six months, since the day after disclosing a $2 billion trading loss in a London unit.  More \u2018Misery\u2019  Citigroup Inc. (C) , ranked third, declined 6.3 percent. It\u2019s based in New York along with JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. San Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the biggest U.S. home lender, fell 3.5 percent. Bank of America is ranked second by assets and based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Obama\u2019s win and the election of industry critics such as  Elizabeth Warren  to a Democrat-controlled Senate signal more \u201cmisery\u201d ahead for financial firms, according to  David Trone  of JMP Securities LLC.  Investors had bought shares in the five biggest U.S. banks amid hope that a Romney White House and a divided Senate would repeal some of the \u201cburdensome\u201d costs that Obama championed, Trone wrote to clients. These included bigger capital buffers, more compliance programs and less fee revenue, he wrote.  With the House still under Republican control, lawmakers and the Obama administration may \u201cfight brutally\u201d over a solution to the so-called fiscal cliff, and tax increases and spending cuts could trigger a U.S. recession, Trone wrote.  Romney Premium  Warren, a Harvard University professor, unseated Massachusetts Republican Senator  Scott Brown . She will serve with Republicans who previously made clear they would block any attempt by Obama to appoint her to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped establish over objections of bankers.  U.S. banks outperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 in six out of the last eight trading sessions leading up to Election Day, and closed near their highest levels for the year yesterday, said  Jason Goldberg , senior banking analyst at  Barclays Capital .  \u201cThe market was pricing in an increasingly higher chance that Romney would win,\u201d Goldberg said. Investors thought \u201cif Romney was elected, the path to  interest rates  would be higher and that would be good for banks,\u201d Goldberg said. Romney also would have been \u201ckinder\u201d in drafting new rules required by the Dodd-Frank overhaul, he said.  Bloomberg\u2019s Europe Banks and Financial Services Index, which tracks 38 companies in the region, dropped the most in almost three weeks, sliding 1.9 percent. Germany\u2019s 2013 growth forecast was cut to 0.8 percent from 1.7 percent amid a slowdown in the continent\u2019s economy, the European Commission said today.  \u201c Germany  has so far been largely insulated from some of the difficulties elsewhere in the euro area,\u201d Draghi said today at a Frankfurt conference. \u201cThe latest data suggest that these developments are now starting to affect the German economy.\u201d  \u2018Fierce\u2019 Advocate  Banks spent millions of dollars lobbying to block or dilute new rules that cut into their profit. With Obama\u2019s election, FBR\u2019s Mills said, \u201cthe industry has gone from a posture of trying to delay to now where they are going to be pushing for certainty.\u201d  Warren isn\u2019t the first pro-consumer lawmaker in Congress, \u201cbut no other consumer advocate has been able to capture the attention of the nation and take on  Wall Street  and win, and she\u2019s likely to sit on the Senate Banking Committee,\u201d Mills said. \u201cNot only do Democrats hold the Senate, they now have a fierce defender in the Senate to any potential change to Dodd- Frank.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Hugh Son in New York at   hson1@bloomberg.net ; Dawn Kopecki in New York at   dkopecki@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: David Scheer at   dscheer@bloomberg.net ; Rick Green at   rgreen18@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JMP Group Inc was 3.644664764404297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JMP Group Inc was ",
