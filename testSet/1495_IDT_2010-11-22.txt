 "context": "The following article called 'Booker Struggles With Newark Recovery as Zuckerberg, Robertson `Bet Big'' was published on 2010-11-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCory Booker  says his plan to fire\nhundreds of municipal workers, including 15 percent of the\npolice force, to help close the latest of a decade of budget\ndeficits is his toughest decision yet in five years as mayor of\nNewark, New Jersey.  \u201cThese are very difficult things,\u201d Booker, 41, an Oxford\nUniversity graduate who attended as a Rhodes Scholar, said\nduring a telephone interview from the back seat of his police-\ndriven sport-utility vehicle. \u201cThose are families that have\nbeen relying on city jobs. It\u2019s a very gut-wrenching, difficult\nprocess to go through.\u201d  The Democrat proposed eliminating the positions even as the\nstate\u2019s largest city, where more than half of residents are\nblack and a quarter live in poverty, had a 9 percent rise in\nshootings in 2010. Booker on Nov. 20 gave police until Nov. 30\nto vote on a proposal to avoid firings, according to Esmeralda\nCameron, his spokeswoman.  Since taking office in 2006, Booker has won $240 million in\ngrants from entrepreneurs and foundations, led by Facebook Inc.\nfounder  Mark Zuckerberg  and hedge-fund manager  Bill Ackman , by\npromoting the idea that the city of 280,000, located 15 miles\n(24 kilometers) west of Wall Street, is a mid-sized laboratory\nfor urban renewal. The mayor\u2019s need to balance his $600 million\nbudget just as Republican Governor  Chris Christie  is slashing\naid to cities such as Newark may limit the impact of the\ndonations he\u2019s attracted.  \u201cI don\u2019t see none of it being used,\u201d said Cynthia\nAndrews, whose son, Mujaheed E. Muhammad Williams, 28, was\nrobbed and killed Aug. 20 while walking to her home. \u201cWhy are\nlibraries closing? Why are our recreation centers closing?\u201d  Budget Gaps  Rising pension costs, a 23 percent drop in state aid from\n2009 and the longest U.S. recession since the 1930s combined to\novercome Booker\u2019s pledge to eliminate deficits by the end of his\nfirst term in July. He won re-election in a nonpartisan contest\nin May with 59 percent of the vote.  Faced with an $83 million gap this calendar year, Booker\ncut back hours at pools and libraries and raised property taxes\n16 percent. The city plans to fire hundreds of municipal workers\nto save money, and sell buildings to Essex County to raise cash.  Booker drew national attention to Newark after he appeared\non the  Oprah Winfrey  show in September to report a $100 million\ndonation from Zuckerberg to support teachers, increase\naccountability and promote charter schools.  Free Lunch  Newark\u2019s public schools, at their prime, educated Pulitzer\nPrize-winning author  Philip Roth  in the 1930s and 1940s,\naccording to the Philip Roth  Society  in New Britain,\nConnecticut. About 82 percent of the system\u2019s students now\nreceive free or reduced-price school lunches, said a  report \nreleased this month by the Association for Children of New\nJersey, a children\u2019s advocacy group.  Thirty-four percent of Newark\u2019s high-school freshmen in the\n2005-2006 school year dropped out before graduation,  data  from\nthe National Center for Education Statistics show. The rate\ncompares with 14 percent for the suburban New Jersey town of\nToms River, where the median household income is $71,032,\ncompared with the U.S. average of $52,175 and Newark\u2019s $35,601,\nCensus Bureau data  show .  Julian Robertson , founder of New York-based hedge fund\nTiger Management LLC, donated the maximum $26,000 allowed by New\nJersey campaign-finance laws to Booker\u2019s 2010 mayoral run and\nsaid he\u2019s \u201ca leader.\u201d  \u2018Big\u2019 Bet  \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to keep getting things done,\u201d\nRobertson, 78, said in an Oct. 4 interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m\nbetting on. I bet on it big.\u201d  Booker took office pledging to repair the finances of a\ncity that has yet to recover fully from six days of  race riots \nin 1967 that left 23 people dead and 725 injured.  The unrest sped up a process of migration that began in the\nyears after World War II, said Jason Barr, an associate\nprofessor of economics at Rutgers University\u2019s Newark campus.  \u201cThe deck was stacked, in some sense, against Newark, just\nin that there was a change in the U.S. economy,\u201d Barr said.\n\u201cPeople were moving out to the suburbs and manufacturing was\nleaving the Northeast. The riots made the situation much worse.\nAnd the lasting effect of the riots has been on Newark\u2019s name\nand perception.\u201d  The repair of Newark began under  Sharpe James , the city\u2019s\nmayor for 20 years, who was released from prison in April after\nserving 18 months for his 2008 conviction of illegally steering\ncity-owned property to a former mistress.  Devils\u2019 Home  Starting in 1986, James, a Democrat, helped revive the\ndowntown by luring a performing-arts center and minor-league\nbaseball stadium. Newark is home to companies such as  Prudential\nFinancial Inc.  and  IDT Corp.  The $365 million Prudential Center,\nhome of the New Jersey Devils hockey team, opened in 2007.  James, 74, declined to seek a sixth term in 2006, clearing\nthe way for Booker to win election.  Booker grew up in the northern New Jersey suburb of\nHarrington Park and moved to Newark in 1996. He graduated from\nStanford University, Oxford and Yale Law School.  The mayor made crime reduction his first-term focus as the\ncity was shaken by the 2007 execution-style shootings of four\ncollege students behind an elementary school.  Booker hired  Garry McCarthy , a 25-year veteran with the New\nYork Police Department and its chief crime strategist, to run\nhis police department. Using private money, Newark purchased\npolice cars, a gunshot-location system and closed-circuit\ntelevision cameras. Shootings fell 46 percent from 2006 to 2009.  \u2018New Strategies\u2019  This year, total crime  rose  3 percent through Oct. 31,\ncompared to the same period a year earlier. Murder has climbed\n16 percent, according to police department  statistics .  \u201cThe actual crime increase is small, and violent crime is\nstill down significantly since 2006,\u201d Booker said Nov. 13 by\ntext message. \u201cMany cities are up in murders, but we are\ncontinuing to bring new strategies, technologies and initiatives\nforward.\u201d  The city has lost about $120 million in funding from the\nstate and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in the past\ntwo years, and faces a $130 million jump in pension and health-\ncare costs next year, Booker said. Newark\u2019s unemployment  rate \nwas 14.7 percent in September, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics. Statewide, the  rate  was 9.4 percent.  Booker said on Nov. 10 that any cuts wouldn\u2019t affect the\nnumber of police on patrol, as officers would be shifted onto\nthe street. His budget plan included firing 167 police officers\nthat was scheduled for Nov. 12, until a state Superior Court\njudge granted the injunction blocking the move. The elimination\nof hundreds of non-uniformed jobs also is on hold, said Cameron,\nBooker\u2019s spokeswoman.  Less Overtime  At a Nov. 20 press conference, the mayor said the city\noffered a plan that included five furlough days and reduced\novertime instead of dismissals. Unions in negotiations also\noffered concessions including lower stress pay, clothing\nallowances and raises, according to the city.  The city will present a written proposal today and will\ndistribute it to the entire police force, which will vote on it\nNov. 30, Walter Melvin, a police-union representative, said in\nan interview.  \u201cFiring 167 officers is entirely avoidable,\u201d Booker said\nat the press conference. \u201cWe are open to holding off for a\ncouple days if they are willing to work with us.\u201d  Newark has recast itself since the riots as a home to\neducation and healthcare, with 18,643 jobs in local schools and\nuniversities. Rutgers University, the University of Medicine and\nDentistry state medical school and Essex County College have a\ncombined enrollment of 15,024 students at their city campuses.\nHealth care also accounts for 13,133 of more than 100,000 jobs\nin the city, according to the state Labor Department.  Winning Support  Booker said he is focusing on K-12 education this term. He\npledged to match Zuckerberg\u2019s $100 million, and said he raised\n$43 million so far. He\u2019ll need to convince citizens that he will\nspend the money to help them, said Newark native Steve Adubato\nJr., a Democratic political consultant.  \u201cAll politics is very local to Newarkers and they need to\nknow that you are one of them,\u201d Adubato said. \u201cThey need to\nfeel that you feel them and that you understand them.\u201d  \u201cCory has always been challenged in that regard,\u201d Adubato\nsaid. \u201cHe\u2019s not from those streets. Cory could bring in $500\nmillion and people will still question his commitment.\u201d  Booker said none of the  donated  money will help balance\nNewark\u2019s budget.  \u201cPeople are not giving to the general funds of cities,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThey\u2019re giving to specific projects.\u201d  Christie Aid Cut  Booker announced the grant almost three months after\nChristie cut aid by 5 percent for Newark\u2019s 39,000-student school\nsystem.  \u201cMy initial reaction was that it\u2019s a wonderful thing,\u201d\nKim Rivers, a stay-at-home mother of three whose autistic son\nattends Thirteenth Avenue Elementary School, said of the\ndonation. \u201cAt the same time I have to wonder if it was money\nthat\u2019s been the issue for Newark.\u201d  Newark spent $24,228 per child in the 2006-2007 year, more\nthan any other district in the U.S. with more than 15,000\nstudents, according to  data  from the National Center for\nEducation Statistics. The national average for those districts\nwas $9,323.  New Jersey, the second-wealthiest state by per-capita\nincome, under a state Supreme Court ruling gives extra money to\nthe 31 poorest school districts, including Newark, to bring them\nin line with spending levels of the richest.  Better Neighborhoods  The best way to fix schools is to improve their surrounding\nneighborhoods, said Alan Sadovnik, professor of Education,\nSociology and Public Administration and Affairs at Rutgers.\nPolicies should include economic development and job creation,\nthe improvement of health care and housing and the elimination\nof gangs, he said.  \u201cThe bottom line is that it\u2019s not all about money,\u201d said\nMaryam Bey, a former school board member.  Bey said she worries Booker is relying too much on\noutsiders to save the city, and hasn\u2019t focused enough on changes\non the ground.  \u201cPeople are starting to get on edge,\u201d Bey said. \u201cThey\ncan\u2019t pay their rent, they can\u2019t feed their families and they\ncan\u2019t pay their car notes. It\u2019s really hypocritical for the\nmayor to say he wants to save our children, and not want to help\ntheir parents.\u201d  The case is Fraternal Order of Police v. City of Newark, C-\n000237-10, Superior Court of New Jersey (Essex County).  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Terrence Dopp  in Trenton, New Jersey, at \n tdopp@bloomberg.net .
