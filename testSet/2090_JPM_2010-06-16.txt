 "context": "The following article called 'Spain Faces Higher Borrowing Costs at Auction as Deficit Concerns Deepen' was published on 2010-06-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSpain faces a jump in borrowing\ncosts at bond auctions today as growing investor concern the\ncountry may need external help to ease a credit crunch forces\nthe government to pay more to finance its budget deficit.  \n Spain plans to sell as much as 3.5 billion euros ($4.3\nbillion) of 10- and 30-year bonds, the Treasury said. The yield\non the country\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond rose to 4.939 percent,\nthe highest in almost eight years and 89 basis points more than\nthe 4.045 percent it paid at the last 10-year auction on May 20.  \n Spain is trying to convince investors it can cut the third-\nlargest  deficit  in the euro region, while propping up the\ncountry\u2019s savings banks and lifting the economy out of a two-\nyear slump. Spain, which faces 24.7 billion euros of maturing\ndebt in July, has seen the risk premium on its 10-year bonds\nrise to a decade high on concern it may need to tap a European\nUnion financial lifeline.  \n \u201cOne has to assume that a big enough concession has been\nmade for this auction to be taken down,\u201d said  Stuart Thomson ,\nwho helps manage the equivalent of $100 billion for Ignis Asset\nManagement in Glasgow. \u201cThere is considerable political risk\nwith Spain with the consolidation of the savings banks and the\nforthcoming budget still to be passed. Investors are right to be\nwary.\u201d  \n The auction comes as EU leaders meet in Brussels to advance\ntheir plan to establish a 750 billion-euro financial backstop to\nsupport high-deficit nations such as Spain and defend the euro.\nThe single currency has fallen 14 percent this year as Greece\u2019s\nnear-default fueled concern about rising debt in the region.  \n Credit Ratings  \n Fitch Ratings cut Spain to AA+ on May 28, citing concerns\nabout the economy\u2019s ability to grow. Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings\nServices ranks Spain AA while Moody\u2019s Investors Service has kept\nits top Aaa rating on the nation\u2019s credit.  \n The Spanish sale \u201cis a litmus test for the market,\u201d said\n Sean Maloney , a fixed-income strategist at Nomura International\nPlc in London. \u201cBut some cheapening in the lead-up is probably\na healthy development for the digestion. Spanish auctions\nthroughout the year have generally exceeded expectations.\u201d  \n Investor demand rose at Spain\u2019s most recent auction, a\nthree-year bond sale this month, snapping a year-long decline.\nThe  bid-to-cover ratio  was 2.1, meaning investors bid for 2.1\ntimes the amount of securities offered. That\u2019s more than the\nrange of 1.38 to 1.85 in the four previous auctions of similar\nmaturity debt. A 10-year auction on May 20 attracted bids for\n2.03 times the amount offered, compared with 1.55 times in\nMarch.  \n Yield Premium  \n The  extra yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year\nbonds rather than benchmark German bunds rose to a euro-era high\nof 222 basis points yesterday after a report in  El Economista \nsaid that the EU and the International Monetary Fund were\npreparing a 250 billion-euro credit line for Spain. The EU, the\nIMF and the Spanish government denied the report.  \n Concern is also mounting that Spain will need funds to pump\nliquidity into its banking system. Spanish lenders have been hit\nby a surge in bad loans stemming from the collapse of its real-\nestate market, and the Bank of Spain has had to seize two\nsavings banks. Short-term lending has dried up as confidence in\nthe banks wanes.  \n \u201cThe issue for Spain isn\u2019t sovereign paper, it\u2019s much more\nrelated to financial-sector stability,\u201d said  Harvinder Sian , a\nsenior bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in\nLondon.  \n Markets \u2018Closed\u2019  \n Francisco Gonzalez, chairman of Spain\u2019s second-largest\nbank,  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA , said on June 14 that\ninternational capital markets are \u201cclosed\u201d to most Spanish\ncompanies and banks. That has left Spanish lenders more\ndependent on financing from the European Central Bank. They\nborrowed 85.6 billion euros from the ECB last month, twice the\namount they needed when credit markets seized up in 2008 after\nthe collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., UniCredit SpA\nsaid in a note to investors yesterday.  \n Deputy Finance Minister  Carlos Ocana  acknowledged that\nSpanish borrowers need \u201cthe markets to open.\u201d Still, he said\nthe Treasury had \u201cno problem of any kind\u201d paying its debt,\nwhich is lower as a proportion of gross domestic product than in\nGermany or France.  \n Spain\u2019s debt amounted to 53 percent of GDP last year,\ncompared with a euro-region average of 79 percent. The July bond\nredemption of 16.2 billion euros is the last until April 2011,\nleaving 32 billion euros of maturing treasury bills spread out\nover the rest of the year.  \n \u201cThe July redemption is not a threat in my view,\u201d said\n Gianluca Salford , a fixed-income strategist at JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. in London.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Emma Ross-Thomas  in Madrid at \n erossthomas@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                                                 \n                     \n                     Enlarge image \n                     \n                     \n                       Fitch Ratings cut Spain to AA+ on May 28  \n                       \n                         \n                           Denis Doyle/Bloomberg \n                         \n                         The European Union flag, center, flies between Spanish national flags at the Bank of Spain in Madrid. \n                       \n                     \n                                        \n           \n                     The European Union flag, center, flies between Spanish national flags at the Bank of Spain in Madrid.
