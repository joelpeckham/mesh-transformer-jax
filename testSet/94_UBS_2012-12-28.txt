 "context": "The following article called 'Gilts Advance This Week on Fiscal-Cliff Concern; Pound Gains' was published on 2012-12-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.K. 10-year gilts rose this week,\nwith yields falling the most in a month, as speculation U.S.\nlawmakers will fail to reach agreement in time to avoid the so-\ncalled fiscal cliff boosted demand for safer assets.  Ten-year yields fell to the  lowest  in more than two weeks\ntoday as concern increased whether U.S. leaders will find a way\nto avoid the more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax\nincreases that will start in January. The pound strengthened\nagainst all its 16 major counterparts before U.K. reports next\nweek that economists say will show improvement in house prices,\nconsumer credit and mortgage lending.  \u201cThe rally in gilts in the past week can largely be\nattributed to concerns about the U.S. fiscal cliff,\u201d said\nAbhishek Singhania, a fixed-income strategist at Deutsche Bank\nAG in  London . \u201cPoor liquidity conditions have also had an\neffect.\u201d  The  10-year gilt  yield fell six basis points, or 0.06\npercentage point, this week to 1.82 percent at 5 p.m. London\ntime. The rate was little changed today after dropping as much\nas four basis points to 1.77 percent, the lowest since Dec. 11.\nThe 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 traded at 99.36.  U.S. congressional leaders plan to meet with President\n Barack Obama  today and House Republicans said they will convene\nDec. 30 as lawmakers seek to avoid the spending cuts and tax\ngains.  Annual Return  Gilts returned 3 percent this year through yesterday,\naccording to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European\nFederation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained\n4.4 percent and Treasuries earned 2.2 percent.  The pound strengthened 0.5 percent to 81.82 pence per euro\nafter gaining as much as 0.7 percent, the biggest increase since\nDec. 6. Sterling appreciated 0.4 percent to $1.6157.  Mortgage approvals rose to 54,000 last month from 52,982 in\nOctober, according to a median forecast of 15 analysts in a\nBloomberg News survey, before the data is released on Jan. 3.  Bank of England Deputy Governor Charlie Bean said last\nmonth the central bank\u2019s Funding for Lending program, which\nstarted in August, is showing a \u201cclear sign\u201d of feeding\nthrough to households.  The Nationwide Building Society will say U.K. home prices\nfell 0.9 percent in December from a year ago, less than\nNovember\u2019s 1.2 percent drop, according to a Bloomberg survey\nbefore the data is released next week. An index of construction\noutput climbed to 49.5 from 49.3, a separate survey showed ahead\nof the Jan. 3 report from Markit Economics.  \u201cWe see some signs of the U.K. economy stabilizing,\u201d said\n Geoffrey Yu , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London. \u201cWe\nexpect the pound to continue to outperform the euro next year.\u201d  The pound has appreciated 1.5 percent in 2012, according to\nBloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10\ndeveloped-market currencies. The euro declined 0.7 percent and\nthe dollar fell 2.8 percent.
