The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe euro rallied versus the dollar\nand yen for the first time in four days as speculation increased\nthe European Central Bank may signal tomorrow its willingness to\nstep up efforts to curb the spread of the region\u2019s debt crisis.  The shared currency reached the day\u2019s high after Reuters\nreported the U.S. would back increasing the size of the European\nUnion\u2019s rescue pool through the commitment of more money from\nthe International Monetary Fund. A U.S. official denied the\nreport. ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said yesterday in\nBrussels he didn\u2019t believe the region\u2019s financial stability was\nin question and signaled more bond purchases were possible.  \u201cThis is very beneficial for the euro,\u201d said  Jessica Hoversen , a Chicago-based analyst at the futures broker MF\nGlobal Holdings Ltd. \u201cThe selloff was broad in the euro, and\nyou have to anticipate the fact that the ECB is going to act.\u201d  The euro rose 1.2 percent to $1.3139 at 5 p.m. in New York,\nfrom $1.2983 yesterday, when it touched $1.2969, the lowest\nlevel since Sept. 15. It climbed as high as $1.3182. The\ncurrency dropped 6.9 percent in November, the biggest monthly\nloss since May.  The shared currency climbed 1.8 percent to 110.58 yen, from\n108.65 yesterday. The dollar appreciated 0.6 percent to 84.19\nyen, from 83.69.  Dollar Index Falls  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against\nsix trading partners including the euro and yen,  fell  for the\nfirst time in four days, even as the Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige\nBook business survey said the economy gained strength across\nmuch of the U.S. The index declined 0.6 percent to 80.685.  Stocks climbed after data showed manufacturing expanded in\nChina, the U.S. and Europe. The  MSCI World Index  gained 1.9\npercent and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index advanced 2.2\npercent. The Reuters-Jefferies  CRB Index  of raw materials surged\n2.5 percent.  South Africa\u2019s rand appreciated against most of the\ndollar\u2019s 16 major counterparts as commodities gained. It climbed\nas much as 1.4 percent to touch 7.0008 per greenback, the\nstrongest level in a week.  Other currencies tied to growth such as the Canadian and\nAustralian dollars strengthened as data showed Chinese\nmanufacturing expanded more than forecast. China\u2019s  Purchasing\nManagers\u2019 Index  climbed for a fourth month in November, reaching\n55.2 from 54.7 in October, according to a logistics federation\nreport. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was 54.8.  Canadian, Australian Dollars  The Canadian currency jumped 0.9 percent to C$1.0170 per\nU.S. dollar and the Aussie rose 1 percent to 96.81 U.S. cents.  Spanish 10-year government bonds rose, snapping an 11-day\ndecline and pushing yields down 22 basis points to 5.28 percent\non speculation the ECB may move to curb debt-crisis contagion.\nIt was the biggest drop on a closing basis since May. Portuguese\ntwo-year debt  rose , sending the yield as much as 24 basis points\nlower to 4.59 percent.  The ECB\u2019s Governing Council will meet tomorrow amid\nspeculation it will again delay its exit from emergency\nliquidity measures. Economists forecast policy makers will keep\nthe benchmark interest rate at 1 percent.  \u201cI don\u2019t believe that financial stability in the euro zone\ncould really be called into question,\u201d Trichet told lawmakers.\nThe ECB\u2019s bond program is \u201congoing\u201d and \u201cwe will see what we\ndecide.\u201d  Speculation the debt crisis will spread to Portugal and\nSpain grew after an 85 billion-euro ($112 billion) aid package\nled by European Union governments and the International Monetary\nFund was authorized on Nov. 28 for Ireland.  Bailout Fund  In May, European officials set up a 750 billion-euro\nbailout fund with IMF support after Greece\u2019s budget-deficit\nemergency. On the same day, the ECB took the unprecedented step\nof agreeing to buy government bonds to try to restore normal\nfunctioning on Europe\u2019s bond markets.  The euro briefly extended gains after Reuters reported,\nciting an unnamed U.S. official, a bailout-fund expansion would\nbe Europe\u2019s decision. A U.S. official in Washington told\nBloomberg the U.S. is not discussing extra IMF money for Europe.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a heightened degree of volatility,\npretty sharp intraday moves in both directions considering\nwhat\u2019s been going in Europe with the ECB,\u201d said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo & Co. in\nNew York.  The dollar is benefiting from Europe\u2019s woes, while the U.S.\neconomy is in a \u201cgradual state of repair\u201d and should avoid\nfalling back into recession, said  Richard Fisher , president of\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. He spoke to reporters today\nafter a speech in Killeen, Texas.  Bullish on Euro  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. forecast the euro will climb to\n$1.50 by the end of 2011.  \u201cDespite the improving U.S. growth picture, we continue to\nforecast a decline in the U.S. dollar on a broad basis, although\nwe have tempered the path of decline somewhat on the back of our\nincreased optimism on U.S. growth,\u201d Goldman economists led by\n Dominic Wilson  wrote in a report to clients today.  The dollar fell versus most major peers even as the\nInstitute for Supply Management\u2019s factory index showed U.S.\nmanufacturing expanded for a 16th straight month in November.  In U.S. central bank\u2019s Beige Book, five Fed banks said the\neconomy grew \u201cat a slight to modest\u201d rate, five others reported\na \u201csomewhat stronger pace\u201d and two said conditions were \u201cmixed.\u201d  European manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in four\nmonths in November. A factory gauge of the euro area rose to\n55.3 from 54.6 in October, London-based Markit Economics said.
