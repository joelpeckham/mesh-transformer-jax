The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe lira appreciated the most this\nmonth after the central bank tightened monetary policy by\nwithdrawing funding at its benchmark lending rate and the\n current-account gap  narrowed more than expected.  The Turkish currency strengthened 0.5 percent to 1.8052 per\ndollar at 4:02 p.m. in Istanbul, the most since March 28, paring\nthis week\u2019s losses to 0.6 percent. The yield on two-year\nbenchmark debt declined four basis points, or 0.04 percentage\npoint, to 9.44 percent.  The central bank withdrew lending in its one-week repo\nauction at 5.75 percent, the lower end of its rates corridor,\nfor the first time since March 29 after the lira sank to its\nlowest level in three weeks yesterday on concern the debt crisis\nin  Europe  is worsening and the influx of refugees escaping\nviolence in  Syria  increased.  \u201cThe central bank reacted to the weakness in the lira,\u201d\nDaniel Lenz, chief emerging-market strategist at DZ Bank AG, in\n Frankfurt , said in e-mailed comments. \u201cThe bank usually\ninstalls restrictive measures once dollar-lira moves sharply\nupward.\u201d  Turkey \u2019s current-account deficit narrowed more than\nexpected from a year earlier, signaling the central bank is\nmeeting its forecast of a \u201cgradual\u201d improvement in the gap.  The deficit stood at $4.2 billion in March, compared with\n$6 billion in the previous month, retreating for the fourth\nstraight month, the Ankara-based bank said on its  website  today.\nThe decline was greater than the $4.7-billion median estimate in\na Bloomberg survey of nine economists.

Central Bank governor Erdem Basci\nhalted lending at 5.75 percent in the week between March 22 and\nMarch 29.  \u201cI expect the bank will continue to refrain from lending\nat 5.75 percent until the Monetary Policy Committee meeting on\nApril 18 if the lira does not gain above 2.05 against the basket\nsuddenly,\u201d Murat Yardimci, head of trading at ING Bank AS, said\nin e-mailed comments.
