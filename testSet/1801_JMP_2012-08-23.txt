 "context": "The following article called 'Brocade Seen Delivering 32% Deal Gain After CEO Departure' was published on 2012-08-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrocade Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD) ,\nwhich has been trying to sell itself for more than two years, is\na step closer to unlocking a 32 percent gain for shareholders\nnow that its chief executive officer is on his way out.  The maker of computer switches for data-storage networks\nsaid last week that Michael Klayko will step down after more\nthan seven years as head of Brocade, which has disappointed\ninvestors as it struggled to integrate an Ethernet business it\nacquired in 2008. Brocade\u2019s stock fell this month to the lowest\nprice relative to free  cash flow  in three years, and yesterday\nthe shares were still cheaper than 90 percent of similar-sized\ncomputer-storage firms, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Even after working with  Frank Quattrone \u2019s Qatalyst Partners\nto find a buyer, Klayko failed to come to terms on a deal, and\nZK Research said the CEO\u2019s departure might help smooth\nnegotiations with suitors. Private-equity firms could be\nattracted to the cash flow generated by the $2.7 billion\ncompany\u2019s main storage business, according to Robert W. Baird &\nCo., while JMP Group Inc. said  Dell Inc. (DELL)  also may be among\nsuitors. Wunderlich Securities Inc. said Brocade could fetch\n$7.75 a share, 32 percent more than yesterday\u2019s closing price.  \u201cAt the end of the day, Mike probably wanted a role for\nhimself and a very high price, and on both those counts I\nsuspect that the hurdle has been lowered,\u201d Ben Nahum, a New\nYork-based fund manager for Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which\noversees $194 billion including 3.3 million Brocade shares, said\nin a telephone interview. \u201cPeople could tell you that it\u2019s been\nshopped and nobody wants it, but I don\u2019t buy that.\u201d  John Noh, a spokesman for Brocade, said he couldn\u2019t comment\nwhen asked about the prospects for a sale of the company.  Storage Networks  Founded in 1995, Brocade makes switches that connect\nservers to so-called storage-area networks. Its competitors\ninclude  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  and Juniper Networks Inc.  The company, which specializes in switches using a\ntechnology called Fibre Channel, acquired Foundry Networks Inc.\nfor $2.6 billion in December 2008 to enter the market for\nEthernet switches that are gaining popularity in data centers.\nAfter profit fell 57 percent last year, Brocade is  projected  to\nmore than triple net income in its fiscal year ending in\nOctober, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Brocade had been looking for potential buyers with\nQatalyst\u2019s assistance since 2009, a person familiar with the\nmatter said last year. During that time, Dell bought competitor\nForce10 Networks Inc.  Sally Palmer, a spokeswoman at San Francisco-based\nQatalyst, didn\u2019t return phone and e-mail messages seeking\ncomment on the firm\u2019s work with Brocade.  \u2018Not Them\u2019  \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting story,\u201d Tony Trzcinka, a Portsmouth,\nNew Hampshire-based fund manager at Pax World Management LLC,\nwhich oversees $2.6 billion including Brocade shares, said in a\nphone interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve been up for sale for three years and\nthere have been other purchases within this space, but still not\nthem. My hope is that somebody could unlock the value of the\nbusinesses.\u201d  In February,  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world\u2019s largest\nprivate-equity firm, ended talks to buy Brocade because the\nprice was too high for a leveraged buyout, a person with\nknowledge of the situation who declined to be identified because\nthe matter was private, said at the time.  Brocade announced last week that Klayko, who has worked at\nthe company for almost a decade in top sales and marketing\nroles, plans to resign and will stay on until a successor is\nidentified. His departure may revive takeover interest, said\nZeus Kerravala, an independent analyst for ZK Research in\nWestminster,  Massachusetts .  In Play  \u201cKlayko really thought they were the next big thing, and\nwhen they were not I don\u2019t think he was going to let that\ncompany go\u201d without demanding a high price, Kerravala said in a\nphone interview. \u201cHaving him leave brings them back into play\nas an acquisition target, and I certainly think there are\ncompanies out there that could use them.\u201d  Private-equity shoppers may be lured by the cash flow that\nBrocade\u2019s storage business generates, according to  Jayson Noland , a San Francisco-based analyst for Baird.  With a free-cash-flow yield of about 19 percent, Brocade\nproduces almost twice as much  cash  from its operations, after\ndeducting capital expenses, relative to its stock price than the\nmedian of computer-storage companies with more than $500 million\nin market value, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A private-equity firm could divest the Ethernet business,\nNoland said. To help pay down debt used to take Brocade private,\nit also could sell Brocade\u2019s headquarters and rent the space\nback through a sale-leaseback arrangement, he said.  Net Cash  \u201cThe storage side of Brocade generates a really high level\nof free cash,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThey own their\nown building in the Silicon Valley and it\u2019s a really nice\nbuilding. That\u2019s unlocked value right there, too.\u201d  Analysts also  project  that Brocade will end fiscal 2012\nwith more cash than debt on its balance sheet, according to\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company hasn\u2019t had a net\ncash position since 2008, before the acquisition of Foundry\nNetworks, the data show.  Brocade\u2019s  stock , which closed yesterday at $5.85, trades at\n5.3 times free cash flow, less than the median multiple of 9.6\ntimes for its peers, data compiled Bloomberg show.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very inexpensive stock, especially in terms of\ncash flow metrics,\u201d Matt Robison, a San Francisco-based analyst\nat Wunderlich, said in a phone interview. \u201cYou could have what\nyou would consider a very normal private-equity valuation with\nquite a change-of-control premium.\u201d  Today, Brocade shares gained 0.5 percent to $5.88.  Good Fit  The company\u2019s product line and market position could make\nit a good fit for companies such as Oracle or Hewlett-Packard,\nas well as non-U.S. suitors, said  Erik Suppiger , a San\nFrancisco-based analyst at JMP.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule out strategic buyers,\u201d Suppiger said in\na phone interview. \u201cThe footprint that Brocade has with its\nfiber capacities could be pretty attractive to players that are\ntrying to come into the U.S.\u201d  Deborah Hellinger , a spokeswoman for Oracle, wouldn\u2019t\ncomment on whether the  Redwood City , California-based company\nwas interested in Brocade. Michael Thacker, a spokesman for  Palo\nAlto , California-based Hewlett-Packard, also declined to comment\non the possibility of a Brocade takeover.  Still,  Joanna Makris , a New York-based analyst with Mizuho\nSecurities USA Inc. said Brocade may have lost its window of\nopportunity for finding a buyer after potential acquirers such\nas Dell chose other targets instead.  Different Signal  Even so, Brocade could be complementary to Dell after the\nForce10 acquisition, Wunderlich\u2019s Robison said.  David Frink , a spokesman for  Round Rock , Texas-based Dell,\nsaid the company doesn\u2019t comment on speculation about potential\nacquisition activity.  Bill Choi, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in  New\nYork , said Klayko\u2019s departure could signal that Brocade may be\nlooking to refocus its efforts on improving its existing\nbusiness under a new leader, rather than seek a sale.  \u201cTo me it shows a change in direction in the opposite\nway,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to sell the company and\nnow they\u2019re not. The shift is more toward execution now.\u201d  Elliott Management Corp., the hedge fund that pushed Novell\nInc. to sell itself in 2010, amassed a stake in Brocade a year\nago and is now the company\u2019s second-biggest shareholder.  The investor could persuade the company to be more flexible\nin price negotiations with a potential acquirer, Wunderlich\u2019s\nRobison said.  Peter Truell , a spokesman for New York-based\nElliott, said the company wouldn\u2019t comment on the investment.  The presence of the activist investor probably contributed\nto Klayko\u2019s departure, JMP\u2019s Suppiger said.  \u201cThe conventional wisdom is that his departure is a signal\nthat the auction is coming again,\u201d Robison said. \u201cThere are\nstill some potential buyers out there.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nWill Robinson in New York at \n wrobinson11@bloomberg.net ;\nTara Lachapelle in New York at \n tlachapelle@bloomberg.net .
