 "context": "The following article called 'Nigeria Braves Emerging-Debt Plunge With $1 Billion in Bonds' was published on 2013-07-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNigeria  returned to the international\n bond market  for the first time in two years with a $1 billion\nsale of Eurobonds, raising funds for power projects amid a\nselloff in emerging-market debt.  Africa \u2019s biggest oil producer issued $500 million of five-year notes to yield 5.375 percent and $500 million of 10-year\nsecurities at 6.625 percent yesterday, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. In January 2011, the nation paid 6.75\npercent on dollar debt due 2021 in its first overseas offering\nand the yield on the securities surged a record 133 basis points\nin June to 6.02 percent. Yields on emerging-market  bonds  jumped\n73 basis points to 5.80 percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co. data show.  Demand is waning after the  Federal Reserve  signaled in May\nand June plans to rein in $85 billion a month of assets\npurchases that drove borrowing costs to record lows and fueled\ndemand for emerging-market assets. Dollar debt sales this year\nby developing nations including Honduras and  Rwanda  have lost as\nmuch as 14 percent for investors.  \u201cWhile the pricing now may not be as attractive as it was,\nit\u2019s probably best they went into the market now before the\nFed\u2019s slowdown in bond buying actually begins later this year,\u201d\nYvonne Mhango, a sub-Saharan Africa economist at  Renaissance\nCapital  in Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed reply to questions.\n\u201cIt will only become more challenging for frontier markets to\ngarner interest from foreign investors and more expensive to\nraise foreign financing.\u201d  Oversubscribed Sale  Nigeria\u2019s sale was four times oversubscribed, Finance\nMinister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said yesterday on a conference\ncall. Investors in the U.S. accounted for 73 percent of the 10-year note purchases and U.K. buyers followed with 16 percent,\naccording to an e-mailed statement from Deutsche Bank AG, which\norganized the sale with Citigroup Inc.  \u201cIt was a bold move,\u201d Maryam Khosrowshahi, who runs\nsovereign debt origination for central and eastern  Europe , the\n Middle East  and Africa at Deutsche Bank, said in a phone\ninterview from  London  today. \u201cThe transaction went extremely\nwell, which demonstrates that there still is demand and\nliquidity.\u201d  Higher Yields  The extra yield investors demand over U.S. Treasuries to\nhold the 2021 Eurobonds of Nigeria, the continent\u2019s second-largest economy, has climbed to 377 basis points, or 3.77\npercentage points, from this year\u2019s low of 206 in January, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on two-year U.S. Treasuries touched 0.19 percent\nin May and that for notes included in the Bank of America\nMerrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Index reached 5.98 percent, both\nrecord lows. They have since risen to 0.34 percent and 6.94\npercent, respectively.  African countries from  Kenya  to Ghana and  Senegal  are\nlining up to borrow abroad as debt costs are still below the\naverage of the last five years.  \u201cThe market will continue to be supportive of  emerging\nmarkets  as emerging-market fundamentals in general remain\nstrong,\u201d Khosrowshahi said. The increase in yields \u201cdoesn\u2019t\nmean that issuers cannot raise financing anymore: the market is\nthere,\u201d she said.  Kenya, Ghana  Kenya said it\u2019s seeking a manager for its first foreign\nbond sale, targeting $1 billion for infrastructure development\nin  East Africa \u2019s largest economy. Ghana said it plans to offer\n$1 billion later this month in its second Eurobond sale, Senegal\nmay issue $500 million this year and Rwanda sold a debut $400\nmillion of international notes in April.  \u201cThe risk metrics in the Eurobond market have been more\nsupportive in recent days and the issuer probably wants to take\nadvantage of this relative turn,\u201d  Samir Gadio , a London-based\nemerging markets strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in\ne-mailed comments. \u201cNigeria will still pay a higher external\nfunding cost than what it could have secured a couple of months\nago pre-EM correction.\u201d  Yields on Nigeria\u2019s $500 million Eurobonds due January 2021\nrose 11 basis points, or 0.11 basis points, to 6 percent\nyesterday in London, where they are listed. They declined 14\nbasis points to 5.86 percent today.  \u201cNigeria is building a Eurobond yield curve by issuing new\nfive-year and 10-year notes, with outstanding issues now due in\n2018, 2021 and 2023,\u201d Gadio said.  \u2018Material Need\u2019  The government is raising funds to boost electricity output\nin a country where demand is almost double the supply of about\n4,000 megawatts and blackouts are a daily occurrence.  Nigeria needs $10 billion of infrastructure investment each\nyear to keep up with the needs of the country, home to more than\n170 million people, Okonjo-Iweala said in an interview in May.  \u201cThe fact that they decided to launch in the current\nmarket conditions suggests that there is material need for the\nfunds,\u201d  Alan Cameron , a London-based economist at FCMB Group\nPlc, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. \u201cAlthough the most\nrecent budget data is not yet available, we know that there was\na shortfall in projected federal government revenues of 19\npercent in the first quarter 2013, and there was likely a\nsimilar if not greater shortfall in quarter two.\u201d  \u2018Build Confidence\u2019  The government is in discussions with Nigeria\u2019s governors\non how to carry out future transfers and manage savings in the\nsovereign wealth fund, which now has $1 billion in assets,\nOkonjo-Iweala said on yesterday\u2019s conference call. The federal\ngovernment plans to step up contributions toward the end of the\nyear, she said.  The fund, started in October, was set up to invest savings\nmade from the difference between budgeted oil prices and actual\nmarket prices. The government is targeting $5 billion in savings\nin the fund in the \u201cmedium-term,\u201d the minister said.  \u201cWe have to build confidence that this money will be well\nmanaged and will be well invested,\u201d she said.  Crude production fell to 1.81 million barrels a day in\nMarch, the lowest since September 2009, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Oil theft in the Niger River delta caused\nproduction to decline to an average 2.2 million barrels a day in\nthe first quarter, according to figures released by state-owned\nNigerian National Petroleum Corp. on April 17.  This year\u2019s budget is based on a production forecast of\n2.53 million barrels a day.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard &\nPoor\u2019s all rate Nigeria three levels below investment grade.  Fitch said last month that slowing progress on government\nreforms before 2015 elections is keeping the country from\ngetting a better  credit rating , echoing Moody\u2019s, which said in\nMay that the country is also hindered by corruption, weak\ninstitutions and vulnerability to oil-price drops.
