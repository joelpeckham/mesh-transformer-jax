 "context": "The following article called 'Muddy Waters Retreats on Short Selling Chinese Stocks' was published on 2012-11-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCarson Block  says it\u2019s become too\ndifficult to short Chinese equities in the U.S. as bets on stock\ndeclines drop by 50 percent from a year ago.  Block, known for his allegations that Chinese companies\ntraded in North America engaged in accounting fraud, said in an\ninterview yesterday that he\u2019s lost interest in betting against\nthe stocks because the government helps protect them. Short\ninterest in the 83 biggest Chinese firms listed in New York has\ndropped to an average 2.61 percent of the total outstanding,\nfrom 5.22 percent a year ago, data compiled by Bloomberg and the\nU.K. researcher Markit show.  Short sellers, who sell securities they don\u2019t own to buy\nthem later at a lower price, are retreating as  China  limits\naccess to corporate filings and companies such as  Focus Media (FMCN) \nHolding Ltd. try to withdraw from the market through buyouts.\nThe  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese\nstocks in the U.S. has climbed 1.5 percent this year and Focus\nMedia, which Block\u2019s Muddy Waters LLC targeted last year, has\nreversed losses to gain 22 percent in 2012.  \u201cInvestors will be more comfortable knowing that the\nthreat of short seller attacks is a lot less than it used to be\nand a lot of companies have stepped up their corporate\ngovernance,\u201d Kevin Pollack, a managing director at Paragon\nCapital in New York, which invests in Chinese stocks, said by\nphone yesterday. \u201cThe fact a guy like Carson Block isn\u2019t\naggressively shorting companies hopefully will lead to more\ninvestor interest that otherwise would have been scared away.\u201d  Stocks Fall  The Bloomberg China-US index lost 1.4 percent yesterday to\n91.43, trimming its gain this year.  Pactera Technology\nInternational Ltd. (PACT) , a Chinese software-outsourcing provider,\nslipped 1.8 percent after Chief Executive Officer Tiak Koon Loh\nsaid sales will slow in 2013.  The Shanghai Composite Index of domestic stocks closed\nbelow 2,000 for the first time since 2009 yesterday, as the\nvalue of shares traded slumped to the lowest in four years. It\nfell 0.7 percent today as of the mid-day trading break.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese\nexchange-traded fund in the U.S., slipped 1.3 percent to $36.86\nin New York yesterday, as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index of\nU.S. equities dropped 0.5 percent.  Block, a 36-year-old lawyer, became the face of the short\nsellers against overseas-traded Chinese companies last year\nafter his report accusing Sino-Forest Corp. of overstating its\nplantation assets prompted the shares to slump 74 percent. Sino-\nForest, based in Hong Kong and Mississauga, Ontario, filed for\nbankruptcy protection in March, wiping out more than $3 billion\nin value.  New Oriental  Since Sino-Forest, Muddy Waters has focused on  New Oriental\nEducation & Technology Group Inc. (EDU)  and Focus Media. Their shares\nhave all rebounded after initial slumps when Block questioned\ntheir accounting. Both companies have denied any wrongdoing.   New Oriental, an education service provider based in\nBeijing, has risen 28 percent since July 17, the day before\nBlock said financial statements from the company\u2019s units were\nfraudulent and that its auditor would resign. Focus Media, a\nShanghai-based advertising company, has recouped 93 percent of\nits losses since Nov. 18, 2011, a day before Block claimed it\noverstated its ad network. The company has attracted a $3.5\nbillion takeover offer from a group of private-equity firms\nincluding  Carlyle Group LP. (CG) , which would be the largest leverage\nbuyout deal.  Short interest  on Focus Media has declined to 4.7 percent\nof total shares outstanding, from 81 percent a year ago,\naccording to Bloomberg and Markit data. The ratio for New\nOriental has fallen to 6.7 percent, from 12.8 percent in July,\nwhen Block started questioning the company\u2019s accounting.  \u2018Conceal Records\u2019  China began limiting access to corporate filings at the\n State Administration for Industry and Commerce  this year after\nshort sellers used them to highlight accounting discrepancies in\ncompanies listed abroad, lawyers including Nathan Bush, a\nBeijing-based partner at the law firm O\u2019Melveny & Myers LLP,\nsaid in interviews in June.  \u201cChina has gotten harder in the sense that the government\nhas really taken the side of the fraud,\u201d Block said in an\ninterview on with  Stephanie Ruhle  and  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg\nTelevision\u2019s \u201cMarket Makers.\u201d \u201cThe government is working with\na number of these companies to try to conceal records that are\npublic. When you are up against that sort of strength of the\nability to revise history, it becomes difficult. That is one of\nthe reasons we\u2019re not that interested in China anymore.\u201d  Olam International  The  State Administration for Industry and Commerce , which\ncompiles corporate records in China, didn\u2019t immediately respond\nto faxed questions seeking comment today. An official at China\u2019s\nconsulate in New York, who asked not to be identified because\nit\u2019s against their policy, said that she\u2019s not in a position to\nrespond to Block\u2019s comments.  In a sign that he\u2019s moving on from targeting the Chinese\ncompanies, Block is attacking Singapore-listed  Olam\nInternational Ltd. (OLAM) , saying in a 133-page report published\nyesterday that the commodities trader runs a high risk of\nfailure. Olam, the world\u2019s second-largest rice trader, is the\nfirst non-Chinese company Block has said he is betting against.  Olam is suing Muddy Waters and Block for defamation as the\nstock has slumped more than 10 percent in  Singapore  since the\nshort seller\u2019s first allegations against the company on Nov. 19.  Block\u2019s allegations over the past two years have increased\ninvestor scrutiny of Chinese companies trading on North American\nstock exchanges, especially so-called reverse mergers, a process\nthat involves buying a publicly traded shell company. The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission has said reverse mergers may\nbe prone to \u201cfraud and other abuses.\u201d  Reverse Mergers  The  Bloomberg Chinese Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks\nthe 81 Chinese companies that gained U.S. listings after buying\nfirms that already trade, has tumbled 68 percent since the end\nof 2009. Companies including China MediaExpress Holdings Inc.,\nan advertising company listed through a reverse merger, have\nbeen delisted after Block exposed financial irregularities.  \u201cCarson\u2019s really is a victim of his own success here,\u201d\nEric Jackson, managing partner of Naples, Florida-based Ironfire\nCapital LLC, said by phone. \u201cHis greatest successes in shorting\nChinese stocks were these very small reverse-listed companies,\nand, partly because he\u2019s done such a great job of pulling back\nthe curtain, those companies are by and large gone now.\u201d  Delisting Shares  With short sellers pushing down valuations, a growing\nnumber of Chinese companies are seeking to exit U.S. exchanges.\nSince April 2010, 49 companies -- including Focus Media and  7\nDays Group Holdings Ltd. (SVN)  -- have announced their intention to go\nprivate and delist from U.S. markets, according to a report by\nRoth Capital Partners issued Nov. 5.  China Development Bank Corp., the state-owned lender, is\nproviding more than $1 billion to assist companies, including\nmeat producer  Zhongpin Inc. (HOGS)  and  Fushi Copperweld Inc. (FSIN) , a\nmanufacturer of steel wire, to leave the U.S. market.  \u201cBecause of Muddy Waters and other short sellers, there\nhas been a cleansing period and companies have stepped up,\u201d\nsaid Paragon\u2019s Pollack. \u201cThere are just fewer bad apples that\nare easily identifiable.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nYe Xie in New York at \n yxie6@bloomberg.net ;\nVictoria Stilwell in New York at \n vstilwell1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nEmma O\u2019Brien at \n eobrien6@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of New Oriental Education & Technology Group, Inc. was 1.8002125024795532 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of New Oriental Education & Technology Group, Inc. was ",
