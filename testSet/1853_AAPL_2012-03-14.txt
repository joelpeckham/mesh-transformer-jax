 "context": "The following article called 'AU Optronics, Two Executives Convicted of Panel Price Fixing' was published on 2012-03-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAU Optronics Corp. (2409) , Taiwan\u2019s\nsecond-largest maker of display panels for computers and\ntelevisions, its vice chairman and a senior vice president were\n convicted  of colluding with rivals to fix prices.  A federal jury in  San Francisco  found two other company\nofficials not guilty yesterday and couldn\u2019t reach a unanimous\ndecision on a fifth executive charged in a U.S. investigation of\nprice-fixing among makers of electronic components used in\ntelevisions, laptop computers and mobile phones. The company\nfaces a fine of as much as $1 billion, the  Justice Department \nsaid yesterday.  Executives of Hsinchu, Taiwan-based AUO secretly met with\ncounterparts at other panel makers in hotel rooms, karaoke bars\nand tea rooms around Taiwan at so-called crystal meetings from\n2001 to 2006 to set prices as an oversupply was pushing prices\ndown 40 percent, federal prosecutors told jurors during the\neight-week trial.  AUO is the only LCD maker charged with price-fixing by the\nU.S. to take its case to trial. Since 2008, rivals including  LG\nDisplay Co. (034220) ,  Chunghwa Picture Tubes (2475) ,  Chi Mei Optoelectronics\nCorp. (3009)  and  Sharp Corp. (6753)  agreed to plead guilty and pay more than\n$890 million in fines. Seventeen executives have been charged\nand 10 have pleaded guilty and have been sentenced to prison,\nthe Justice Department said in a statement yesterday.  Company Will Appeal  AUO said it will appeal the verdict and a fine that it\nexpects to be issued within the next few months. The evidence\npresented by prosecutors at trial was \u201cdistorted and\nincomplete,\u201d it said in a statement.  \u201cThe company presented undisputed evidence that it\nconsistently priced below the so-called crystal prices from 2001\nto 2006, which the company believes to be solid evidence that it\ndid not participate in any price fixing agreement,\u201d according\nto the statement.  The convicted executives face fines as high as $1 million\nand as long as 10 years in prison. Relatives of the executives,\nwho are all  Taiwan  residents, wept in the courtroom after the\nverdicts were read.  AUO shares dropped as much as 2.5 percent in Taipei trading\ntoday, the biggest intraday decline since March 2. The stock was\ndown 1.3 percent at NT$15.65 as of 10:29 a.m. local time.  U.S. Statute  \u201cThe magnitude of the possible fine, $1 billion, may shock\na lot of people. AUO has only provisioned for about one third of\nthat,\u201d said Jamie Yeh, who rates the stock underweight at\nBarclays Bank Plc in Taipei. \u201cThe fact that they lost the case\nwas expected\u201d and may account for the share\u2019s decline being\nless than the daily limit.  \u201cAt every step, our lawyers and accountants have discussed\nthe appropriate provisions,\u201d AUO Chief Financial Officer Andy\nYang said today. He declined to say how much has already been\nprovisioned or whether that figure will increase after\nyesterday\u2019s verdict.  \u201cThis case is just beginning,\u201d company attorney Dennis\nRiordan said in an interview after the verdict. \u201cThe most\nimportant question it raises, which the jury didn\u2019t get, is does\nthe Sherman Act apply to conduct that takes place on foreign\nsoil?\u201d  Whether the act, a U.S. statute outlawing conduct that\nstymies competition, can be used against companies and people\nfor actions outside the country has never been decided by a U.S.\ncourt and will be the focus of AUO\u2019s appeal, Riordan said.  $500 Million Gain  The defendants will first seek a new trial and acquittal. A\nsentencing date will be set after U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, who presided over the trial, rules on those questions,\nRiordan said.  H.B. Chen, former president and now vice chairman of AUO,\nwas found guilty along with Hui Hsiung, who was executive vice\npresident during the alleged conspiracy. The jury also said the\namount of gain from all companies participating in the price-\nfixing conspiracy was more than $500 million.  L.J. Chen, a former director of the company\u2019s desktop\ndisplay group who is now president of solar business operations,\nand Hubert Lee, a senior manager for the group, were found not\nguilty. Illston declared a mistrial on the fifth company\nexecutive,  Steven Leung , who was also a senior manager of the\ngroup. Riordan said all five executives still work for the\ncompany.  \u2018Less Culpability\u2019  \u201cThe jury finding $500 million in ill-gotten gains by\nmembers of the cartel demonstrates the harmful effect of this\nprice-fixing conspiracy on American businesses and consumers,\u201d\nActing Assistant Attorney General Sharis Pozen said in a\nstatement yesterday.  Some jurors argued there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to show\nthat Leung willingly participated in the conspiracy and it\nappeared he was being directed by his managers, said one juror,\na former  AT&T Inc. (T)  employee who wouldn\u2019t give her name. The jury\nvoted 8-4 to convict Leung, the juror said in an interview.  L.J. Chen and Lee had \u201cless culpability\u201d than their\nsuperiors, she said. The guilty verdicts for the company were\nbased in part on evidence of what AU Optronics did with the\ninformation it got from meeting with competitors, the juror\nsaid.  Average Overcharges  The monthly crystal meetings corrupted competition and\ndirectly affected purchasers such as  Dell Inc. (DELL) ,  Hewlett-Packard\nCo. (HPQ)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , prosecutors told the jury during the trial.  Average overcharges during the conspiracy amounted to about\n$53 a panel,  Michael Scott , a Justice Department attorney, told\nthe jury.  \u201cThey stole money from consumers and caused serious\nharm,\u201d Scott said in closing arguments on Feb. 28.  Government witnesses included Chunghwa and Chi Mei\nexecutives who had pleaded guilty and received prison sentences\nin the U.S. They testified that AUO executives attended the\nmeetings, Scott said.  Lawyers for the company said it never agreed to fix prices\nand attended the meetings to gauge market conditions and monitor\ncompetitors, neither of which is illegal.  Product prices plunged during the alleged conspiracy, with\n15-inch panel prices falling to $125 from $200 and 19-inch panel\nprices dropping to $195 from $405, said  John Cline , a company\nattorney.  \u2018Bought and Sold\u2019  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound to me like stealing,\u201d Cline said\nduring closing arguments. \u201cIf they agreed to fix prices, why\nwould prices not go up?\u201d  Government witnesses were \u201cbought and sold\u201d with lenient\nsentences in exchange for their cooperation and testimony, said\nChristopher Nedeau, another lawyer for the company. The\nwitnesses couldn\u2019t remember details about what was said at the\nmeetings or who said what, Nedeau told jurors.  The witnesses also testified that participants in the\nmeetings lied about pricing and tried to bluff their\ncompetitors, he said.  \u201cCrystal meetings were an easy way to keep an eye on\ncompetition,\u201d Nedeau said.  AUO also faces civil lawsuits in federal court in San\nFrancisco by purchasers of LCD panels.  Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481)  is Taiwan\u2019s largest maker of liquid\ncrystal displays.  The case is U.S. v. Lin, 3:09-cr-00110, U.S. District\nCourt, Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).
