The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSouth Korea\u2019s economy grew the\nleast in two years in the fourth quarter as exports sank\nbecause of  Europe \u2019s sovereign debt crisis and a faltering\nglobal expansion.

South\nKorea\u2019s economy is likely to shrink this quarter and the\ncentral bank may cut borrowing costs in April and July,\nNomura Holdings Inc. says.  \u201cThere won\u2019t be much choice for the  Bank of Korea  other\nthan to cut rates\u201d if the export slump worsens and first-\nquarter economic growth deteriorates, said Park Sang Hyun\nchief economist at Seoul-based HI Investment & Securities Co.

In Europe today, a report may show unemployment rates\nrising in Scandinavia. Sweden\u2019s jobless rate is estimated to\nincrease to 7 percent in December from 6.7 percent a month\nearlier, while  Denmark \u2019s rate may advance to 6.3 percent from\n6.2 percent, according to the median forecasts in surveys of\neconomists.

South Korea\u2019s  inflation  has remained elevated in part\nbecause a weakening won has made imported goods more\nexpensive. Consumer prices rose 4.2 percent from a year\nearlier in November and December, exceeding the central\nbank\u2019s target limit of 4 percent.
