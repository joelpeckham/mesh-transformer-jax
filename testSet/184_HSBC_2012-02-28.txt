 "context": "The following article called 'Sugar May Tumble Below 20 Cents on Surplus, F.O. Licht Says' was published on 2012-02-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRaw sugar may drop to less than 20\ncents a pound by year-end as global supply exceeds demand for a\nsecond season in 2012-2013, according to F.O. Licht GmbH, which\nsaid that lower prices may spur restocking by importers. The\ncommodity dropped for the first time in nine days in  New York .  The surplus may counter support that sugar gets from higher\noil prices, according to Christoph Berg, managing director at\nthe Ratzeburg, Germany-based researcher who\u2019s covered the market\nsince 1994. Sugar, which hasn\u2019t traded below 20 cents since\nSeptember 2010, snapped the best run since November of that year.  Lower prices would cut expenses for users such as soft-\ndrinks maker  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , which has also predicted global\nsurpluses, while helping to extend a decline in  world food costs .\nSugar may trade between 20 cents and 25 cents on rising supply\nin the Northern Hemisphere and prospects for a good 2012-2013\ncrop in  Brazil , HSBC Holdings Plc said in a report on Feb. 17.  \u201cWe currently see a fair price, possibly some weakness in\nthe second half,\u201d Berg said in a phone interview before an\nindustry conference that began in Bangkok today. \u201cWe\u2019re talking\nmore about sugar prices falling to 20 cents, possibly below.\u201d  Raw sugar on ICE Futures U.S. lost 27 percent in 2011, the\nbiggest drop in a decade, as traders sold the commodity on\nanticipation of a second surplus after three shortages. The May-\ndelivery contract declined as much as 0.7 percent to 25.36 cents\ntoday, dropping from the highest level in more than three months.\nThe price was at 25.50 cents at 9:43 a.m. in  London .  Olam\u2019s Outlook  Supply may top demand by as much as 7 million tons in 2012-\n2013 as Brazil\u2019s crop recovers and output in Thailand and China\nclimbs, John Stansfield, senior analyst at  Olam International\nLtd. (OLAM) \u2019s UK unit, said at the conference and in an interview. This\nseason\u2019s surplus is estimated at 9 million tons, he said today.  \u201cHaving surpluses for two consecutive years puts pressure\non prices,\u201d said Stansfield, who\u2019s worked in the industry since\n1994. The level of 20 cents would offer strong potential support,\nand lower prices would increase consumption, he said.  The surplus may be smaller than the 5.8 million tons this\nseason,  Stefan Uhlenbrock , senior commodity analyst at F.O.\nLicht, said in an interview. The company is compiling data on\nthe 2012-2013 balance, and declined to provide precise estimates.  While a rally in oil may help to lift sugar in the near\nterm, the surplus will contain any rise, F.O Licht\u2019s Berg said.\nHigher crude  oil prices  can trigger increased production of\nethanol from cane, curbing the production of raw sugar.  Crude oil in New York has gained 9.8 percent this year on\nprospects for higher demand as the global economy recovers, and\non concern that supplies from  Iran  may be disrupted. The April-\ndelivery contract was little changed at $108.51 a barrel.  Brazilian Crop  Output in the biggest sugar producer Brazil may gain next\nseason on weather conditions and a recovery in cane yields,\nUhlenbrock said. The harvest in number-two grower  India  is\nheaded for a downturn as millers may be unable to make cane\npayments to farmers for this year\u2019s crop, he said.  Demand growth this season may recover to a normal rate of\n2.4 percent after three years of stagnant growth as prices have\ndeclined to affordable levels, said Uhlenbrock. That will spur\ndemand, especially from China, Pakistan and  Africa , he said.  Thailand , the second-largest exporter, is among countries\nforecasting higher output. The cane crop may be a record this\nseason and reach a fresh peak next year as plantings expand, the\nOffice of the Cane & Sugar Board said yesterday. Exports may be\n7.9 million tons in calendar 2012, Secretary-General Prasert Tapaneeyangkul said. That\u2019s 18 percent more than last year.  Global food costs have declined 9.9 percent since reaching\nan all-time high in February 2011, according to a 55-item gauge\ncompiled by the Food & Agriculture Agency, the Rome-based United\nNations group.  The sugar market is set for a \u201cbig surplus and lower\nprices,\u201d Jacob Robbins, managing director of global sweeteners\nat Coca-Cola, said earlier this month. The Atlanta-based company\nis the world\u2019s largest maker of soft drinks.
