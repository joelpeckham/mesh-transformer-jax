The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrazilian prosecutors are seeking\nfor a second time to ban  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  from\noperating in the country after a 3,000-barrel  oil spill .  The two companies must be suspended from operating until\nthey stop environmental damage from the November leak off the\ncoast of Rio de Janeiro, Prosecutor Gisele Porto said in a March\n26 appeal filing obtained by Bloomberg News. The two companies\nshould be fined 500 million reais ($273 million) a day if they\ndon\u2019t comply with the suspension, according to Porto.  Chevron is facing mounting attacks from Brazilian\npoliticians, prosecutors and regulators after the leak at its\n$3.6 billion Frade project in November and a second seep in\nMarch. Federal prosecutor Eduardo Santos, who\u2019s probing the\nslick independently from the regulator, charged 17 executives at\nChevron and Transocean with environmental crimes and called for\nprison sentences of as much as 31 years.  Chevron took out full-page advertisements in several\nBrazilian newspapers March 29 to say the Frade leak hasn\u2019t\ncaused environmental damage. The company said the criminal\ncharges against its executives are unfounded.  Porto\u2019s appeal comes after a federal judge in February\nrejected a request from prosecutor Santos, who is based in the\ncity of Campos dos Goytacazes, to halt Chevron and Transocean\noperations after the spill. Federacao Unica dos Petroleiros,\n Brazil \u2019s main oil union, filed a separate case last week to halt\nChevron and Transocean\u2019s work in Brazil.  Chevron responded to the spill in accordance with industry\nstandards and the development plan approved by the country\u2019s oil\nregulator,  Kurt Glaubitz , a spokesman for the  San Ramon ,\nCalifornia-based company, said by e-mail March 30. There\u2019s been\nno impact to marine life and no oil reached the coast, he said.  Chevron reported new seeps this month of about a barrel of\noil at the Frade project off Brazil\u2019s coast. The company has\nhalted production as a precautionary measure.
