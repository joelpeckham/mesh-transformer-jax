 "context": "The following article called 'Treasury Yield Is Six Basis Points From Low Before GDP' was published on 2012-07-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTreasury yields were six basis\npoints from a record low before a government report that\neconomists said will show growth in U.S. gross domestic product\nslowed and inflation cooled.  Yields indicate investors are cutting bets on inflation as\nthe expansion slows. The five-year, five-year forward  break-even\nrate , a measure of expectations for prices that the  Federal\nReserve  uses to guide monetary policy, fell to 2.39 percentage\npoints on July 24, the least in four months and below the\naverage of 2.75 for the past decade. Today\u2019s GDP report may\nsignal \u201cdanger\u201d for the economy, said  Tony Crescenzi  at\nPacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world\u2019s\nbiggest bond fund.  \u201cTreasury bond yields will decline further,\u201d said\nHiromasa Nakamura, who invests in Treasuries in  Tokyo  at Mizuho\nAsset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $42\nbillion and is part of Japan\u2019s third-biggest bank. \u201cThe economy\nis very fragile. Inflation is subdued.\u201d  The benchmark 10-year  yield  was little changed at 1.44\npercent at 10:07 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond\nTrader data. The all-time low was 1.379 percent set July 25. The\n1.75 percent note due in May 2022 traded at 102 25/32.  Nakamura said he favored longer maturities, those that will\nrally most if yields fall. He switched his forecast for 10-year\nyields at year-end to 1 percent from 1.2 percent.  U.S. Growth  U.S. GDP growth slowed to a 1.4 percent annual rate in the\nsecond quarter, from 1.9 percent in the previous three months,\naccording to a Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce\nDepartment reports the figure today.  A measure of inflation that is tied to  consumer spending \nand strips out food and energy costs, climbed at a 1.8 percent\nannual pace, compared with 2.3 percent in the previous quarter,\na separate survey showed. Fed officials have defined their\ninflation target as 2 percent a year.  Treasuries have returned 1.4 percent this month as of\nyesterday, according the Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes,\nreflecting demand for  U.S. debt  as a haven from slowing growth\nand surging yields in Europe amid the financial turmoil. For\n2012, U.S. government securities have gained 3.1 percent, versus\n5.3 percent for the MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks.  Draghi\u2019s Pledge  Treasuries fell yesterday after European Central Bank\nPresident  Mario Draghi  said the ECB will defend the euro,\ndamping demand for the safest assets.  \u201cWithin our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it\ntakes to preserve the euro,\u201d Draghi said during a speech in\nLondon. \u201cAnd believe me, it will be enough.\u201d  Yields on Spanish bonds have dropped after rising to euro-\nera records earlier in the week.  \u201cDraghi comments have the potential to be a game\nchanger,\u201d said  Peter Jolly , head of market research at  National\nAustralia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  in Sydney. \u201cOur sense is that yields are\nprobably not justified at these levels.\u201d Ten-year rates will\nclimb to 2 percent by Dec. 31, he said.  The U.S. central bank plans to sell as much as $8 billion\nof Treasuries due from May to September 2015 today, according to\nthe Fed Bank of New York  website . The sales are part of its\neffort to swap short-term Treasuries in its holdings for those\nwith longer maturities, supporting the economy by putting\ndownward pressure on long-term borrowing costs.  \u2018Stall Speed\u2019  \u201cMost investors judge that it is going to be hard for the\nFed to keep U.S. rates down forever and any good news from here\ncould lead to a reversal,\u201d  George Goncalves , head of rates\nresearch at Nomura Securities International Inc., wrote in a\nreport yesterday. The company is one of the 21 primary dealers\nthat trade directly with the Fed.  Floating-rate notes offer investors protection in case\ninflation quickens and the Fed raises  interest rates  in the\nyears ahead, said Meg McClellan, the U.S. head of fixed income\nat JPMorgan Private Bank in New York.  \u201cIf you do buy five-, six-year maturity floating-rate debt\nand the Fed does have to move because of inflation, you\u2019re going\nto get some upside from a pickup in coupon,\u201d she said yesterday\non Bloomberg Television\u2019s  \u201cMarket Makers\u201d with  Stephanie Ruhle  and Scarlet Fu.  The 1.4 percent gain projected for today\u2019s GDP report may\nspell trouble for the  U.S. economy , said Pimco\u2019s Crescenzi, who\nis based in  Newport Beach ,  California .  \u201cReadings below 1.5 percent are in danger territory\nbecause they suggest stall speed,\u201d Crescenzi told Susan Li on\nBloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cFirst Up.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nWes Goodman in Singapore at \n wgoodman@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDaniel Tilles at \n dtilles@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 27.625110626220703 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
