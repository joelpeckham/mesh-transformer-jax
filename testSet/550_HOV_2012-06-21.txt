 "context": "The following article called 'Sales of Previously Owned U.S. Homes Probably Declined in May' was published on 2012-06-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSales of previously owned U.S. homes\nprobably fell in May, showing an uneven recovery in residential\nreal estate, economists said a report may show today.  Purchases dropped 1.1 percent to a 4.57 million  annual rate \nlast month, according to the median forecast of 74 economists\nsurveyed by Bloomberg News. Jobless claims last week were little\nchanged, other data may show.  The weakest  employment  gain in a year last month along with\nlimited access to credit are restraints on an industry that\u2019s\nbeen supported by record-low borrowing costs and a drop home\nvalues. The figures underscore Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.\nBernanke \u2019s comments that the economy is failing to get a boost\nfrom a more typical real-estate recovery.  \u201cThe housing market is recovering very slowly,\u201d said\nYelena Shulyatyeva, U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York.\n\u201cI do see a pickup in demand throughout the year but it\u2019s going\nto be very gradual. What we need to see probably is continued\nlow  mortgage rates . That will gradually continue to improve\nhousing demand.\u201d  The report from the National Association of Realtors is due\nat 10 a.m. in Washington. Bloomberg survey estimates ranged from\n4.4 million to 4.73 million.  Existing-home sales, which are tabulated when a contract\ncloses, have climbed since reaching a low of 3.39 million at an\nannual rate in July 2010. In the buildup to the subprime lending\ncollapse and recession, purchases reached a peak of 7.25 million\nin September 2005.  Labor Market  Limited job growth may be weighing on housing. Employers\nadded 69,000 positions in May, the fewest in 12 months,\naccording to Labor Department figures. The jobless rate climbed\nto 8.2 percent from April\u2019s 8.1 percent.  First-time applications for  unemployment benefits  fell to\n383,000 last week from 386,000 in the prior period, according to\nthe Bloomberg survey median before Labor Department figures at\n8:30 a.m. Jobless claims are close to a high this year of\n392,000, reached in April.  Home prices  have shown few signs of strengthening as\nforeclosures put more properties on the market. Foreclosure\nstarts grew in May for the first time since January 2010, after\nthe largest U.S. loan servicers settled with states over faulty\ndocumentation, according to a report last week from RealtyTrac\nInc., a real estate data provider in  Irvine ,  California .  \u201cBe careful of the signals that you\u2019re translating into\nrecovery because they\u2019re not very strong,\u201d said Michael Feder,\nchief executive officer of Radar Logic Inc. in  New York , which\ntracks home prices. \u201cSome of the signs of an early spring\nrecovery were actually the result of a mild winter in some\nmarkets and some investor buying.\u201d  Housing Affordability  Cheaper properties and lower mortgage rates pushed up\nhomebuyer affordability to a record in the first quarter,\naccording to the NAR. The average rate on a 30-year fixed\nmortgage dropped to a  record-low  3.67 percent in the first week\nof June, according to figures from  Freddie Mac .  New Jersey-based builder  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV)  is\namong companies that are more upbeat. The company reported a 52\npercent increase in contracts in the second quarter compared\nwith last year.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a head fake this year, it feels like\nit\u2019s beginning of a recovery, so we\u2019re very encouraged with what\nwe\u2019ve been seeing,\u201d said  Larry Sorsby , chief financial officer,\nsaid at a June 13 conference.  The Standard & Poor\u2019s Supercomposite Homebuilding Index has\nadvanced 34 percent since the end of last year, more than the\n7.8 percent gain in the broader  S&P 500 .  \u201cThere are some good signs in housing, but nevertheless we\nare not getting the size of the boost, the amount of help in the\nrecovery we would normally get from a housing recovery,\u201d\nBernanke said yesterday at a press conference in Washington\nafter the Fed announced it would extend a program aimed at\nbolstering the economy.  \u201cAccess to credit is a major issue\u201d for some Americans\nwanting to buy a home, Bernanke said. \u201cMortgage access is much\ntighter than it has been for a long time. What that does, to\nsome extent, is it mutes the impact of the Fed\u2019s actions.\u201d  \nTo contact the reporter on this story:\nLorraine Woellert in  Washington  at \n lwoellert@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChristopher Wellisz at   cwellisz@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. was 66.25 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. was ",
