 "context": "The following article called 'AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Novartis Among Suitors for Onyx' was published on 2013-07-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , Pfizer Inc. and\n Novartis AG (NOVN)  are among the suitors preparing bids for  Onyx\nPharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX) , the drugmaker that snubbed an unsolicited\noffer from  Amgen (AMGN)  Inc., said two people familiar with the matter.  The companies, which signed confidentiality agreements and\nhired advisers, may make first-round bids this week, according\nto the people, who asked not to be named because the process is\nprivate. Onyx disclosed last month that it\u2019s working with\nadvisers on finding bidders following its rejection of Amgen\u2019s\nbid of $120 a share.  Amgen is still interested and is doing due diligence, said\nthree people with knowledge of the process. Shares of South San\nFrancisco, California-based Onyx have consistently traded at\nmore than that price since the proposal from  Thousand Oaks ,\nCalifornia-based Amgen surfaced in June, indicating the\nsuccessful suitor may have to beat that offer by a wide margin.  Onyx  rose  2.3 percent to $129.25 at the close in  New York ,\ngiving the company a market value of about $9.4 billion.\nRepresentatives for London-based AstraZeneca, Amgen, New York-based Pfizer, Novartis and Onyx declined to comment. There\u2019s no\nguarantee any of the companies will bid.  $61.1 Billion  The interest reflects Onyx\u2019s status as an established\ncompany in the  $61.1 billion  global market for cancer medicines,\nwhich is growing about 5 percent a year, according to industry-data tracker IMS Health Inc. Onyx said June 30 it enlisted\n Centerview Partners  to help find bidders.  The winner would gain control of Onyx\u2019s blood-cancer\ntreatment Kyprolis, which it sells alone and whose sales may\nsurge about ninefold to $2.4 billion by 2019, according to\nanalyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company also gets a\n20 percent royalty on sales of Stivarga for stomach cancer from\n Bayer AG (BAYN) , which has said it expects the drug to be a bestseller.  The biotechnology company also sells Nexavar for liver and\nkidney cancer in partnership with Germany\u2019s Bayer. Onyx reported\n$362 million in 2012 revenue, with 80 percent coming from\nNexavar and Stivarga.  Kyprolis would be a good fit for Novartis, Jefferies & Co.\nanalysts said this month. The Basel, Switzerland-based company\nmarkets Gleevec, a medicine for leukemia, a cancer of the blood\nand bone marrow, and is developing a multiple myeloma drug.  AstraZeneca Focus  AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot wants to focus on core\nresearch areas such as cancer and announced in May that he was\nmoving three experimental cancer treatments into late-stage\ndevelopment earlier than planned. The U.K.\u2019s second-biggest\ndrugmaker advanced development of moxetumomab pasudotox for\nhairy cell leukemia, olaparib for platinum-sensitive relapsed\novarian cancer and selumetinib for non-small cell lung cancer\npatients with the KRAS genetic mutation.  A successful bid for Onyx would help AstraZeneca replace\nsales lost to generic competition as its second-best-selling\ndrug, Seroquel for schizophrenia, no longer has U.S. patent\nprotection. Its patent on Nexium for ulcers, the third-biggest\nseller, expires in the U.S. in 2014.  Pfizer (PFE)  may also be interested in boosting its cancer\nportfolio. An acquisition would give the world\u2019s biggest\ndrugmaker full ownership of palbociclib, an experimental\ncompound being studied for  breast cancer  that could be a\nblockbuster. Onyx has an agreement to get 8 percent of sales of\npalbociclib, if it\u2019s approved.
