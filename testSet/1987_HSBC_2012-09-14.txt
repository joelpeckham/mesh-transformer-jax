The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBanco Cruzeiro do Sul SA  will be\nliquidated by Brazil\u2019s central bank after attempts to find a\nbuyer failed, prompting  Latin America \u2019s biggest corporate-bond\ndefault in more than 10 years.  Officials appointed to run the Sao Paulo-based company\nfound a \u201cserious violation\u201d and unfunded liabilities that made\nit impossible to resume normal operations, Brazil\u2019s central bank\nsaid today in a statement.  Regulators took over Cruzeiro do Sul on June 4, handing\ncontrol to the deposit-insurance fund known as FGC after finding\nviolations of banking rules. The fund last month offered to buy\nback $1.6 billion of bonds at discounted prices as part of a\nrecapitalization plan, and was overseeing efforts to find a\nbuyer for the company, which specialized in making loans backed\nby paychecks.  Cruzeiro do Sul was the sixth lender to need emergency help\nfrom regulators since 2010, prompting investors including\nPrecise Securities\u2019 Carlos Legaspy to say they were becoming\nskeptical of all mid-sized banks in  Brazil . In July, the\ngovernment allowed such lenders to increase sales of debt backed\nby the FGC to help shore up their finances.  Takeover talks with Banco Santander Brasil SA fell apart\nwhen negotiators couldn\u2019t reach agreement on guarantees for\nhidden problems that might arise at Cruzeiro do Sul after a deal\nwas struck, Valor Economico newspaper reported earlier today,\nwithout saying where it got the information.  Buyback Fails  The FGC said today that investors representing 88.7 percent\nof Cruzeiro do Sul\u2019s bonds agreed to the buyback, just short of\nthe 90 percent participation the fund was requiring. The default\nis the biggest in Latin America since Telefonica de Argentina SA\nfailed to pay on $2.9 billion of debt in 2002, according to\n Standard & Poor\u2019s .  Regulators today also liquidated Banco Prosper SA, the\nlender Cruzeiro do Sul said it would acquire in December, and\nsaid they would continue to probe fraud allegations and punish\nanyone found responsible.  \u201cIt is quite healthy to have this kind of reminder every\nonce in awhile that doesn\u2019t pose a systemic threat,\u201d said Pedro Bastos, chief executive officer of HSBC Global Asset Management\nin Brazil, in a phone interview from Sao Paulo. \u201cIt\u2019s an\nimportant reminder that risk and return need to be in line with\nthe investor\u2019s profile.\u201d  Cruzeiro do Sul yesterday jumped  25 percent  in Sao Paulo\ntrading after the FGC extended the deadline for its bond buyback\noffer through 6 p.m.  Sao Paulo  time. It said it needed more time\nto assess the bids.  Banco Panamericano  Brazil took a harder line with Cruzeiro do Sul bondholders\nthan it did with creditors of Banco Panamericano SA in 2010,\nestablishing a precedent Alliance Bernstein LP says may drive up\nborrowing costs for the country\u2019s other mid-size banks.  The FGC bailed out Panamericano, with a market value of\nabout 2.8 billion reais, amid a fraud investigation by the\ncentral bank. Regulators liquidated Banco Morada SA in April\n2011 after finding \u201cserious financial violations\u201d at the Rio\nde Janeiro-based firm.  Other banks bailed out or liquidated in the past two years\nwere Banco Schahin SA, Banco Matone SA, and Oboe Credito\nFinanciamento e Investimento SA.
