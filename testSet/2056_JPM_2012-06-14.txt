The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapan \u2019s ruling party will consider\nlimiting the period for public stock offerings to four days to\ncurtail share declines and discourage  insider trading , said\nlawmaker and former Morgan Stanley banker Tsutomu Okubo.  A  Democratic Party of Japan  working group will discuss\ntruncating the period from the announcement of sales to\nsettlement of the deals from the current minimum 15 days, Okubo\nsaid in an interview. The panel, which meets for the first time\ntomorrow, was set up to examine ways to restore confidence in\nmarkets rocked by trading and accounting scandals.  Japanese regulators are investigating short selling by\ninvestors who used information leaked from underwriters\nincluding  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  before stock offerings were\nannounced. The benchmark  Topix Index (TPX)  has lost 16 percent since\nthe securities watchdog revealed the first case on March 21.  \u201cWe need to discuss how to make the  Tokyo  market\nattractive again,\u201d said Okubo, lead director of the upper\nhouse\u2019s financial affairs committee. \u201cWe should stamp out this\nenvironment that has given investors the desire to conduct\ninsider trading.\u201d  Japanese law requires at least two weeks from the\nannouncement of equity offerings to the conclusion of the\ntransactions, in order to give investors time to decide whether\nto participate. The period also gives shareholders ample time to\nsell the stock on concern about dilution, Okubo, 51, said. That\nfuels the incentive for insider trading as  hedge funds  and asset\nmanagers bet they can sell borrowed stock and buy it back at a\nlower price, he said.  Confidentiality Rules  Under the proposal, lead underwriters would begin marketing\nequity offerings before they are announced, on the basis that\nthey and investors adhere to strict rules on confidentiality,\nwith punishments for breaches, said Okubo, who worked at  Morgan\nStanley (MS)  for about 10 years until entering parliament in 2004.\nThat would bring Japanese practice in line with markets\nincluding the U.S., he said.  \u201cShortening the period will discourage insider trading as\nit will reduce the opportunity to reap gains,\u201d Takashi Kaneko,\na professor of finance at  Keio University  in Tokyo, said in an\ninterview. \u201cIt will also be good for the issuers because they\ncan increase the total amount of financing as the price won\u2019t\nbecome distorted by the short sales.\u201d  Discuss Penalties  The team of 15 DPJ lawmakers will examine current Japanese\nlaws for insider trading and compare them with regulations and\npunishments in the U.S. and  Europe , according to a faxed\ndocument sent to Bloomberg. The group will also discuss how to\npenalize underwriters that provide tips and increase fines for\nthose that trade on them, Okubo said.  \u201cIf Japan\u2019s regulations aren\u2019t sufficient compared with\nthose overseas, we need to strengthen them to bolster\ncredibility,\u201d  Yasuhiro Sato , chairman of the Japanese Bankers\nAssociation, a group that represents the country\u2019s biggest\nlenders, told reporters in Tokyo today. \u201cLead underwriters bear\na heavy responsibility.\u201d  In the four cases revealed by the  Securities and Exchange\nSurveillance Commission  since March, the watchdog has\nrecommended an average fine of 3.7 million yen ($47,000) for the\ninstitutions found to have benefited from insider trading. They\ninclude a former unit of  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. (8309) ,\nAsuka Asset Management Co., and U.S. proprietary trading firm\nFirst  New York  Securities LLC.  The underwriters whose employees leaked the information\nhaven\u2019t been penalized yet.  Nomura Employees  Nomura on June 8 apologized for its employees\u2019 role in\nleaking information ahead of share sales that the investment\nbank managed in 2010. The acknowledgment confirmed that it was\nthe unidentified underwriter found by the SESC to have provided\ninformation on public offerings by  Inpex Corp. (1605) ,  Mizuho Financial\nGroup Inc. (8411)  and Tokyo Electric Power Co.  Mizuho, Japan\u2019s third-biggest bank by market value,\nannounced its 750 billion yen share sale on June 25, 2010. It\nreleased the pricing on July 13 and settled transactions on July\n21. Mizuho  shares  fell about 13 percent during the period.  The SESC found that an employee of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \ngave information on a 2010 offering by Nippon Sheet Glass Co.,\naccording to two people with knowledge of the matter. New York-\nbased JPMorgan said on May 29 that it\u2019s \u201ccooperating fully\u201d\nwith the authorities on the matter.  \u201cIt\u2019s positive to see the public offering period could be\nshortened,\u201d said Kaneko, who studies  equity capital markets  at\nKeio. \u201cBut it may be just a stopgap measure. We need to analyze\nwhat the brokerages\u2019 real motivations are for leaking\ninformation to their clients, and how to eradicate this.\u201d  Okubo led credit and derivative product business at New\nYork-based Morgan Stanley. He became a managing director in the\ninvestment banking department in 2002.
