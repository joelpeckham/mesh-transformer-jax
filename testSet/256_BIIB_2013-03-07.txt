 "context": "The following article called 'Biogen Asked in Suit to Return ALS Biosamples to Knopp' was published on 2013-03-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nKnopp Neurosciences Inc. asked a\nfederal judge to order  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB) , its partner in a failed\nattempt to develop a drug for Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, to turn over\nto Knopp biosamples from patient tests.  U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton scheduled an expedited\ntrial without a jury in June on closely held Knopp\u2019s breach of\ncontract lawsuit against Biogen, according to a filing today in\nfederal court in Boston.  Knopp, based in Pittsburgh, sued Biogen Feb. 25 claiming it\nbreached a licensing agreement the companies had to develop and\nmarket a drug to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as\nALS or Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. Knopp wants Biogen to return the\nbiosamples from its ALS trial, called Empower, and Biogen says\nit isn\u2019t obligated to do so, according to the complaint.  \u201cThe failure to preserve the Empower biosamples, and\nultimately to investigate them using the right tools in the\nright hands, will represent a research setback during which time\nthousands of patients will have died of ALS,\u201d Knopp said in its\ncomplaint.  Gorton, at a hearing in  Boston  today, set four days for a\nbench trial beginning June 17. At the trial, he will also hear\narguments on Knopp\u2019s request for an injunction to prevent Biogen\nfrom destroying or studying any of the samples.  Clinical Trial  Biogen, based in Weston,  Massachusetts , said in January\nthat the drug, dexpramipexole, failed to show any efficacy in a\nlarge clinical trial, in the third and final phase of studies\ngenerally required for regulatory approval. The drug had been\nthought to potentially slow the progression of ALS after\npromising signs in earlier studies.  ALS affects about 30,000 people at any time in the U.S.,\ncausing nerve damage that leads muscles to shut down\nprogressively over three to five years until most patients die\nfrom respiratory failure. There\u2019s just one drug on the market\nfor the disease, Sanofi\u2019s Rilutek, which provides only a modest\nbenefit.  Biogen paid $80 million in cash and stock for a licensing\ndeal in August 2010 with Knopp, which first developed the drug.\nThe trial reported in January showed no efficacy in improving\npatients\u2019 ability to function or extending their lives, Biogen\nsaid in a statement at the time.  Development Halt  Based on the results, Biogen said it would stop development\nof dexpramipexole. That would also lead to a termination of the\nagreement with Knopp.  Biogen fell 98 cents to $171.47 at 5:20 p.m. in Nasdaq\nStock Market  trading . The shares have gained 47 percent in the\npast year.  Knopp\u2019s own analyses of the trial results found \u201csubgroups\nof the total study population that exhibited slower disease\nprogression and reduced mortality when treated with\ndexpramipexole,\u201d according to the complaint. Knopp said it\nwants the patients\u2019 samples from the trial to help it continue\nto try to develop the medicine itself.  Biogen is planning ways to use the biosamples in its own\nALS research, said Dan McIntyre, a spokesman for the company.\nBiogen agreed not to use the samples through June 21, when the\ntrial is expected to conclude, he said.  Study Results  \u201cWhile we\u2019re deeply disappointed in the negative results\nof the Empower trial, we\u2019re confident in the validity of the\nstudy results,\u201d McIntyre said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\ndid additional analyses of multiple sub-populations and they\nfailed to demonstrate any efficacy. If we had found any hope\nourselves, we would have pursued it.\u201d  Knopp claims Biogen is required to return the samples under\nthe terms of the companies\u2019 license agreement. Biogen told Knopp\nit doesn\u2019t believe it has such an obligation, and that patient\nconsent forms prohibit Biogen from transferring them, according\nto the complaint.  Redi Kasollja, a lawyer for Knopp, didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to messages seeking comment on the suit.  The case is Knopp Neurosciences Inc. v. Biogen Idec\nInternational Holding Ltd., 13-cv-10386, U.S. District Court,\nDistrict of Massachusetts (Boston).
