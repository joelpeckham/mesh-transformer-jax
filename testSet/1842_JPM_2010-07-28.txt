 "context": "The following article called 'Air Canada's High Yield Note Sale Shows Renewed Risk Demand: Canada Credit' was published on 2010-07-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAir Canada , the country\u2019s largest\nairline, benefited from a return of appetite for high-yield debt\nas it sold $1.09 billion of notes denominated in U.S. and\nCanadian currency.  \n The carrier issued $600 million of five-year notes that\nyield 9.5 percent and C$300 million ($289 million) of debt of\nthe same maturity that yields 10.375 percent, Bloomberg data\nshow. The company also sold $200 million of 5.5-year debt that\npays 13 percent, the data show.  \n Air Canada said in a statement last week proceeds will be\nused to repay a C$700 million term loan maturing 2014 and for\ngeneral purposes. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Toronto-Dominion Bank,\nMorgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. managed the sale.  \n \u201cRisk appetite is back on now, and they\u2019re coming to\nmarket at a timely moment -- it\u2019s a decent piece of paper for\nthose who can bear the risk,\u201d said  Ric Palombi , a portfolio\nmanager in Calgary at MacLean & Partners, which oversees more\nthan C$1 billion. Palombi didn\u2019t participate in the sale.  \n The notes bring total high-yield debt sales in Canada so\nfar this year close to the record C$1.8 billion reached in 2007,\nsaid  Robert Follis , head of corporate research at the Bank of\nNova Scotia. Companies including RTL-Westcan LP and Garda World\nSecurity Corp. are among issuers that have sold C$1.5 billion of\nhigh-yield debt in 2010.  \n \u201cSeeing the appetite for this deal is indicative of two\nthings, one is that the market is definitely looking for yield,\nand two we haven\u2019t had a lot of issues in Canada recently,\u201d\nFollis said. \u201cThis is tapping into both aspects: there is a\nvery high yield on this issue and there is money to be put to\nuse for the right name at the right spread.\u201d  \n Better Results  \n The debt sale came a week after Montreal-based Air Canada\nreleased preliminary second-quarter results showing its earnings\nbefore various items will surge to as much as C$340 million from\nC$135 million in the same quarter of 2009. The company will\nrelease official results Aug. 5.  \n The yield spread investors demand to own high-yield\nCanadian debt rather than risk-free government debt has fallen\nto 573 basis points, or 5.73 percent, yesterday, from 698 points\non Jan. 4, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  \n Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors\ndemand to own Canadian company debt rather than federal\ngovernment fell to 142 basis points yesterday, according to a\nBank of America Merrill Lynch index.  \n Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce plans to sell $1 billion\nof covered debt in a benchmark reopening of two issues,\naccording to a person familiar with the transaction. The bank\nplans to reopen its 2 percent notes due 2013 and 2.6 percent\nnotes due 2015, each for at least $250 million, said the person,\nwho declined to be identified because terms aren\u2019t set. A\nbenchmark offering is usually at least $500 million.  \n Historic Flight  \n DBRS Ltd. confirmed Canada\u2019s AAA rating, saying that\n\u201cwhile still challenging, Canada\u2019s fiscal position remains the\nenvy of many developed nations and its strong credit profile is\nsupported by a manageable debt burden.\u201d  \n Air Canada was publicly listed in 2006, after its then\nparent ACE Aviation Holdings Inc. restructured under bankruptcy\nprotection. The company said the debt will be secured by\naccounts receivable, real estate interests, spare engines,\nairport slots and other assets.  \n \u201cThis deal is a deal that people got comfortable with\nbecause of the collateral involved,\u201d Palombi said. Still, \u201cAir\nCanada\u2019s history has been difficult. In a downturn, that\ncollateral can go down in value very quickly, so this bond is\nnot for the faint of heart.\u201d  \n \u2018More Comfort\u2019  \n Moody\u2019s Investors Service assigned the notes a rank of B2,\nfive levels below investment grade, and Standard & Poor\u2019s graded\nthem B+, one step higher, according to separate reports. S&P\nsaid it was considering whether to upgrade Air Canada\u2019s CCC+\ncorporate credit rating.  \n \u201cIt gives me a lot more comfort on the financial-risk\nside,\u201d said  Walter Spracklin , an analyst with RBC Capital\nMarkets, who rates Air Canada\u2019s shares as outperform. \u201cThey\u2019re\nretiring C$700 million with C$900 million, so that puts C$200\nmillion extra on the balance sheet, and it\u2019s being done at\nsignificantly lower costs of financing\u201d than the previous\nborrowing, which had a rate of about 13 percent.  \n Spracklin said he has a C$5 target for Air Canada, from\nyesterday C$2.34 4 p.m. close in Toronto trading. Five analysts\nincluding Spracklin recommend buying the shares, one is\n\u201cneutral\u201d and the other expect Air Canada to \u201cmarket\nperform.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Alexandre Deslongchamps  in Ottawa at \n adeslongcham@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 30.01642608642578 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
