 "context": "The following article called 'Nokia Junk Seen in High-Grade Ascent With Microsoft Cash' was published on 2013-09-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBy selling its money-losing mobile-phone business to  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  for $7.2 billion,  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  is\nnow on the cusp of earning an investment-grade rating from the\n bond market .  The company\u2019s $1 billion of 5.375 percent debt due in May\n2019 jumped to a three-year high of 102.9 cents after Nokia said\nMicrosoft agreed to pay 5.44 billion euros for its handset unit.\nThat caused the yield on the junk-rated bonds to fall to 4.79\npercent, just 0.25 percentage point more than the average for\nsimilar-maturity debt with the lowest investment grade of BBB-,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nokia, founded as a pulp and paper maker almost 150 years\nago, is now exiting the mobile-phone business it once dominated\nafter losing customers to Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone and Google Inc.\u2019s\nAndroid system. With the disposal, the Espoo, Finland-based\ncompany will now focus on turning around its network-equipment\nbusiness after gaining full control from Siemens AG last month.  \u201cThey certainly have it within their control to go to\ninvestment grade,\u201d said Sam Morton, a credit analyst at Mizuho\nInternational Plc in  London . \u201cPeople were worried that cash\nburn in the handset unit would eventually erode Nokia\u2019s net cash\nposition. Disposal of this cash-burning entity has alleviated\nthose concerns.\u201d  \u2018Ample\u2019 Cash  The network unit had an  operating profit  on a trailing 12-month basis in the past two quarters after losses from 2007 to\n2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cWe are certainly targeting a return to investment-grade\nstatus,\u201d James Etheridge, a Nokia spokesman, said by e-mail.\n\u201cCombined with the proceeds from today\u2019s transaction, our cash\nsituation will be ample. As such, the starting point will be a\nstrong one.\u201d  Credit-default swaps protecting against a non-payment by\nNokia plunged to 213 basis points, or 2.13 percentage points,\nfrom 529 Sept. 2, making the debt the fourth-cheapest to insure\nin the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index, the European high-yield\nbenchmark, behind Infineon Technologies Holding BV, Grohe\nHolding GmbH and Smurfit Kappa Acquisitions, Bloomberg data\nshow.  Eight companies in the region\u2019s investment-grade barometer\nwere more expensive. The swaps now signal Nokia should have a\nBa1 ranking, one step below investment grade and three levels\nabove its actual rating, according to Moody\u2019s Analytics.  Ratings Cuts  Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut Nokia\u2019s debt to B1 with a\n\u201cnegative\u201d outlook on Aug. 22 after the company bought out its\npartner in the Nokia Siemens Networks venture for 1.7 billion\neuros, citing concern it would be \u201cunlikely to reach break even\non a cash flow basis before well into 2014, at the earliest.\u201d  Standard & Poor\u2019s  lowered Nokia to an equivalent B+ in\nJuly. Investment-grade bonds are rated Baa3 or higher at Moody\u2019s\nand at least BBB- by S&P.  Nokia reported a 27 percent drop in the number of handsets\nsold in the second quarter, contributing to a 24 percent decline\nin revenue, as sales of its Lumia smartphone failed to make up\nfor weakening demand for its older and more basic handsets.  While Nokia claimed 19.3 percent of the global handset\nmarket by units last year, second only to Samsung Electronics\nCo.\u2019s 23.5 percent, it was in eighth place among smartphone\nmakers, with 4.8 percent, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg Industries. Lower prices pushed it to third place in\nhandsets by value, with 5.9 percent behind Samsung, the leading\nmaker of Android phones, and Apple, which together accounted for\n59 percent of the market.  \u2018Cash Concerns\u2019  Nokia reported net cash of 4.1 billion euros at the end of\nthe second quarter. That compares with 4.4 billion euros of\nbonds outstanding, including 1.25 billion euros coming due next\nyear, Bloomberg data show.  \u201cThis satisfies some of the cash concerns that weren\u2019t\npressing as of today, but clearly would have been in the\nfuture,\u201d said  Dave Novosel , a senior analyst at Chicago-based\nbond research firm  Gimme Credit . \u201cThe fact they\u2019ll have such an\ninflux of cash\u201d may make returning to investment grade\n\u201cpossible, but they\u2019ll have to show improvement,\u201d he said.  The company lost its investment-grade ratings last year,\nBloomberg  data  show.  Nokia started in 1865 as a wood-pulp mill on the banks of\nthe Nokianvirta river in southwestern  Finland , from which it\nderived its name. Its businesses evolved from paper, \u201cone of\nthe most influential communications technologies in history,\u201d\nto mobile telecommunications, according to the company\u2019s\n website . It\u2019s also been involved in rubber, cable, forestry,\nelectronics and power generation.  Payment Terms  Microsoft will pay 3.79 billion euros for Nokia\u2019s devices\ndivision and 1.65 billion euros for patents, according to a\nstatement from the companies. The all-cash transaction, subject\nto Nokia investors\u2019 approval, is expected to be completed in the\nfirst quarter of 2014.  Nokia said it will book a gain of 3.2 billion euros, with\nthe sale \u201csignificantly\u201d accretive to earnings, according to\nthe statement. Chairman  Risto Siilasmaa , who will become Nokia\u2019s\ninterim chief executive officer, said at a press conference that\nthe company may return excess capital to shareholders.  \u201cShareholders will probably want to see a lot of that\ngiven back and bondholders will clearly like to see good chunk\nof it stay there in order to cover investment in the network\nbusiness,\u201d said Aengus McMahon, a London-based analyst at ING\nGroep NV. \u201cThere will certainly be tension over how much cash\nthe company will retain or dole out to investors.\u201d  The stock gained 34 percent to 3.97 euros yesterday and was\ntrading at 3.98 euros today, the highest since April 2012.  Nokia\u2019s 5.375 percent bonds traded as high as 105.5 cents\non the dollar yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price\nreporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nTheir 4.80 percent yield falls between 4.54 percent for BBB-rated notes of similar maturities and characteristics, and 5.88\npercent for securities rated BB+, Bloomberg data show.  \u201cThis makes a tiny pinprick in Microsoft\u2019s cash pile,\u201d\nMcMahon said. Nokia is \u201cstill a declining business, but now it\nhas a bucket load of cash, so a lot more time to sort that\nout.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAbigail Moses in London at \n amoses5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Shelley Smith  at \n ssmith118@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Nokia Corporation was 4.059779167175293 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Nokia Corporation was ",
