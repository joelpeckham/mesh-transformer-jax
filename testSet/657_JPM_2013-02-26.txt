 "context": "The following article called 'One-Hundred-Year Bond Backfires as QE Seen Ending: Mexico Credit' was published on 2013-02-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSeven months after investors piled\ninto  Mexico \u2019s 100-year bonds, the world\u2019s longest-dated\ngovernment debt is saddling money managers led by  MFS Investment\nManagement  with the nation\u2019s worst losses.  The $2.7 billion of notes due in 2110 have fallen 15.97\ncents since reaching a record 125.77 cents on the dollar on Aug.\n2, as investors spurn debt more sensitive to changes in  interest\nrates . Yields on the century bonds rose 0.67 percentage point in\nthat span, touching an eight-month high of 5.27 percent last\nweek. That compares with a 0.09 percentage-point drop on\nsimilar-rated emerging-market government debt.  Investors who bought Mexican bonds last year as central\nbanks globally suppressed rates to revive growth are now\nunloading the debt as the Federal Reserve signals it may curb\nasset purchases. Yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries have\nincreased 0.4 percentage point since August. The correlation\nbetween the U.S. notes and century bonds from Mexico, which\nsends about 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor,\ntouched an all-time high in January.  \u201cWe\u2019re at the beginning of what is possibly a very bearish\n bond market ,\u201d Jeremy Brewin, who oversees more than $5 billion\nof fixed-income assets as head of emerging-market debt at Aviva\nInvestors Ltd, said by phone from  London . \u201cYou don\u2019t want to\nown long bonds for the next two to three years.\u201d  \u2018Very Closely\u2019  MFS is the biggest holder of Mexican debt due in 2110,\naccording to regulatory filings compiled by Bloomberg. John Reilly, a Boston-based spokesman for MFS, declined to comment,\nciting a company policy against discussing specific securities\nin its portfolios.  Alejandro Diaz de Leon, the head of public debt in Mexico,\nsaid the selloff in Mexico\u2019s bonds \u201cprecisely reflects\u201d the\nretreat in long-term Treasuries.  \u201cI anticipate that our whole dollar curve is going to\nfollow very closely what happens in Treasuries,\u201d he said in a\ntelephone interview yesterday.  The minutes from the most recent Fed meeting show some\npolicy makers \u201cexpressed some concerns about potential costs\nand risks arising from further asset purchases.\u201d A survey by\nthe  Federal Reserve  Bank of  New York  released on Feb. 21 and\ntaken before the most recent Jan. 29-30 Fed meeting showed\nprimary dealers expected policy makers to reduce the pace of\nasset purchases by the beginning of 2014. A majority anticipated\nan end to mortgage-bond buys by January.  The Fed said Jan. 30 that it will keep buying bonds at a\nrate of $85 billion a month as part of its third round of so-\ncalled quantitative easing, or QE.  \u2018Gotten Whacked\u2019  Mexico\u2019s 100-year bonds are among the most vulnerable to\nthe decline in Treasuries because an increase in yields cuts\nmore value from longer-maturity notes that pay a larger number\nof coupons than shorter-dated debt.  Modified duration, which measures a bond\u2019s sensitivity to\nrate changes, was 18.7 for the 100-year bond. That\u2019s more than\ntwice as much as Mexico\u2019s notes due 2022, which have duration of\n7.6.  Brazil \u2019s longest-dated dollar-denominated bond, which\nmatures in 2041, is 15.1.  \u201cAnything with duration has gotten whacked,\u201d  Kevin Daly ,\na  money manager  who oversees $11 billion in emerging-market\nassets at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, said in a telephone\ninterview from London. \u201cWe have been reducing the duration in\nour portfolio.\u201d  Buying Opportunity  The decline in Mexico\u2019s bonds is creating a buying\nopportunity because Treasury yields are unlikely to climb\nfurther, according to  Enrique Alvarez , the head of Latin America\nfixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in New York.  \u201cIn the shorter run, unless you can predict a very violent\nrise in the long end of U.S. Treasury rates, which I don\u2019t think\nis going to occur, you shouldn\u2019t expect much higher yields in\ntrying to find a better or more attractive rate for entry,\u201d\nAlvarez said in a telephone interview from New York.  Yields on  30-year U.S. Treasuries have dropped 12 basis\npoints, or 0.12 percentage point, in the past week on\nspeculation that U.S. will fail to avert automatic spending cuts\nslated to take place later this year.  The extra yield investors demand to own Mexican dollar\nbonds instead of Treasuries widened six basis points to 185\nbasis points at 11 a.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan Chase\n& Co.  Default Swaps  The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for\nfive years with credit-default swaps rose one basis point to 105\nbasis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-\ndefault swaps pay the buyer face value if the issuer fails to\ncomply with debt agreements.  The peso weakened 0.6 percent to 12.8702 per  U.S. dollar .  An investor holding $10 million of Mexico\u2019s century bonds\nwould incur a loss of $979,000 if the price on the securities\nfell to 100 cents on the dollar from 109.8 cents now, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cAs a long-term investor, we\u2019re not looking at the next\nsix months,\u201d Brewin said. \u201cFrankly, why would I want to own\nsomething that is low-yielding and is subject to all the\nconcerns about duration?\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nBen Bain in Mexico City at \n bbain2@bloomberg.net ;\nBoris Korby in New York at \n bkorby1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nDavid Papadopoulos at \n papadopoulos@bloomberg.net ;\n Michael Tsang  at \n mtsang1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 37.323909759521484 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
