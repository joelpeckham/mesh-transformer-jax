The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of Japan minutes show the\nconcern of \u201ca few\u201d board members that inflation expectations\nmay fail to flow through to actual price increases, leaving the\nBOJ short of its 2 percent goal through March 2016.  Those policy makers say it\u2019s \u201chighly uncertain whether\nchanges in inflation expectations would lead to a rise in the\nactual rate of inflation,\u201d according to the record of an April\n26 meeting, released today in  Tokyo . According to JPMorgan Chase\n& Co., the BOJ uses the term \u201ca few\u201d to mean two.  Japanese stocks tumbled today, adding to volatility that\nthreatens to sap confidence in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s\ncampaign to revive the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. The Topix\nIndex fell 3 percent as of 10 a.m. local time, adding to a 6.9\npercent one-day plunge last week that was the biggest since the\nMarch 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The gauge is still up 35\npercent for the year to date.  Before today\u2019s minutes, the BOJ had already disclosed that\nat least two members see inflation of less than 1 percent in the\nfiscal year ending March 2016. The board\u2019s median estimate is\n1.9 percent, excluding the effects of a planned sales tax\nincrease.  Board members discussed perceptions of a contradiction\nbetween applying downward pressure to  interest rates  through\nlarge-scale purchases of  government bonds  and seeking to fuel\ninflation, which would lead to pressure for higher yields. \u201cA\nfew\u201d members said this had led to fluctuations in financial\nmarkets. One said that potential instability remained in the\n bond market .
