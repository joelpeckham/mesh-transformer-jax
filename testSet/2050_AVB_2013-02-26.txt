The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLehman Brothers Holdings Inc. was\nsued in Denver by former shareholders of its Archstone Inc. unit\nseeking to block a sale of Archstone assets that they claim are\nvalued at $16 billion.  The complaint, filed yesterday in federal court, also names\nas defendants Chicago-based  Equity Residential (EQR) , and another\npublicly traded apartment owner,  AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB) \nbased in Arlington, Virginia.  In December, Equity Residential, founded by billionaire Sam Zell and the largest publicly traded U.S. apartment landlord,\nsaid it will acquire about 60 percent of Archstone in a cash-\nand-stock deal valued at about $16 billion, including debt, with\nAvalonBay buying the other 40 percent.  The plaintiffs are former owners of an Archstone trust who\nclaim that through a 2007 merger with units owned by Tishman\nSpeyer Properties LP, they were \u201ccoerced\u201d to assume a\ndifferent category of ownership \u201cwithout adequate\nconsideration,\u201d according to the complaint.  The pending $16 billion sale \u201cwill leave Archstone an\nempty shell with no assets\u201d from which investors could win a\ncourt judgment in a separate, pending case over the 2007 merger,\naccording to the complaint.  \u201cArchstone will also have nothing from which to satisfy\nits obligations, including distributions, redemptions and tax\nprotections,\u201d the investors said in the complaint.  Lehman Liquidating  Lehman, which is still liquidating and trying to cut claims\nafter exiting bankruptcy court protection last year, has so far\npaid creditors about 9 cents on the dollar, or half of what it\nexpects to pay by about 2016. It said in December that it raised\n$3.9 billion for creditors in the quarter ended Sept. 30 and\nanother $1.6 billion in October and November, while its $6.5\nbillion sale of apartment owner Archstone was due to close by\nMarch 26.
