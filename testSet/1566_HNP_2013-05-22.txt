The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSuntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  tumbled,\nleading a slump in Chinese equities traded in New York, on\nconcern the European Union will impose import duties on  China \u2019s\nsolar products.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded\nChinese stocks in the U.S. slid 2.2 percent to 93.9 yesterday,\nsinking the most in five weeks. Suntech, the biggest solar-panel\nmaker in 2011, plunged as its shares\u2019 50-day volatility surged\nto a four-year high.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE)  fell the\nmost since May 2012, while  Huaneng Power International Inc. (HNP) \nextended losses after Deutsche Bank AG downgraded the stock.\n Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD)  rebounded after a two-day\ndecline.  While officials from the U.S., China and the EU have\nengaged in preliminary talks to settle a dispute over solar-energy products, according to people familiar with the\nsituation, the EU said May 21 it will stick to its June 6\ndeadline to decide on duties. China and the EU failed to reach\nan agreement on export prices in their first round of\nnegotiations, China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency reported\nyesterday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index dropped the most in\nthree weeks amid concern that the Federal Reserve will scale\nback its stimulus efforts.  \u201cIn general, if the EU implements tariffs on Chinese\npanels, that would hurt demand for solar because the price of\nsolar will go up,\u201d Gordon Johnson, an analyst at Axiom Capital\nManagement Inc. in New York, said by phone. \u201cSolars are already\ndecisively more expensive than traditional fossil-based\nenergies. The EU\u2019s tariffs will hurt demand further.\u201d  ETF Plunges  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese\n exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., sank 1.5 percent in New York\nto $37.54, slumping for a second day. The S&P slipped 0.8\npercent to 1,655.30, the most since May 1, after Federal Reserve\nChairman Ben S. Bernanke said in remarks to Congress that the\ncentral bank could \u201cstep down\u201d the pace of asset purchases in\nthe next few meetings if the labor market continues to improve.  Suntech\u2019s American depositary receipts tumbled 20 percent\nto $1.02 in New York, after surging 98 percent in the previous\nthree days. Fifty-day volatility on the stock soared to 211\nyesterday, the highest level since January 2009. That would\ncompare with an average of 105 over the past year.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the Chinese solar-panel maker that has\nreported seven straight quarters of losses, dropped 19 percent\nto $1.66, retreating from a four-month high.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) ,\nalso based in Changzhou, lost 15 percent to $6.11, while Yingli\nGreen Energy Holding Co. sank 15 percent to $3.02, after posting\na 44 percent gain in a three-day advance.  The rally earlier this week was partly due to solar\nmanufacturer\u2019s mixed earnings, according to Axiom\u2019s Johnson.  Solar Earnings  JA Solar Holdings Co., the largest solar-cell producer by\ncapacity, said May 20 first-quarter shipments exceeded the\nShanghai-based company\u2019s forecast on strong demand in  Japan .\nYingli, the world\u2019s largest solar-panel maker, reported a day\nlater first-quarter shipments declined less than it had\npreviously forecast, according to preliminary figures.  \u201cThe market\u2019s ignoring negative earnings and reacting very\nfavorably to positive earnings,\u201d Axiom\u2019s Johnson said. \u201cJA\nSolar results reported this week were slightly better than\nexpected. People got very excited about this because the stocks\nhad been beaten down and everyone was looking for a bottom.\u201d  Options trading and investors buying shares to cover their\nshort sales are \u201cexacerbating\u201d moves in the Chinese solar\nstocks, increasing their volatility, Chris Kettenman, Chief\nEnergy Strategist at Prime Executions Inc. in New York, said by\nphone yesterday. In a short sale, an investor borrows a security\nand sells it, expecting to profit from a decline by buying it\nback at a lower price.  ADRs of Huaneng, China\u2019s biggest electricity producer,\nslipped 2.5 percent to a one-month low of $41.50, extending a\nthree-day slump to 16 percent. Its Hong Kong-traded shares fell\n8.3 percent to HK$7.94, or $1.02, yesterday. Each ADR represents\n40 shares.
