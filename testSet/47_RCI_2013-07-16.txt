 "context": "The following article called 'Former Anschutz Boss Charts Leafs Victory Parade Route' was published on 2013-07-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTim Leiweke , the new chief of Maple\nLeaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd., is so confident the Toronto\nMaple Leafs will soon end a 46-year Stanley Cup drought that\nhe\u2019s mapped a victory-parade route for the hockey team.  \u201cI have it planned out and it\u2019s going to be fantastic,\u201d\nLeiweke said yesterday in his first interview since taking over\nthe Toronto-based sports group, which owns the city\u2019s National\nHockey League franchise, as well as the Raptors basketball team\nand Major League Soccer\u2019s Toronto FC. While employees at MLSE\nwere a little shocked he mentioned winning the Stanley Cup so\nsoon after starting the job on June 3, Leiweke said the company\nhas to focus on results.  \u201cIf you can all dream about that and get that in your\nmind, we\u2019ll have something we\u2019re all driven toward,\u201d he said he\ntold them.  Leiweke joined Maple Leaf Sports from Anschutz\nEntertainment Group, owned by Denver billionaire Phil Anschutz,\nwhich controls MLS\u2019s Galaxy club and the Los Angeles Kings\nhockey team and is part-owner of the LA Lakers basketball\nfranchise. In his 13 years with AEG, the Lakers and Galaxy each\nwon four league titles and the Kings clinched one Stanley Cup.  The challenge of moving from that winning environment to\nloss-prone Toronto appealed to Leiweke.  Wither Raptors  \u201cIf the teams were doing well, I wouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d\nLeiweke, 56, said in Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cWhat\nintrigued me the most is the opportunity to have an organization\nhere that can aspire to be much more successful and a greater\nbrand than it currently is.\u201d  The National Basketball Association\u2019s Toronto Raptors\nhaven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2008 while Toronto FC has never\nhad a winning season or qualified for the playoffs since their\ninception in 2007. The Maple Leafs made the playoffs for the\nfirst time since 2004 this year, only to fail to make it past\nthe first round after giving up a three-goal lead to the Boston\nBruins in the third period of game seven.  Leiweke, who stresses the importance of patience as a means\nto building long-term success, saw upside in that stinging loss,\ncalling it \u201cthe best thing that could have happened to\u201d the\nLeafs.  \u201cI think they need a few ass-kickings, and that\u2019s one that\nwill stay with them for a long time,\u201d he said of the players.\n\u201cI think it will pay huge dividends in the long term no matter\nhow painful it was.\u201d  \u2018Nonis Fan\u2019  Leiweke said a key component to an eventual Cup-winning\nLeafs squad will be general manager Dave Nonis, whose contract\nis being renegotiated.  \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have some news on that very soon,\u201d\nLeiweke said. \u201cI\u2019m a big Dave Nonis fan, and I want a culture\nhere that is different than the one I stepped into.\u201d  Winning is especially important for the Maple Leaf brand,\nwhich has the potential to be a Top 10 or even Top 5 global\nsports brand, Leiweke said.  \u201cIf you look around world, the great brands are Real\n Madrid , Manchester United. The Yankees, the Cowboys and the\nLakers are there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should aspire with the Maple\nLeafs to be there.\u201d  BCE Inc. (BCE)  and  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) , Canada\u2019s two\nlargest telecommunications companies, acquired control of Maple\nLeaf Sports in 2012 to add hundreds of hours of programming they\ncan sell to sports fans on their smartphones and tablets. The\ntwo companies together generated profit of C$4.32 billion ($4.14\nbillion) last year.  \u2018Knee-Jerking\u2019  Having to answer to the chiefs of two publicly traded\ncompanies is a change from Anschutz but one Leiweke says he\u2019s\nhappy with.  \u201cOur owners know we\u2019ve got to be patient and stop knee-jerking like we have in the past,\u201d he said.  In return he\u2019s pledged to double the value of Maple Leaf\nSports in the next five to seven years.  \u201cWinning does a lot of that, 30 percent minimum comes just\nfrom winning,\u201d he said.  One option is to bring a National Football League team\nnorth of the border. While NFL ownership rules prevent\ncorporations from owning teams, Leiweke said Maple Leaf Sports\nplans to be involved in any effort to bring a team to  Canada  and\nexpects one in Toronto.  \u201cIt is a safe bet to say we\u2019ll have some role there, to be\ndetermined, but that\u2019s on our radar screen,\u201d he said. \u201cI know\nthe league well and if we can help in that we will certainly try\nto help.\u201d  Cross-Country  Maple Leaf Sports can also drive fresh profit from planned\nrenovations to its Air Canada Centre arena and by being more\ncreative with live entertainment and broadcasting, he said.  The company, which also owns the Toronto Marlies of the\nAmerican Hockey League, is open to acquiring non-hockey-related\nsports franchises in Canada, Leiweke said.  The Raptors, the only NBA team in Canada, should carry the\nsame level of cross-country appeal as the Toronto Blue Jays, the\nonly Canadian Major League Baseball team, he said. Much like\nToronto FC, the Raptors\u2019 mediocrity has eroded fan support.  \u201cWe need to be a lot better than we are right now, because\nright now we\u2019re not very good,\u201d Leiweke said. \u201cWe have 35\nmillion people that are our audience. We own Canada, it is our\nhome, our territory and our region and we have to act like it.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m not even sure we deserve Toronto,\u201d he said.  Leiweke hired Masai Ujiri, the NBA\u2019s reigning executive of\nthe year for his work with the Denver Nuggets, to run the\nRaptors after firing Bryan Colangelo in June.  \u2018Suck to Be Good\u2019  \u201cI didn\u2019t get along with the GM of the basketball team, so\nwe brought in somebody who sees the world the same way I do,\u201d\nLeiweke said.  Next year\u2019s NBA draft is going to have many good players\nthe Raptors may be interested in to build up a team over time.  The owners \u201care very aware that we may ultimately have to,\nexcuse my English, suck to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand\nthey\u2019re going to have to be patient there.\u201d  Leiweke brought David Beckham to the Los Angeles Galaxy,\ntransforming the city\u2019s soccer scene and MLS in the process.\nToronto FC\u2019s support has declined with the team\u2019s\nunderperformance. Its once-loyal fan base of \u2018Red Army\u2019 season\nticketholders has dropped to 200 from 800 in recent years,\nLeiweke said.  \u201cWe had the best brand in Major League Soccer,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of damage to the brand.\u201d  \u2018Significant Signing\u2019  Maple Leaf Sports needs marquee players like Beckham to\nbring those fans back and improve the team\u2019s fortunes, Leiweke\nsaid.  Multiple outlets have  reported  Toronto FC\u2019s possible\ninterest in acquiring Uruguayan international and former Chelsea\nstriker Diego Forlan. Leiweke declined to comment on the\npossibility of Forlan coming to Toronto.  \u201cWe better have a significant signing or this erosion\nwe\u2019re currently experiencing\u201d will continue, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re\ntalking to a lot of DPs,\u201d as designated players who don\u2019t count\ntoward a team\u2019s salary cap are known.  Winning above all is key to turning Maple Leaf Sports\naround, Leiweke said. That may mean sacrificing a few sacred\ncows, particularly for the Leafs, who haven\u2019t won a Stanley Cup\nsince grabbing four from 1962 to 1967 despite being the richest\nteam in the NHL.  \u201cI don\u2019t want the players walking in the hallways of the\nAir Canada Centre and seeing pictures from 1962,\u201d Leiweke said.\n\u201cGet rid of those pictures and tell them, this is your\nlegacy.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nHugo Miller in Toronto at \n hugomiller@bloomberg.net ;\nEric Lam in Toronto at \n elam87@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nNick Turner at \n nturner7@bloomberg.net ;\nDavid Scanlan at \n dscanlan@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Rogers Communication, Inc. was 30.18911361694336 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Rogers Communication, Inc. was ",
