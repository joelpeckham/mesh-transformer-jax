 "context": "The following article called 'US Airways Said to Approach AMR Bondholders on Merger' was published on 2012-04-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUS Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  is targeting\n AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) \u2019s unsecured creditors committee to build support for a\npossible takeover bid for bankrupt  American Airlines  after\nwinning the backing of the carrier\u2019s biggest unions.  Agreements with the labor groups were a \u201cbig step\u201d as US\nAirways progresses from the unions to the creditor panel and\neventually to AMR\u2019s board, Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker\nsaid today on a conference call with analysts and investors.  \u201cWe are eager to demonstrate to the creditors of AMR that\nour plan would result in higher returns than the AMR stand-alone\nstrategy,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe\u2019re highly confident the value\ncreated by our two companies is very large relative to the value\nof a stand-alone AMR.\u201d  While formal meetings haven\u2019t been held, talks began last\nweek with bondholders of  Fort Worth , Texas-based AMR, two people\nfamiliar with the matter said.  US Airways  rose 3.1 percent to\n$9.60 at the close in New York, as a rally after Parker spoke\nsent the shares to a sixth gain in eight trading days.  Parker didn\u2019t say when Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways\nmight make an approach to AMR, which has said it prefers to\nremain an independent airline while in court protection. CEO  Tom Horton  has said the  third-biggest  U.S. carrier would prefer to\nexit Chapter 11 and then consider possible combinations.  Creditors Committee  US Airways\u2019 merger efforts were backed last week by three\nunions at American, representing pilots, flight attendants, and\nmechanics and bag handlers. Each group is on AMR\u2019s nine-seat\ncreditors committee, so support from two more members would give\nUS Airways a majority.  \u201cIf they can line up support from unions, bondholders and\nunsecured creditors, I think they can get themselves awfully\nclose to what would amount to a hostile takeover,\u201d Max Newman,\na bankruptcy attorney at  Butzel Long  in  Bloomfield Hills ,\n Michigan , said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly being very\nstrategic and creative about how they\u2019re going about it.\u201d  The panel has a voice in any major decisions made while a\ncompany restructures in bankruptcy. Bondholders are represented\non the committee by Manufacturers & Traders Trust,  M&T Bank\nCorp. (MTB) \u2019s Wilmington Trust and  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. \nSpokesmen for the banks declined yesterday to discuss US\nAirways\u2019 initial overtures or didn\u2019t return calls seeking\ncomment.  Boeing\u2019s View  Boeing Co. (BA) , which also sits on the panel, supports American\n\u201cemerging from this thing as a stronger airline,\u201d CEO Jim McNerney said on a conference call today. If the carrier and a\nmerger partner eventually decide on a tie-up, \u201cwe\u2019ll support\nthat as well.\u201d  AMR\u2019s 9.75 percent notes due August 2021 jumped 21.5 cents\nto 45 cents on the dollar at 9:51 a.m. in  New York , according to\nTrace, the bond-price reporting service of the Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority. US Airways\u2019 7.1 percent notes due\nApril 2021 rose 0.5 cent to 103.75 cents on the dollar. The\nyield fell to 6.54 percent.  AMR probably will consider a merger as part of its\nbankruptcy case because stakeholders will want to ensure they\nare getting the highest possible value, according to a financial\nadviser for the airline, Rothschild Inc.\u2019s David Resnick.  \u201cThey would want the debtor to look at alternatives to a\nstand-alone plan,\u201d Resnick, Rothschild\u2019s chairman of global\nfinancing advisory, said today in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in\n Manhattan , where AMR was urging Judge Sean Lane to grant\npermission to void union contracts in its restructuring.  Reorganization Rights  AMR holds the sole right to file a reorganization plan\nthrough Sept. 28, although the creditors committee can ask the\ncourt to end that privilege if the panel concludes there is a\nviable alternative. The company filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 29.  A combined airline would produce savings and new revenue of\n$1.2 billion a year, excluding the increased labor costs, US\nAirways President Scott Kirby said on the conference call,\ncalling that a conservative estimate.  \u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of value created by merging\nUS Airways and AMR,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can and should use a portion\nof that to give employees more than AMR can on stand-alone\nbasis.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMary Schlangenstein in Dallas at \n maryc.s@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nEd Dufner at \n edufner@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of M&T Bank Corporation was 67.45527648925781 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of M&T Bank Corporation was ",
