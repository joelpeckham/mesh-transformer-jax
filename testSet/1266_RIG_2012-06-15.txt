 "context": "The following article called 'Ex-BP Engineer Faces February Trial in Spill Criminal Case' was published on 2012-06-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA former  BP Plc (BP/)  engineer charged\nwith destroying evidence sought for a U.S probe of the 2010  Gulf\nof Mexico   oil spill  will face a Feb. 25 trial, a judge said.  Kurt Mix, who worked on internal BP efforts to estimate the\namount of oil leaking from the well, was charged with two counts\nof obstruction of justice for allegedly deleting text message\nstrings from his mobile phone. Mix has pleaded not guilty.  U.S. District Judge Stanwood Duval in New Orleans set the\ntrial date at a scheduling conference with lawyers for the U.S.,\nBP and Mix on June 13. His order was filed with the court\nyesterday. The judge also directed the government to \u201cprovide\nall non-expert and expert\u201d evidence to Mix by June 29.  The blowout and explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling\nrig killed 11 workers and started millions of barrels of crude\nleaking into the Gulf. The Mix prosecution is the first criminal\ncase to arise from the 2010 spill.  The  Justice Department , which began investigating the\nincident in June 2010, said in April it was weighing whether to\nfile more criminal charges over the spill. The charges against\nMix are likely to be followed by others, U.S. Attorney General\nEric Holder said that month.  \u2018Day in Court\u2019  \u201cKurt Mix looks forward to his day in court,\u201d Joan McPhee, Mix\u2019s attorney, said in a phone interview.  Alisa Finelli, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department,\ndeclined to comment.  A U.S. grand jury had been investigating the spill\nestimates,  Federal Bureau  of Investigation Special Agent Barbara\nO\u2019Donnell said in a sworn statement filed April 23 in the Mix\ncase.  \u201cMix deleted numerous electronic records relating to the\nDeepwater Horizon disaster response, including records\nconcerning the amount of oil potentially flowing from the well,\nafter being repeatedly informed of his obligation to maintain\nsuch records,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said in the statement.  Mix deleted the e-mails in October 2010 despite receiving\nmultiple notices from London-based BP in the weeks after the\nspill, \u201cwhich stated on the cover, in bold and underlined type,\nthat instant messages and  text messages  needed to be\npreserved,\u201d the U.S. said in its indictment issued May 2.  Mix brought the deletions to the attention of the\ngovernment, McPhee said at his arraignment last month.  \u2018Thousands of E-mails\u2019  \u201cMr. Mix saved thousands of e-mails and hundreds of text\nmessages,\u201d McPhee said. The information saved includes flow\nrate data, work on the efforts to contain the spill, and his\npersonal log notes, she said.  The Deepwater Horizon accident prompted hundreds of\nlawsuits against London-based BP;  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the Vernier,\nSwitzerland-based owner and operator of the rig; and  Halliburton\nCo. (HAL) , which provided cementing services.  The U.S. government also filed a lawsuit against BP,\nTransocean and BP\u2019s partners in the well,  Mitsui & Co. (8031) \u2019s MOEX\nOffshore 2007 and The Woodlands, Texas-based  Anadarko Petroleum\nCorp. (APC) , alleging violations of federal pollution laws.  Louisiana \nand Alabama sued as well. MOEX has settled the federal pollution\nclaims.  U.S. District Judge  Carl Barbier , who is overseeing these\nlawsuits in New Orleans, set a Jan. 14 date for a nonjury trial\nto determine fault for the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon\ndrilling rig and resulting undersea leak.  $7.8 Billion  BP agreed to pay an estimated $7.8 billion to resolve most\nprivate plaintiffs\u2019 claims for economic loss, property damage\nand spill and cleanup-related injuries. The settlement, reached\nMarch 2, days before a scheduled trial on liability for the 2010\nspill, doesn\u2019t cover federal government claims and those of Gulf\nCoast states Louisiana and Alabama.  It also excludes claims of financial institutions, casinos,\nprivate plaintiffs in parts of Florida and  Texas , and residents\nand businesses claiming harm from the Obama administration\u2019s\nmoratorium on deep-water drilling prompted by the spill. The\nplaintiffs\u2019 and government claims against BP\u2019s contractors on\nthe doomed Macondo well also remain.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Mix, 12-cr-0017, U.S. District\nCourt, Eastern District of Louisiana ( New Orleans ). The civil\ncase is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater Horizon in the\nGulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S. District Court,\nEastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).
