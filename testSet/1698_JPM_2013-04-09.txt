News  Ex-Prosecutor White Wins Senate Approval as New SEC Chairman  The Senate confirmed former Manhattan U.S. attorney and\nDebevoise & Plimpton LLP partner Mary Jo White to lead the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, putting her in charge of an\nagency that has failed to satisfy critics with its response to\nthe financial crisis.  The Senate approved White by unanimous consent, meaning no\nsenators objected to her appointment, as the first former\nprosecutor to run the SEC. She succeeds Elisse B. Walter, who\nhas served as chairman since  Mary Schapiro  stepped down in\nDecember.  White overcame questions about her past work for financial\ninstitutions such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and\n UBS AG. (UBS)  White, 65, will retire from Debevoise, where she earned\n$2.4 million last year, she said in an ethics disclosure letter.  The SEC regulates  stock exchanges , brokers and money\nmanagers, and imposes penalties for violations of  securities\nlaw . It has been governed by only four commissioners -- two\nDemocrats and two Republicans -- since Schapiro left.  The addition of White means the commission, now with three\nDemocratic appointees, could move forward more quickly with new\nregulations. It has been considering rules covering restrictions\non money-market mutual funds, executive-pay disclosure and\nfinancial advisers to municipalities.  The commission may proceed slowly under White because she\nlacks a background in policy making. Her Senate nomination\nhearing last month yielded few details about her regulatory\nphilosophy.
