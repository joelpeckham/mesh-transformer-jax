 "context": "The following article called 'Australia Unexpectedly Raises Rates; Currency Jumps' was published on 2010-11-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Reserve Bank of Australia\nunexpectedly increased its benchmark interest rate on concern\nstronger growth will cause inflation to accelerate, driving the\nnation\u2019s currency to parity with the U.S. dollar.  Governor  Glenn Stevens  raised the overnight cash rate\ntarget a quarter point to 4.75 percent in Sydney, saying the\neconomy has \u201crelatively modest amounts of spare capacity\u201d and\nciting risk of \u201cinflation rising again over the medium term.\u201d\nIt was the RBA\u2019s first move in six months.  The move signals Stevens wants to avoid a repeat of 2007,\nwhen he held off raising rates for months as slowing inflation\nmasked a buildup in price pressures. Growth in Australia, which\nskirted a recession during the crisis, may strengthen as energy\ncompanies such as  BG Group Plc  add construction jobs.  \u201cThey\u2019re trying to nip inflation in the bud,\u201d  Matthew Circosta , an economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in Sydney, said on\nBloomberg Television. \u201cBack in 2007 they were behind the\ncurve\u201d in raising rates and \u201cI don\u2019t think they want to make\nthe same mistake this time around.\u201d  The Australian dollar climbed to $1.0003 as of 7:25 a.m. in\nLondon from 98.82 cents before the announcement. The S&P/ASX 200\nIndex of stocks was little changed at 4,701.40.  The  decision , predicted by seven of 24 economists surveyed\nby Bloomberg News, was the second straight in which Stevens\ndefied the majority of economists\u2019 forecasts.  Fed Meeting  Stevens\u2019s move comes a day before the U.S. Federal Reserve\nmeets to consider pumping additional stimulus into the world\u2019s\nlargest economy. The divergence in monetary policies has stoked\nthe Australian dollar, which has gained about 11 percent this\nyear against the U.S. currency.  Australia\u2019s jobless rate, at 5.1 percent in September, is\nabout half the level of unemployment in the U.S. and euro zone.\nThe International Monetary Fund predicts Australia\u2019s growth will\nadvance to 3.5 percent next year from 3 percent this year as\nresources investment intensifies.  \u201cWhile the labor market is not as tight as in 2007 and\n2008, some further strengthening would appear to be in prospect,\njudging by the trends in job vacancies,\u201d the central bank said\nin today\u2019s  statement . \u201cAfter the significant decline last year,\ngrowth in wages has picked up somewhat, as had been expected.\nSome further increase is likely over the coming year.\u201d  A \u201cmoderation\u201d of inflation for the past two years \u201cis\nprobably now close to ending,\u201d the RBA said.  Employment Surge  Two days ago,  BG Group  said it will begin building a $15\nbillion liquefied natural gas venture in Queensland state,\ngenerating 5,000 construction jobs. Investment there and in\nWestern Australia, including  Chevron Corp. \u2019s A$43 billion ($42.5\nbillion) Gorgon liquefied natural gas project, is growing\nbecause of stronger Chinese demand for raw materials.  \u201cThe bank still sees Australian interest rates as likely\nto continue to rise as the mining boom progresses,\u201d said  Ivan Colhoun , head of Australian economics at Australia & New Zealand\nBanking Group Ltd. \u201cThis likely reflects the need to move\nnominal rates higher to match any rise in inflation and, at some\nstage, to also raise real interest rates too.\u201d  Today\u2019s increase was announced half an hour before the\nrunning of the Melbourne Cup, dubbed \u201cthe race that stops the\nnation,\u201d and means the central bank has moved borrowing costs\nin the past five meetings on the day of Australia\u2019s richest\nhorse race.  Banks\u2019 Response  Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the nation\u2019s biggest home\nlender, will raise its standard mortgage interest rate by almost\ndouble the central bank\u2019s increase. CBA\u2019s standard variable home\nloan interest rate will be increased by 45 basis points, or 0.45\npercentage point, to 7.81 percent on Nov. 5, the Sydney-based\nbank said today.  Borrowing costs at ANZ and Westpac Banking Corp. are under\nreview, according to spokesmen at the lenders. National\nAustralia Bank Ltd. spokesman  George Wright  said no decision has\nbeen made \u201cat this stage.\u201d  Treasurer  Wayne Swan  has urged banks not to boost borrowing\ncosts by more than central bank increases, calling CBA\u2019s move a\n\u201ccynical cash grab.\u201d Australian politicians are sensitive\nabout rate increases as more than two-thirds of the population\nown homes, compared with less than 50 percent in some European\nnations.  Australia\u2019s central bank signaled after its Oct. 5 meeting\nthat the decision to leave borrowing costs unchanged was\n\u201cfinely balanced\u201d with the case for an increase, as a rising\ncurrency helped ease inflation concerns. Most economists had\nforecast a quarter percentage-point increase at that meeting.  Price Measures  While the government\u2019s consumer price index rose 0.7\npercent from the second quarter, less than the 0.8 percent\nmedian estimate in a Bloomberg News survey, that may be\nshrouding intensifying price pressures. An Oct. 7 report showed\nthe biggest back-to-back monthly job increases since 1988.  The central bank\u2019s measures of core inflation showed annual\nprice increases also slowed last quarter. The bank aims to keep\ninflation in a range of 2 percent to 3 percent on average.  Stevens had paused after boosting borrowing costs in six\nquarter-point steps from October 2009 to May this year, the most\naggressive round of rate increases among Group of 20 members.  Companies such as  BHP Billiton Ltd. , Rio Tinto Group and BG,\nthe U.K.\u2019s third-largest oil and gas producer, have helped spur\na hiring surge as they increase shipments of iron ore, coal and\nenergy to China.  The growth in mining investment was a reason IMF staff last\nweek said Australia is starting to exhibit \u201cearly signs\u201d of\ninflation pressures.  \u201cWith inflation projected to remain close to the top of\nthe 2-3 percent target band, the RBA needs to guard against\ninflation expectations becoming anchored at too high a level,\u201d\nthe IMF staff said in an Oct. 29 report.  Among 33 members of the Paris-based Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, Australia last year was\nthe only advanced economy to avoid two consecutive quarters of\ncontraction  -- a standard definition of a recession -- along\nwith developing economies Slovakia and Poland.
