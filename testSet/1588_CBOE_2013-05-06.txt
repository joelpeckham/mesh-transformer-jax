 "context": "The following article called 'BOX Exchange Gets SEC OK to Trade Jumbo S&P 500 ETF Options' was published on 2013-05-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBOX Options Exchange, the third-\nsmallest of 11 U.S. options venues, will be the first to begin\ntrading larger-size contracts on the most-active U.S. equity\nderivatives product, according to a company executive.  BOX will list and trade contracts based on 1,000 shares of\nthe SPDR  S&P 500  ETF Trust starting May 10, according to Ed Boyle, senior vice president for strategy at the Boston-based\nexchange. The so-called jumbo options,  approved  May 3 by the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, will be 10 times larger than\nexisting contracts on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index exchange-\ntraded fund, known by the ticker symbol SPY.  The contract is designed to give institutional investors\nanother way to trade the S&P 500 at a time when many asset\nmanagers are increasing their use of ETFs as part of their\ninvestment strategies. Institutions often use larger-size\ncontracts like S&P 500 options that enable them to buy or sell\nbigger positions without signaling their intentions and moving\nthe market.  \u201cWe see customer demand for the product because it offers\nflexibility to institutions and traders looking for larger\nnotional size in trades,\u201d Boyle said by phone. \u201cIt also\nprovides additional price competition across indexes and ETFs.\u201d  The contracts, which will be a separate product from the\nregular-size options based on 100 shares of the S&P 500 ETF,\nalso offer an alternative to indexes such as the S&P 500, which\ntrades exclusively on the  Chicago Board Options Exchange , Boyle\nsaid.  ETF Popularity  Some 18 percent of institutional investors in the U.S. now\nhave ETFs among their holdings, up from 14 percent in 2012,\naccording to a report today from research firm Greenwich\nAssociates.  BOX\u2019s pricing, which will be announced in the middle of\nthis week, will not be the standard taker/maker structure the\nvenue uses for many options, Boyle said. The taker/maker regime\npays firms to trade with bids and offers on the exchange and\ncharges those providing quotes.  If daily average volume exceeds 20,000 contracts by the end\nof the year, BOX will consider the jumbo SPY options a success,\nBoyle said. The exchange may ask the SEC for permission to\nintroduce jumbo options on other actively traded ETFs including\nthose based on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  and Nasdaq-100\nIndex, he said.  Other options exchanges are likely to list and trade jumbo\n SPY (SPY)  options, Boyle said. BOX, owned by the operator of the\nToronto stock market and a group of brokers, asked permission to\ntrade the product in January. The SEC approval came over\nobjections by  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX\nGroup Inc.  BOX had 2.2 percent of U.S. volume in April, according to\n data  compiled by Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp.
