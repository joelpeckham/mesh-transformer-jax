 "context": "The following article called 'Schulze Said to Enlist Cerberus to Help Cement Best Buy Bid' was published on 2012-11-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBest Buy Co. founder Richard Schulze\nis working with three private-equity firms, including Cerberus\nCapital Management LP, on a takeover of the electronics chain as\nhis deadline to review the company\u2019s finances nears, said people\nfamiliar with the matter.  Schulze, 71, is asking the  retailer  for an extra 30 days to\nconduct due diligence, said the people, who asked not to be\nnamed because the process is private. TPG Capital and  Leonard\nGreen  & Partners LP also are working with Best Buy\u2019s former\nchairman on arranging financing, they said. The three private-\nequity firms are working separately for now, said one of these\npeople, though could work together eventually on a final bid.  Schulze and these firms have been studying Best Buy\u2019s\nconfidential  financial data  since mid-September. The retailer\ngranted him 60 days to put together a proposal after he revealed\nAug. 6 that he would offer as much as $26 a share for the\ncompany. Other firms such as  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and\nKKR & Co., which had considered bids, are now unlikely to work\nwith Schulze on an offer, according to one of the people.  Schulze and his allies pressed for the 30-day extension,\nwhich would take them into late December, so they could see how\nBest Buy performs over the holidays before they agreed to fund\nwhat would be one of the largest buyouts in years, said one of\nthese people. The retailer, which lost $1.2 billion in its\nlatest fiscal year, is working to improve same-store  sales  amid\nescalating competition from Amazon.com Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores\nInc.  Third-Quarter Results  Today the company said profit in the third quarter ended\nNov. 3 was 3 cents a share, excluding some items, falling short\nof the average analyst estimate of 12 cents, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Best Buy also reduced its  forecast  for\nfree  cash flow  for the year to at least $850 million, from a\nprevious minimum of $1.25 billion.  Best Buy\u2019s finances have deteriorated so much in recent\nmonths that some of the private-equity funds have gone back to\ntheir investment committees to warn them of the changes, said\nanother person involved in the process. Amy von Walter, a\nspokeswoman for Richfield, Minnesota-based Best Buy, declined to\ncomment. A spokesman for Schulze didn\u2019t return a call or e-mail\nseeking comment.  John Dillard , a spokesman for Cerberus at  Weber Shandwick ,\nand Michael Gennaro, Leonard Green\u2019s chief operating officer,\ndidn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.  Owen Blicksilver , a\nspokesman for TPG at Owen Blicksilver Public Relations, declined\nto comment.  Solo Financing?  Best Buy has received Schulze\u2019s request for the extension\nand may grant it in the next few days, said one of these people.\nBest Buy and its financial and legal advisers are holding off on\nthe approval to see if Schulze has made progress in lining up\nfinancing, said this person.  While one of the three private-equity firms has told\nSchulze it could provide financing solo, the founder\u2019s camp\nwould prefer to have two or more entities working together so no\none has too much influence, said another person.  Schulze, who is working with Credit Suisse Group AG on the\nfinancing for the deal, is also receiving advice from Jack Ryan,\na former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker in  Chicago  who briefly\nran a campaign for  U.S. Senate  against  Barack Obama  in 2004,\nsaid these people.  Schulze and former Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Brad Anderson are meeting this week with current Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly, said two of the people. Anderson is taking a growing role\nin Schulze\u2019s effort to line up investors in a buyout, said one\nof these people.  Schulze, who still owns more than 20 percent of the\nretailer, offered Aug. 6 to take Best Buy private at $24 to $26\na share. Its falling stock price and declining earnings have\nmade some directors more willing to pursue a deal with Schulze,\na person familiar with the matter said last week. Best Buy sank\n13 percent to $11.96 at the close in  New York .
