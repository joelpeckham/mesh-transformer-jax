 "context": "The following article called 'J&J Failed to Warn of Hip Implant\u2019s Risks, Jurors Told' was published on 2013-01-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)  failed to warn\ndoctors of the risks of defective metal hip implants that it\ndidn\u2019t test properly, a lawyer told a Los Angeles jury in the\nfirst of 10,000 lawsuits over the device to go to trial.  Loren Kransky, a retired prison guard who got an ASR XL hip\nimplant in 2007, sued in state court in 2011 and had the device\nreplaced last year. J&J, the world\u2019s biggest seller of  health-\ncare products , withdrew the devices in August 2010 after citing\nU.K. data showing more than 12 percent failed within five years.  \u201cThe ASR XL was dangerous and it was defective in design\nand we will prove it,\u201d Michael Kelly, Kransky\u2019s lawyer, said\ntoday in his opening statement. \u201cThis hip, this medical\nimplant, incorporated dangers to an extent beyond what any\nreasonable doctor would have anticipated or expected.\u201d  Kelly claimed that debris from the metal ball sliding\nagainst the metal cup caused metal ions to enter Kransky\u2019s\nbloodstream, and one of his doctors said the poison would kill\nhim without replacement surgery. Kelly said J&J\u2019s DePuy\nOrthopaedics unit knew the ASR hips were failing and never told\ndoctors. Analysts estimate that the litigation could cost J&J\nbillions of dollars.  Sound Bites  J&J and DePuy deny Kransky\u2019s claims, including failure to\nwarn, defective design and negligent recall. In his opening, J&J\nlawyer Alexander Calfo said Kelly stitched together \u201csnippets\nof e-mails, smidgeons of depositions and sound bites of memos\u201d\nto paint a false picture of DePuy.  \u201cWhen you hear the evidence of what actually happened with\nMr. Kransky, you will see that story you just heard really isn\u2019t\nthe story,\u201d Calfo told jurors. \u201cDePuy is simply not the\ncompany the Kransky lawyers claim.\u201d  J&J faced 10,100  lawsuits  through September, according to a\nregulatory filing. Most pretrial collection of evidence is\nconsolidated in federal court in Toledo, Ohio, where 7,240 cases\nare pending, and California state court in San Francisco, where\nmore than 2,000 cases are filed. Other cases were filed in state\ncourts around the U.S.  The company said in January 2012 that it had spent about\n$800 million on hip recalls during the prior two years. J&J\ndidn\u2019t provide an estimate of its product-liability costs.  Rejected Offer  J&J offered to pay more than $200,000 a case to settle most\nof the 10,000 lawsuits, according to five people familiar with\nthe matter. The deal\u2019s cost could exceed $2 billion if most\nplaintiffs accept the terms. Lawyers for hip recipients have so\nfar rejected the offer, the people said.  Kelly said DePuy designed a metal cup that was supposed to\nstay squarely in the hip and not shed debris into the body. The\ndesign failed on both counts, he said, releasing cobalt and\nchromium debris into patients as the cup loosened, he said.\nDePuy did limited testing in machines and not people, he said.  \u201cThey chose not to do a controlled clinical study on\npeople,\u201d Kelly said.  DePuy, which sold the device around the world, began\ngetting reports of problems as early as January 2005, he said.\nHe cited a June 2005 e-mail from an Irish marketing official who\nsaid she was \u201cquite concerned about our failure rate.\u201d  She also wrote an e-mail in June 2006 about a doctor in the\nNetherlands who was considered a \u201ckey opinion leader\u201d and who\nconducted a study that found \u201csignificant failure for the\nASR,\u201d according to Kelly. The doctor said he wouldn\u2019t implant\nthe device anymore, Kelly said.  \u2018Big Problem\u2019  \u201cThis isn\u2019t some doctor who is invisible, untrained or\ninept,\u201d he said. DePuy had information that \u201cwe have a big\nproblem. A key opinion leader for an entire country is done with\nus.\u201d  J&J said in court papers that Kransky smoked since he was\n12, broke his back when he was 15, and was exposed to Agent\nOrange when he served as a U.S. Air Force mechanic in  Vietnam .\nHe suffers from diabetes, coronary artery disease, high blood\npressure, and kidney disease. He had two strokes and suffers\nfrom kidney cancer, according to the company.  Kelly said that in October 2011, Kransky had as much as\nseven times the normal level of cobalt in his body. Cobalt, he\nsaid, kills human cells.  Kransky\u2019s lawyers are planning to call doctors who treated\nhim to testify the former guard was \u201cpoisoned by the chromium\nand cobalt\u201d released by the artificial hip, according to court\nfilings.  In his opening, Calfo said that cobalt and chromium from\nthe ASR hips don\u2019t poison patients, including Kransky.  \u201cThe ASR was thoroughly tested and was researched before\nit was ever used,\u201d Calfo said.  Massive Attack  Kransky\u2019s medical conditions also weren\u2019t caused by the ASR\nhip. Kransky, he said, had \u201ca massive sustained attack on his\nblood vessels totally unrelated to the ASR.\u201d  Kransky\u2019s diabetes, high blood pressure and elevated\ncholesterol caused his health problems, Calfo said.  \u201cMr. Kransky had extensive medical conditions affecting\nhis health long before he got the ASR,\u201d Calfo said.  Calfo said that Kransky\u2019s kidney problems compromised his\nbody\u2019s ability to flush chromium and cobalt, which weren\u2019t at\nhigh enough levels to cause health problems.  The Kransky case is Kransky v. DePuy, BC456086, California\nSuperior Court, Los Angeles County (Los Angeles). The\nconsolidated federal case is In re DePuy Orthopedics Inc., ASR\nHip Implant Products Liability Litigation, 10-MD-2197, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Northern District of  Ohio  (Toledo).
