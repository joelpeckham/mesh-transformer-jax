 "context": "The following article called 'Ex-Deutsche Bank Traders Said to Sue Over Libor Probe' was published on 2013-07-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Bank AG (DBK)  was sued for\nwrongful termination by four traders fired in the bank\u2019s probe\ninto alleged rigging of interbank lending benchmarks such as\nEuribor, two people familiar with the matter said.  Another banker, who was the most junior of a group of five\nfired in February, reached a settlement with the bank, said the\npeople, who asked not to be identified as the matter isn\u2019t\npublic. The other employees are suing the bank in  Frankfurt ,\nGesine Brackert, a spokeswoman for the labor court said, without\ncommenting on the reasons for the dismissals.  Regulators from  Canada  to  Switzerland  are investigating\nwhether more than a dozen lenders, including Deutsche Bank,\ncolluded to rig benchmark  interest rates  including Libor and\nEuribor for profit or to mask their true cost of borrowing.\n Barclays Plc (BARC) , UBS AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc have\npaid a total of about $2.5 billion in fines after admitting\nwrongdoing.  \u201cUpon discovering that certain employees acted\ninappropriately, we sanctioned or dismissed employees, clawed\nback the unvested compensation of employees, and we will\ncontinue to do so as we complete our investigation,\u201d said\n Ronald Weichert , a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank.  The lender has fired at least seven employees over\nsuspected misconduct in connection with rates. The bank,\ncontinental  Europe \u2019s largest by assets, said in February that\nwhile it would fire or suspend workers that acted\ninappropriately, it wouldn\u2019t identify individuals.  Managing Directors  The traders that filed the employment lawsuit were based in\nFrankfurt and consisted of two managing directors, two directors\nand a vice president, two people with knowledge of the matter\nsaid in February. Submitting euro interbank offered rates was\npart of their responsibilities, the people said.  The Frankfurt labor court attempted to negotiate a\nsettlement between the traders and Deutsche Bank in April,\nBrackert said. A hearing on the dispute scheduled for August has\nbeen postponed until September at the earliest, she said. Court\ndocuments in German lawsuits aren\u2019t publicly available.  Inappropriate Communication  Deutsche Bank justified the dismissal of the employees in\nFebruary by saying they had inappropriate communication with a\ntrader the bank fired at the end of 2011 for trying to rig\nrates, said one of the people familiar with the matter.  Deutsche Bank isn\u2019t the only lender to terminate traders\nover the rates probes. RBS has fired seven people for Libor-related misconduct, including two managers, a person familiar\nwith the matter said in April. More than 25 people have left UBS\nafter an internal review of interest-rate manipulation, a person\nfamiliar with the matter said in November.  Barclays has disciplined 13 employees and dismissed five,\n Rich Ricci , the bank\u2019s former head of corporate and investment\nbanking, told British lawmakers in November.  Deutsche Bank said last July that its internal rates probe\nfound misconduct by individual employees though no wrongdoing by\ncurrent or former board members.  Joaquin Almunia , the European Commission\u2019s antitrust chief,\nsaid earlier this month that he\u2019s seeking to settle probes into\nthe London Interbank Offered Rate and Euribor by year end.
