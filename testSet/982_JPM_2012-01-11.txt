The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWashington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ) , the former\nowner of the biggest U.S. bank to fail, can seek approval of the\nlatest version of its $7 billion payout plan, a bankruptcy judge\nruled, rejecting a request from lower-ranking creditors.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath in Wilmington, Delaware,\nrefused to halt consideration of the company\u2019s plan until a\ndistrict court rules on an appeal by the holders of the so-\ncalled trust preferred securities. Those investors, including\nBlack Horse Capital LP and Lonestar Partners LP, last year lost\ntheir court battle to have Walrath define their securities as\ndebt instead of equity.  \u201cThe harm to all the other creditors and stakeholder in\nthe case, I think, would be enormous,\u201d Walrath said in a\nhearing today.  Washington Mutual is preparing to try for the third time to\nwin approval of its payout play after settling the objections of\nits main critics, including shareholders.  The trust-preferred investors hold about $1.5 billion in\nconvertible debt that Walrath ruled became shares in WaMu when\nthe company filed bankruptcy in 2008. Shareholders will collect\na fraction of what debt holders will collect under WaMu\u2019s\nproposed payout plan.  WaMu, based in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 26,\n2008, the day after its banking unit was taken over by\nregulators and sold to  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase & Co. for $1.9 billion.\nWashington Mutual Bank had more than 2,200 branches and $188\nbillion in deposits.  The case is In re  Washington Mutual Inc. (WM) , 08-12229,  U.S.\nBankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).
