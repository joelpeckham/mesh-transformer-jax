The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAequitas Innovations Inc. said  BCE\nInc. (BCE)  and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System have\njoined a group including  Royal Bank of Canada  and Barclays Plc\nas investors developing an alternate exchange in Canada.  Joanne Kearney, a spokeswoman with Aequitas, said BCE,\nCanada\u2019s largest telecommunications provider, and Omers Capital\nMarkets, which manages the public investments of government\nemployees in Ontario, are founding investors in Aequitas and\neach assumed a seat on the board of directors as of yesterday.  Aequitas brought in fund managers as investors as it plans\nto compete for buy and sell orders in a Canadian market\ndominated by TMX Group Ltd., which owns the Toronto Stock\nExchange, TSX Venture Exchange, Alpha and TMX Select trading\nplatforms. TMX\u2019s exchanges had about 82 percent of equity\ntrading by volume as of June, according to  data  from the\nInvestment Industry Regulatory Organization of  Canada .  \u201cTo our knowledge, we will be the only exchange globally\nthat has an ownership weighted towards the buy side,\u201d Kearney\nsaid in an e-mail.  The investors, which also include CI Financial Corp., IGM\nFinancial Inc., ITG Canada Corp. and PSP Public Markets Inc.,\neach own no more than 15 percent of Aequitas, Kearney said. She\ndeclined to disclose individual stakes.  The Ontario Securities Commission yesterday  submitted  a\nrequest for comment regarding the proposal from Aequitas, ahead\nof a formal application for recognition as an exchange.  \u2018Hybrid\u2019 Market  The company is proposing a \u201chybrid\u201d market that will\ncombine elements of traditional public stock exchanges with so-called dark pools, where some data on trades is not revealed in\norder to protect the interests of buyers and sellers. Aequitas\nsaid the exchange will be designed to \u201crestrict predatory\ntrading.\u201d The hybrid market is the first of its kind and\nAequitas has filed a patent for its design, Kearney said.  \u201cWe see untapped opportunity to use innovative technology\nand marketplace design in a way that promotes liquidity,\nfairness, cost savings and economic growth,\u201d Aequitas said in a\n statement  disclosing the BCE and Omers investments.  Aequitas plans to submit its application to the provincial\nregulator in late fall 2013 and expects to receive a recognition\norder next spring. The company\u2019s exchange will be operational by\nlate 2014.  Jos Schmitt, chief executive officer of Aequitas, was not\navailable for comment, Kearney said. Carolyn Quick, spokeswoman\nwith TMX Group, would not comment about the planned exchange.  \u201cBCE has made a small private equity investment in\nAequitas as a commercial partner providing communications\nsolutions to our venture,\u201d Jason Laszlo, a spokesman with BCE,\nsaid in an e-mail.  Omers, the country\u2019s sixth-largest fund manager by assets,\ndeclined to disclose the size of its stake.  \u201cOmers believes that Aequitas can create additional choice\nfor trading in Canada -- bringing the buyers and sellers of\nsecurities together efficiently and cost-effectively,\u201d Brent\nRobertson, director of trading at Omers Capital Markets, said in\nan e-mail statement.
