 "context": "The following article called 'Apax Said Halfway to Raising $12 Billion Fund as Washington State Invests' was published on 2011-12-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApax Partners LLP, the British\nprivate equity firm that purchased U.S. wound-care company\nKinetic Concepts Inc. last month, has amassed about half of the\n9 billion euros ($11.7 billion) it is seeking for its latest\nfund, three people with knowledge of the plans said.  The firm, headed by Martin Halusa, has told investors it\nplans to announce a so-called first close as soon as next month,\nallowing it to start spending the money, said the people, who\ndeclined to be identified because the plans are private.\n Washington State Investment Board  yesterday approved a $300\nmillion commitment to the pool, almost twice the amount it\ncommitted to Apax\u2019s previous fund, according to Liz Mendizabal,\na spokeswoman for the  pension plan .  The Washington state pension plan\u2019s board recommended the\ninvestment \u201cin part, on the firm\u2019s strong and experienced team,\nlong-term track record, focused investment strategy, proactive\ndeal sourcing and global presence,\u201d according to minutes of the\nmeeting sent by Mendizabal.  Apax, started three decades ago as a venture capital firm,\njoins competitors including BC Partners Ltd.,  Sweden \u2019s EQT\nPartners AB and Cinven Ltd. in trying to raise money as\ninvestors cut back commitments to European leveraged buyouts.\nOne in five investors, or limited partners, intends to reduce\nits holdings in European funds because of the sovereign-debt\ncrisis, according to a Dec. 12 survey by Coller Capital Ltd.  New Look  Apax hasn\u2019t been immune to the European debt crisis, with\ninvestments including British discount retailer New Look Group\nLtd. suffering from the economic slump. The clothing retailer,\nwhich postponed an initial public offering last year, posted a\n40 percent drop in profit in the year through March.  Apax VII, the firm\u2019s previous pool raised in 2007, had\ngenerated an 8.1 percent net internal rate of return as at the\nend of June, according to WSIB\u2019s  website . A spokesman for\nLondon-based Apax declined to comment on fundraising.  Private-equity firms, which are seeking to raise $711\nbillion globally, raised 46 percent less in the third quarter\nthan in the previous quarter as the European debt crisis\ndeepened, according to London-based research firm  Preqin Ltd. \nMeanwhile, the value of takeovers announced by private equity\nfirms dropped 40 percent to $85 billion from the previous\nquarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apax has over the past two years sold a 10 percent stake in\nthe firm to sovereign-wealth funds China Investment Corp.,\nAustralia\u2019s Future Fund and Government of Singapore Investment\nCorp.  Fund Fees  The firm will charge investors 1.5 percent of the size of\nthe fund in management fees. It will also keep 20 percent of the\nprofit after generating a minimum annual return of 8 percent,\naccording to documents used to market the pool to investors.\nApax employees will invest 400 million euros in the latest fund,\ncalled Apax VIII, the documents show.  Buyout firms such as Apax typically use loans secured on\nthe targets they acquire to finance more than half of the\npurchase price and cash from their own funds for the rest. The\nfirms seek to improve performance at the companies they acquire\nor expand them before selling them within about five years.
