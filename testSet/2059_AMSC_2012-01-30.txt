 "context": "The following article called 'Sinovel Earnings to Drop 50% as Rivalry Damps Turbine Prices' was published on 2012-01-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) ,  China \u2019s\nbiggest wind-turbine maker, expects to report a decline of more\nthan 50 percent in 2011 earnings as heightened competition at\nhome and abroad dragged down prices.  Rivalry on the market eroded sales prices, trimming revenue\nand profit margins, the Beijing-based company said today in a\nstatement. \u201cCyclical fluctuations\u201d in the world economy also\ndelayed some projects, curbing income, it said.  Sinovel has been buffeted by Western rivals including\n Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  of Denmark and  Gamesa Corp. Technologica\nSA (GAM)  of  Spain , which have reduced costs to compete with Chinese\nmanufacturers. Vestas announced plans to lower expenses by more\nthan 150 million euros ($197 million) this month, losing 2,335\njobs, and warned it may cut 1,600 more in the U.S. if a tax\ncredit isn\u2019t extended.  \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for these guys to drive costs down at the\nsame pace as revenue, so margins are getting squeezed,\u201d Aaron Chew, an analyst with Maxim Group LLC in  New York , said today by\ntelephone. Sinovel may still fare better than European\ncounterparts such as Vestas because of lower labor expenses and\nmore advantageous government subsidies in China, he said.  Lower Support  Vestas has cut sales forecasts twice since October after\nAsian competitors grabbed market share and U.S. and European\ngovernments reined in support for renewable power to curb budget\ndeficits.  The wind-turbine industry as a whole faces falling profits,\naccording to Sean McLoughlin, an analyst at HSBC Bank Plc in\n London . Manufacturers are grappling with overcapacity and\ncompetitive pricing as well as dwindling subsidies for renewable\nenergy, he said by e-mail.  A tighter government approval process for projects in China\nhas intensified competition further, spurring domestic companies\nto study expansion elsewhere. \u201cWe do not expect growth in wind\ninstallations in China in 2012 to 2014,\u201d so growth abroad would\nallow the main Chinese players to boost sales, McLoughlin said.  Vestas announced 346 megawatts of new Chinese orders in the\nfirst half of 2011 and 48 megawatts in the second, Haakon Levy,\nan Oslo-based analyst at DnB NOR ASA, said in an e-mail. That\ncompares with 331 megawatts of new orders in the second half of\n2010, indicating a \u201cslowing Chinese market,\u201d he said.  Goldwind Expansion  Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., China\u2019s\nsecond-largest wind-turbine maker, bought two 10-megawatt wind\nfarms in  Montana  this month and has taken orders in seven other\nU.S. states since it started sales in the region in June 2010.  The U.S. wind industry may install more than 9 gigawatts of\nturbines this year, up from about 6.5 gigawatts in 2011, as\ndevelopers rush to get tax breaks due to expire at year-end,\naccording to researcher Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Sinovel used to be the largest customer of turbine-part\nmaker  American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC)  The Devens, Massachusetts-\nbased manufacturer is now suing the Chinese company over a\ncontractual and intellectual-property dispute.  \u201cSinovel\u2019s attempts to expand abroad have been hampered\nwith the ongoing dispute with AMSC, while Goldwind has been\nacquiring wind-farm projects in the U.S. to build track-\nrecord,\u201d Levy said.  Sinovel had a profit of 2.86 billion yuan ($451.6 million)\nin 2010. The Chinese government has promoted investment in clean\nenergy generation to diversify away from coal, which fuels 70\npercent of the economy and contributes to pollution that\nblankets industrial areas from  Hong Kong  to Beijing.
