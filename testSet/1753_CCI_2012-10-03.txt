 "context": "The following article called 'Credit Swaps in U.S. Fall to 2-Week Low; Crown Castle Plans Bond' was published on 2012-10-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk\nfell to the lowest level in two weeks as companies added more\njobs than estimated last month.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a\ncredit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge\nagainst losses on corporate debt or to speculate on\ncreditworthiness, decreased 2.2 basis points to a mid-price of\n96.1 basis points at 4:50 p.m. in New York, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Contracts tied to  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) \nrose to the most since July.  The measure dropped as ADP Employer Services said companies\nadded 162,000 jobs in September, exceeding the 140,000 median\nestimate of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, allaying\ninvestor concern that the recovery is weakening. The Institute\nfor Supply Management\u2019s index of U.S. non-manufacturing\nbusinesses rose to 55.1 last month, up from 53.7 in August.\nReadings above 50 signal expansion.  \u201cWe still believe that this is a slow-growth environment\nwith modest job growth,\u201d  John Donaldson , director of fixed\nincome at Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Haverford Trust Co., said\nin a telephone interview. Corporate bonds remain attractive as\n\u201cone of the few answers to both yield and call protection,\u201d\nenabling investors to \u201cminimize reinvestment risk,\u201d he said.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor\nconfidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts\npay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its\nobligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point\nequals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of\ndebt.  Crown Castle  Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI) , the junk-rated provider\nof infrastructure for wireless communications, sold $1.65\nbillion of 5.25 percent notes that mature in 2023, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from the  bond issue , along\nwith cash and funds from its revolving  credit line , may be used\nto help finance the company\u2019s purchase of rights to operate\ncellular towers of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) \u2019s T-Mobile USA unit,\nHouston-based Crown Castle said today in a statement.  APA Group (APA) , the Australian natural gas transporter, sold\n$750 million of 3.875 percent, 10-year notes in its first U.S.\nbenchmark bond sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nProceeds from the issue, made through its APT Pipelines Ltd.\nfinancing unit, will be used to pay existing debt and for\ngeneral corporate purposes, a person familiar with the offering\nsaid.  Relative Yields  The average relative yield on speculative-grade debt rose 1\nbasis point, led by the spreads on junk-rated bonds of  utility\ncompanies , which widened 4 basis points, Bloomberg data show.\nHigh-yield, high-risk securities are rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service and less than BBB- by  Standard & Poor\u2019s .  Credit swaps tied to Hewlett-Packard rose 28.9 basis points\nto 302.3 basis points, the highest level since July 23, at 3:30\np.m. in New York, according to data provider CMA, which is owned\nby McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the\nprivately negotiated market.
