 "context": "The following article called 'Obama Lead Over Romney in Foreign Policy Tested in Debate' was published on 2012-10-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFrom the start of his re-election campaign, President  Barack Obama \u2019s aides have said national security would be the toughest flank for opponents to penetrate.  Instead, the president who oversaw the killing of  Osama bin Laden , persuaded NATO to help bring down Libya\u2019s Muammar Qaddafi and ended the  Iraq war  has been put on the defensive, over the Sept. 11 attack in Libya that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.  In tonight\u2019s final presidential debate, devoted to foreign policy, the different paths Obama and  Mitt Romney  favor will be on trial. The president emphasizes working with allies to put pressure on adversaries; his Republican rival stresses U.S. military might and says he\u2019d be tougher on Russia, China, Iran and terrorists. While many of their core policies are similar, even small contrasts may mean a lot.  The distinctions may be \u201cdetail or nuance, but I will tell you as a former practitioner, those actually make a huge deal of difference,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a Defense Department and State Department adviser under Presidents  George H.W. Bush  and George W. Bush who now advises the Romney campaign.  Romney has no foreign policy experience. His election-year trip overseas was marred by his insult to the U.K. over the Olympics, the suggestion he\u2019d give Israel carte blanche to attack Iran, and remarks that Palestinians saw as insensitive.  Romney has sought to stake out differences on issues from the  Middle East  to China to Russia, and on Pentagon spending.  Here are some key areas where the candidates will argue their positions during the debate at 9 p.m., Washington time, at Lynn University in  Boca Raton , Florida:  Libyan Terror  The deaths at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya gave Republicans an opening to question whether Obama\u2019s support for Arab Spring rebellions has worked out better for the U.S. or for Islamic radicals; whether the killing of bin Laden has caused the president to become complacent about other Islamist threats, and whether Obama\u2019s promised withdrawal of all U.S. combat forces from Afghanistan will risk it becoming a terrorist haven again.  Benghazi-Attack Furor May Limit Diplomats in Risky Places Polls show Romney has narrowed what had been Obama\u2019s wide lead with voters on foreign policy and terrorism. Obama led Romney 47 percent to 43 percent in an Oct. 4-7 Pew Research Center  poll  on the question of who would make wiser decisions. That was down from a 53 percent to 38 percent Obama lead in a survey last month by Washington-based Pew.  Varied Explanations  Romney and his allies have hammered at the Libya question. Even though Obama condemned \u201cacts of terror\u201d the morning after the deadly incident, for nine days the administration characterized the attack as growing out of a protest against an anti-Muslim film made in the U.S.  Romney also has seized on revelations that there were requests for additional security before the attack to the State Department, which is conducting an investigation.  Senator Lindsey Graham  of South Carolina said yesterday that the president must have known of the security risks and didn\u2019t take action. Speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d he also criticized the Obama administration for failing to attribute the attack to terrorists immediately afterward.  On the same program, Democratic Senator  Dick Durbin  of Illinois said evidence at the time supported the president\u2019s cautious approach. He cited a Washington Post column indicating the CIA believed the attack may have been in reaction to the anti-Muslim video that sparked demonstrations in several Islamic countries.  Local Radicals  Bloomberg News  reported last week that evidence matches neither the Obama administration\u2019s initial accounts nor Republican portrayals of the incident. There wasn\u2019t a peaceful demonstration against the film that grew violent, nor an al- Qaeda planned attack. Instead, it was a hastily organized act by local men using weapons widely available in Libya, according to evidence at the scene and U.S. officials who saw the intelligence and asked for anonymity to discuss it.  While Obama has expanded a CIA drone program to target terror suspects in countries including Pakistan and Yemen, the Republicans portray Obama as slow to react to new Islamist threats from Libya, Mali, Somalia and Yemen.  Obama\u2019s record shows he approaches crises case by case: He backed U.S. military intervention to support the popular uprising in Libya yet hasn\u2019t done the same in Syria; he distanced the U.S. from allies in  Egypt  and Yemen during anti- government protests while standing behind Arab monarchs.  Romney talks about \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d and getting tougher with \u201cenemies.\u201d  \u2018Nuanced Gray\u2019  \u201cBarack Obama, wartime president though he is, continues to see the world still in nuanced gray -- the color of engagement and diplomacy,\u201d said  Aaron David Miller , a Mideast analyst who served in Republican and Democratic administrations.  \u201cMitt Romney, should he be elected, will start off seeing the world more in black and white -- the color of muscular rhetoric, American exceptionalism and unapologetic nationalism,\u201d said Miller, who\u2019s now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.  One of Romney\u2019s most pointed attacks has been over Iran, charging that the Islamic Republic is closer to acquiring a nuclear weapon than when Obama took office.  Obama has worked with European allies to impose the toughest economic penalties ever on Iran, and Iranian officials have blamed the sanctions for their financial troubles, including the freefall of their currency. Obama has also enlisted Russia and China\u2019s help in pressing Iran to resume nuclear negotiations.  Preferred Path  Romney says he agrees that sanctions and negotiations are the preferred path to resolving the dispute. Like Obama, he says he\u2019d use military force rather than allow Iran a nuclear weapon.  The Obama administration denied a report in the New York Times yesterday that Iran has agreed to direct talks with the U.S. on its nuclear program. Ohio Republican Senator  Rob Portman , who has been helping Romney prepare for his debates, said Sunday the U.S. shouldn\u2019t engage in one-on-one talks with Iran. That would \u201cjettison our allies\u201d who have held a united stance with the U.S., he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d  Romney has tried to persuade voters that his threat of a preemptive military strike against Iran is more credible than Obama\u2019s. He has accused Obama of throwing \u201cIsrael under the bus,\u201d playing off the strained relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu , who has pressed for a more aggressive U.S. stance on Iran.  War Trigger  While Obama and Netanyahu have differed over what threshold might trigger such a strike, the U.S.-Israeli alliance remains strong. Israeli Defense Minister  Ehud Barak  said in July that no president has done more for Israeli security than Obama.  The U.S. has provided Israel $3 billion in annual military assistance since 2007, and Obama boosted aid by helping Israel finance and develop its \u201cIron Dome\u201d defense against short- range rockets from the Lebanese Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah. And the U.S. and Israel are holding their largest joint air and missile defense exercise.  On Afghanistan and Syria, it\u2019s difficult to identify concrete policy differences.  Romney said he would end the combat mission and transition to Afghan-led security by the end of 2014, which the president and NATO allies already have pledged to do. At the same time, Romney has criticized Obama for announcing plans to withdraw all combat troops and has said he\u2019d change course if military commanders advised him to.  Syrian Arms  On Syria, Romney has advocated that the rebels should be better armed, though he hasn\u2019t said the U.S. should do this itself.  The Obama administration, like several NATO partners, is giving non-lethal assistance to the opposition, while coordinating with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have been arming the rebels. Both candidates have opposed sending U.S. troops into the conflict.  Romney has pledged to \u201cget tough\u201d on China and declare the nation a currency manipulator on \u201cday one.\u201d During the second debate, on Oct. 16 in Hempstead, New York, he said doing so would allow him as president to impose tariffs if China is taking \u201cunfair advantage of our manufacturers.\u201d  Declaring a country a currency manipulator would set Romney apart from both Obama and President  George W. Bush , who resisted pressure from Congress to cite China for keeping its currency weak, thus making U.S. exports more expensive. Critics of Romney\u2019s plan say the act would invite retaliation by China, which held $1.15 trillion in U.S. Treasuries as of August.  Obama has touted tariffs he imposed on Chinese tires. His administration has taken two auto-related complaints to the  World Trade Organization . Since 2009, the U.S. and China have had trade disputes over steel, tires, chicken parts, rare earth elements, electronic payments and government support for clean energy technology.  China\u2019s Reaction  The campaign rhetoric drew a rebuke from China last week. The official Xinhua News Agency said ties could be hurt if the debates turn into a \u201cChina-bashing competition.\u201d  \u201cThe fierce presidential race seems to have morphed into a contest in which the one who plays tougher on China has better chances to win,\u201d Xinhua said in a commentary.  Romney\u2019s tough words on China have drawn business concern. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobbying group, opposes his pledge to designate China a currency manipulator, David Chavern, the chamber\u2019s executive vice president, said last month at a Bloomberg Government breakfast in Washington.  Maurice \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg, former chairman of  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  and a director of the U.S.-China Business Council, said Romney will reverse his position on China if he wins. \u201cI think he will change his mind\u201d if elected, Greenberg, a Romney supporter, said in an Oct. 11 interview.  No. 1 Foe  Romney has singled out Russia as the \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe\u201d of the U.S. and ridiculed Obama for what Romney says is a failed effort to \u201creset\u201d relations. Romney accuses Obama of giving in to Russian pressure to weaken U.S. missile-defense plans in central Europe, and getting nothing in return.  Though Romney devoted fewer than 200 words to foreign policy in his speech at the Republican National Convention, he made a point to say Russian President  Vladimir Putin  would see \u201cless flexibility and more backbone\u201d from him.  Obama was caught on an open microphone in March telling Russia\u2019s then-President Dmitry Medvedev that Obama would have \u201cmore flexibility\u201d to address issues such as missile defense after he\u2019s re-elected, and that Putin, who would be returning to office, needed to give Obama \u201cspace.\u201d  The Obama administration credits Russian cooperation in permitting the resupply of U.S. troops in Afghanistan for the more than half a year when Pakistani land routes were closed. Russia has also backed tougher sanctions on Iran.  Pentagon Budget  Romney has said the U.S. military is in danger of becoming a \u201chollow force\u201d under Obama because of potential cuts of as much as $1 trillion over 10 years, reductions negotiated as part of the bipartisan Budget Control Act last year. He says he would reverse those cuts -- which were approved by lawmakers including his running mate, Wisconsin Representative  Paul Ryan  -- and instead increase defense spending until it equals 4 percent of gross domestic product, an increase of about $2 trillion over 10 years.  Obama also opposes the threatened cuts and called upon Congress to pass an alternative. He has opposed Romney\u2019s call for boosting defense spending as unaffordable.  Romney\u2019s overriding critique of Obama has been to attack his worldview, accusing the president of traveling abroad apologizing for America and \u201csnubbing its allies.\u201d  While Obama said in a 2009 speech in France that \u201cthere have been times where America has shown arrogance,\u201d he also criticized Europe for \u201canti-Americanism.\u201d  Different Worldviews  Supporters of both men say the lens through which they see the world is different.  \u201cPresident Obama came in believing the way you deal with the world is you reach out to your enemies,\u201d said Romney supporter Cohen, a professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.  Romney \u201cbelieves you start with your friends,\u201d Cohen said.  \u201cPragmatic versus ideological is how I\u2019d characterize\u201d Obama\u2019s foreign policy worldview compared with Romney\u2019s, said Brian Katulis, a fellow at the Center for American Progress, a policy institute, and an adviser to the Obama campaign.  In a September Pew poll, voters ranked foreign policy behind the economy, health care, education and other issues in their list of priorities.  To contact the reporters on this story: Indira A.R.
