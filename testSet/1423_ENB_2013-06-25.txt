 "context": "The following article called 'Enbridge Line Shutdowns Sap Output as U.S. Crude Gains on Europe' was published on 2013-06-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEnbridge Inc. (ENB) \u2019s shutdown of Alberta\npipelines capable of moving 1.17 million barrels a day toward\nU.S. markets is shrinking output and boosting U.S. crude to the\nhighest level against  Europe \u2019s benchmark oil since 2011.  The company\u2019s Athabasca and Waupisoo lines, carrying oil\nfrom northern Alberta\u2019s rapidly expanding oil-sands operations\nto hubs farther south, remained closed today, with the exception\nof a segment from Cheecham to Hardisty. Nexen Inc. and  Suncor \nEnergy Inc. (SU) , facing transportation limits, cut output.  Restricted pipeline flows to the U.S., dependent on  Canada \nfor 25 percent of oil imports, are buoying U.S. benchmark West\nTexas Intermediate crude to the highest level against European\ncounterpart North Sea Brent in almost 30 months. A prolonged\noutage would support a further narrowing of the WTI-Brent gap,\nalready forecast to shrink to $5 a barrel this year as new\nconduits bring Canadian and U.S. shale oil to the Gulf Coast.  \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear how long they\u2019re going to be\ncompletely down,\u201d  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates\nLLC in Houston, said by telephone yesterday. \u201cEvery additional\nday that Enbridge Canada is down supports the WTI price.\u201d  Alberta, where oil output is on course to more than double\nto 3.8 million barrels a day by 2022, sent 1.7 million a day to\nthe U.S. in 2011,  provincial government  figures show.  Kinder\nMorgan Inc. (KMI) \u2019s Trans Mountain and  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) \u2019s Keystone\npipeline expansions are being proposed to help move Alberta\u2019s\ngrowing oil volumes to markets elsewhere in Canada and the U.S.  West Texas Intermediate for August delivery on the  New York \nMercantile Exchange climbed 14 cents to settle at $95.32 a\nbarrel yesterday. The oil\u2019s  discount  versus Brent narrowed 4\ncents to $5.94, the smallest since January 2011, and was back\nabove $6 in electronic trading late yesterday.  WTI Rises  The WTI-Brent gap will narrow to $5 by the end of 2013 as\npipeline capacity moving oil from Canada and U.S. shale plays to\nthe Gulf Coast increases and demand for the crudes rise, Vikas Dwivedi, a Houston-based global energy strategist for  Macquarie\nGroup (MQG) , said in a research note June 24.  \u201cFast-moving, bearish macro factors and corresponding\ncentral bank responses are pushing Brent crude fundamentals to\nthe sidelines this summer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe WTI-Brent spread will\ncontinue to tighten on supply-demand and logistics \nfundamentals.\u201d  TransCanada\u2019s Keystone project, facing opposition from\nenvironmental groups and under review by the U.S. State\nDepartment, will be built only if it doesn\u2019t \u201cexacerbate\u201d\n carbon emissions , President  Barack Obama  said yesterday at\n Georgetown University  in  Washington .  Obama\u2019s Stand  \u201cThe net effect of the pipeline\u2019s impact on our climate\nwill be absolutely critical to determining whether this project\nis allowed to go forward,\u201d he said.  Enbridge, the largest transporter of Canadian crude to the\nU.S., shut the Athabasca and Waupisoo systems after finding a\n750-barrel spill on June 22 from Line 37, a link on the\nAthabasca system serving Nexen\u2019s Long Lake oil-sands complex.  The shut lines restricted Suncor\u2019s ability to move product\nout of the region, Chief Executive Officer  Steve Williams  said\nin a statement June 24. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. said\nyesterday that operations are stable.  Nexen is running the Long Lake complex at reduced rates as\nthe company works with Enbridge to determine when repairs on\nLine 37 will be completed, Patti Lewis, a Nexen spokeswoman in\nCalgary, said by e-mail June 24.  Startup Plan  Enbridge will need to submit a startup plan to the Alberta\nEnergy Regulator before returning Line 37 to service, Darin\nBarter, a spokesman for the agency in Calgary, said by e-mail\nyesterday. The company restarted the southern section of the\nAthabasca system from Cheecham to Hardisty late June 23.  Operations on the system north of Cheecham remain down, the\ncompany said yesterday.  Enbridge\u2019s Ozark pipeline from the oil hub of Cushing,\n Oklahoma , to Wood River,  Illinois , has been shut for maintenance\nthat was extended to June 29, mitigating the effect of the\nCanadian constraints on WTI, Lipow said.  \u201cEvery day that the Ozark pipeline is down has a\ncountervailing effect,\u201d he said.  Enbridge said June 24 that it may clear the Waupisoo line\nto  Edmonton  from Cheecham for startup as early as yesterday. The\nLong Lake lateral may be down for an \u201cextended period\u201d because\nof wet conditions, the company said in a statement.  Long Lake  \u201cOther options to support the Long Lake project\u2019s\nrequirements are being evaluated,\u201d Enbridge said.  Western Canada Select strengthened a second day against the\nU.S. benchmark WTI, gaining 25 cents to a discount of $16.50 a\nbarrel yesterday, its highest level in almost a week, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude also advanced 25 cents\nversus WTI yesterday, to a premium of $3.50.  Suncor said it doesn\u2019t expect the temporary output\nreduction to affect annual production. Oil-sands output will\ntotal 350,000 to 380,000 barrels a day this year, with Syncrude\noutput totaling 34,000 to 38,000, the company said April 29.  Flooding in  Alberta  may have affected the integrity of Line\n37,  according to Enbridge. Line 36, which parallels Line 37,\nwas already shut at the time of the leak, Whelan said by e-mail\nJune 22.  Athabasca Line  The 30-inch Athabasca pipeline, also known as Line 19, has\na capacity of 570,000 barrels a day, depending on the viscosity\nof the crude flowing through it, according to the  company\u2019s\nwebsite . The line runs from the Athabasca terminal to the\nHardisty terminal.  The 237-mile (381-kilometer) Waupisoo pipeline, operating\nsince June 2008, runs from Enbridge\u2019s Cheecham terminal to\nEdmonton. The line, also known as Line 18, has an annual\ncapacity of 600,000 barrels a day depending on the viscosity of\nthe crude load, Whelan said.
