 "context": "The following article called 'Japan Exports Fall a Second Month as BOJ Sees Weakness on Europe: Economy' was published on 2011-12-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapan \u2019s exports fell and the central\nbank lowered its assessment of the economy for a second straight\nmonth as weakening demand in Europe and Asia weigh on the\noutlook for global growth.  Shipments  dropped a more-than-expected 4.5 percent in\nNovember from a year earlier, a Ministry of Finance report\nshowed today in Tokyo. The Bank of Japan separately kept its\nasset-buying fund and credit-lending program unchanged, even as\nit said that a pick-up in activity has paused.  \u201cPressure on the BOJ to consider further easing is\nsurging,\u201d said  Naomi Hasegawa , a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ\nMorgan Stanley in Tokyo. \u201cExports are losing steam.\u2019\u201d  Japanese manufacturers are cutting profit and spending\nforecasts as a yen near a postwar record against the dollar\nerodes confidence in the recovery from a March 11 earthquake and\ntsunami. The nation\u2019s credit rating was lowered one step from\nthe top AAA grade by Rating & Investment Information Inc. today,\nciting delays in overhauling social security financing.  The median estimate of 29 economists surveyed by Bloomberg\nNews was for a 4.3 percent decline in exports. In October,\nshipments slid a revised 3.8 percent. The central bank said\ntoday that activity in the world\u2019s third-biggest economy will\n\u201cremain more or less flat for the time being.\u201d  Asset Fund  The central bank kept its asset-buying fund at 20 trillion\nyen ($257 billion), and a credit-lending program at 35 trillion\nyen. The benchmark  interest rate  stayed at a range of zero to\n0.1 percent. The unanimous decisions were in line with\npredictions of all 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Europe\u2019s crisis \u2019\u2019is already starting to affect Japan\u2019s\nexports and production,\u2019\u2019 Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said in Tokyo today. \u201cWe must continue to pay due\nattention to the possibility that the problem will weaken the\ngrowth of the world economy as well as the Japanese economy.\u201d  Shirakawa said it\u2019s hard to specify when the Japanese\neconomy will return to a moderate recovery.  Meantime, Japan\u2019s government left its economic assessment\nunchanged for the second straight month, a Cabinet Office report\nshowed today. It said the economy is slowly picking up from\nMarch\u2019s disaster with businesses exercising caution because of\nthe yen\u2019s appreciation and the European debt crisis.  Japan\u2019s trade deficit widened to 684.7 billion yen in\nNovember from a revised 280.2 billion yen in October, today\u2019s\nfigures showed. Exports to  Asia  fell 8 percent while shipments\nto  China  declined 7.9 percent, according to the Ministry of\nFinance. Overseas sales to the U.S. rose 2 percent in November.  Asian Growth  The figures \u201creflect the weak fundamentals of the Asia\neconomy, especially China,\u201d said  Takuji Okubo , chief Japan\neconomist at Societe Generale Securities in Tokyo. \u201cMomentum in\nAsia is still downward, while the  U.S. economy  seems to have\naccelerated in the fourth quarter.\u201d  Asian stocks rose for a second day, with a benchmark index\npoised for the biggest gain in two weeks, after U.S. housing\nstarts increased more than economists forecast.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 2.1 percent as of 3:25\np.m. in  Hong Kong . The gauge dropped to a three-week low on Dec.\n19 after North Korean leader  Kim Jong Il  died and  Fitch Ratings \nsaid it may cut the credit ratings of European nations.  Other reports in the Asia-Pacific region today showed New\nZealand\u2019s current-account deficit widened as a share of the\neconomy. The shortfall was 4.3 percent of gross domestic product\nin the year ended Sept. 30, from 3.7 percent in the 12 months\nthrough June,  Statistics New Zealand  said in Wellington.  In Europe in the day ahead, a report may show Italy\u2019s\neconomy contracted 0.2 percent in the third quarter from the\nApril-June period and Swedish consumer confidence deteriorated\nthis month, according to median estimates of economists surveyed\nby Bloomberg.  Home Sales  In the U.S., a National Association of Realtors report may\nshow sales of existing homes increased to a 5.05 million annual\nrate in November, a separate survey of forecasts showed, from a\n4.97 million pace a month earlier.  Builders in the U.S. broke ground in November on more\nhouses than at any time in the past 19 months, led by a surge in\nmultifamily units, Commerce Department figures released\nyesterday in  Washington  showed.  Starts increased 9.3 percent to a 685,000 annual rate,\nexceeding the highest estimate of economists surveyed by\nBloomberg News and the most since April 2010.  Japan\u2019s currency is seen by investors as a haven from the\nturmoil in  Europe . The crisis in the euro region, Japan\u2019s third-\nbiggest export market, is \u201cescalating,\u201d  Christine Lagarde , the\nmanaging director of the  International Monetary Fund , said last\nweek.  Yen\u2019s Gains  Fitch Ratings lowered the credit outlook of AAA-rated\nFrance on Dec. 17, citing Europe\u2019s inability to find a\ncomprehensive solution to its debt crisis.  With the Japanese currency close to a postwar high against\nthe dollar, exporters are calling on the government to intervene\nagain in the  currency markets .  The yen touched 100.76 per euro on Oct. 4, the strongest\nsince June 2001 and was at 77.87 to the  U.S. dollar  as of 10:49\na.m. The yen has gained 7.6 percent in the past 12 months\nagainst the U.S. dollar, making it the strongest performer among\nthe Group of 10 currencies for the period.  Nissan\u2019s Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said last\nmonth that Japan\u2019s second-largest carmaker will gradually shift\nproduction overseas to counter the strength of the yen. It\u2019s\n\u201cdifficult to make an investment in a country with no return,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThe yen is a huge handicap for exporters.\u201d  The government said yesterday that Japan will expand funds\nfor currency intervention in its fourth supplementary budget for\nthe current fiscal year. Authorities sold a record amount of yen\nin the month from Oct. 28, Finance Ministry data show.  A central bank report last week indicated Japan\u2019s largest\nmanufacturers were bracing for a slowdown as sentiment fell from\nthree months ago and companies pared their profit and capital\nspending forecasts.
