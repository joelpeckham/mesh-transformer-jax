 "context": "The following article called 'United Vows Steps to Boost Sales as Profit Trails Views' was published on 2013-10-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUnited Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,\nstruggling to match other airlines\u2019 profit gains, said it has\nidentified ways to cut costs by almost $1 billion and shifted\nits biggest planes to different routes to boost revenue.  Shuffling the flights that use Boeing Co. 747 jumbo jets\nwill create a $40 million annual benefit and is among changes to\nrespond to a revenue shortfall that led to third-quarter profit\nmissing analysts\u2019 estimates, United said today.  Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smisek and top managers\noutlined the steps on a conference call after saying quarterly\nsales also trailed estimates. Chicago-based United, which merged\nwith Continental Airlines in 2010, said it\u2019s making changes to a\nrevenue management system that sold too many seats at lower\nfares and set a goal of capping increases in a benchmark expense\ngauge at the inflation rate.  \u201cUnited has not just been going the wrong way profit-wise,\nit seems to have squandered so far the promising potential that\nhad seemed so obvious\u201d with the 2010 merger that combined the\nnetworks of United and Continental Airlines, Vicki Bryan, a\nsenior bond analyst at New York-based Gimme Credit LLC, said in\na note.  The  shares  rose 1.1 percent to $31.30 at the close in New\nYork. While United has rallied 34 percent this year, that\u2019s only\nthe seventh-biggest gain among the 10 carriers in the Bloomberg\nU.S. Airlines Index.  \u2018Too High\u2019  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that our costs are too high,\u201d Smisek\nsaid on the call. \u201cWe have significant opportunities to run a\nquality operation with quality customer service and be far more\nefficient than we are today.\u201d  Chief Financial Officer John Rainey set the cost-cutting\nopportunities at about $1 billion, while declining to commit to\nthat figure as a goal. He said United wanted to wait \u201cuntil we\ncan provide some specificity\u201d to investors next month.  United said it\u2019s making changes to a revenue management\nsystem that led to selling too many low fares for too long,\nresulting in more seats filled per plane but at reduced rates.\nFurther changes will occur next month to reflect recent demand\ntrends, Chief Revenue Officer Jim Compton said. Those tweaks\nwon\u2019t have a full effect until 2014\u2019s first half, he said.  Sales rose 3.2 percent to $10.2 billion, missing the $10.3\nbillion average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nProfit excluding some costs was $1.51 a share, United said. That\nfell short of the $1.55 average estimate.  China Competition  United, the biggest U.S. carrier on flights to  China , also\nsaw revenue falter as competitors added service to the world\u2019s\nmost populous country. Passenger revenue in the Pacific region\ndropped 11 percent, United said, after telling investors last\nmonth that an increase in industrywide seating capacity to China\nwas eroding fares.  The carrier\u2019s performance contrasted with revenue gains at\nDelta Air Lines Inc., AMR Corp.\u2019s American Airlines and US\nAirways Group Inc., each of which reported record sales.  \u201cClearly they are not performing as well, haven\u2019t\nperformed as well, as the rest of the industry,\u201d Bob McAdoo, an\nImperial Capital LLC analyst in Los Angeles, said in an\ninterview. He rates the stock outperform.  Passenger traffic on United\u2019s main jet fleet fell 0.3\npercent as the average fare per mile rose 0.8 percent. Revenue\nfor each seat flown a mile increased 1.6 percent, while costs on\nthe same basis and excluding special items rose 5 percent.  Pacific Decline  United\u2019s Pacific region was the only one at the airline\nwith declines last quarter in industry benchmarks such as\nrevenue for each seat flown a mile and the average fare for each\nmile flown, according to today\u2019s statement. The airline faces\nnew service on China-U.S. flights this year from Delta,  China\nEastern Airlines Corp. (670)  and  Air China Ltd. (601111)   \u201cAdvance booked seat factor,\u201d a measure of future demand,\nis down 3.3 percentage points on flights across the Pacific over\nthe next six weeks compared with a year earlier, United said\ntoday. That gauge is up 0.5 point for trans-Atlantic flights and\n0.6 point for service to Latin America, United said.  United\u2019s  net income  rose to $379 million, or 98 cents a\nshare, including $211 million in costs for merger integration\nand lump sum cash payments under a tentative labor agreement.\nThat increased from $6 million, or 2 cents, a year earlier, when\n$514 million in special charges were recorded.  Today\u2019s release made United the last of the five largest\nU.S. airlines to announce quarterly results. Southwest Airlines\nCo., the only other carrier in that group that reported today,\nposted a profit that matched analysts\u2019 estimates.  Alaska Air\nGroup Inc. (ALK) \u2019s adjusted profit beat estimates on that basis.
