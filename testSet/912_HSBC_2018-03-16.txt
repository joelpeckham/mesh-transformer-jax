 "context": "The following article called 'HSBC pay gap, Rihanna Snap, Skimm investment: Broadsheet March 16 | Fortune' was published on 2018-03-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBy Kristen Bellstrom 7:18 AM EDT\nGood morning, Broadsheet readers! Rihanna may have sunk Snap stock, The Skimm\u2019s bank account gets fatter, and yet another U.K. bank is paying women less than men. Have a rejuvenating weekend.\nEVERYONE'S TALKING\n\u2022 Mind HSBC\u2019s gap . Remember when I wrote about Barclays and the data that shows that it\u2019s paying its female investment bankers just under half what it pays their male counterparts (on average)? Well, the pay gap plot thickens.\nHSBC, the UK\u2019s largest bank, just published its wage data, revealing that it pays women a full 59% less than men, on average, according to the difference in hourly pay in 2017. The numbers are specific to HSBC Bank, which employs more than 23,500 people.\nThe bank blames the gap on the fact that women hold only 23% of HSBC\u2019s senior leadership roles (i.e. the ones with the largest salaries), arguing, as Quartz puts it, \u201cthat equal pay isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s the distribution of women in the company\u2019s hierarchy.\u201d\nObviously, it\u2019s important that women at the bank (and everywhere!) are receiving equal pay for equal work, and it\u2019s frustrating that this particular data dump doesn\u2019t allow us to compare the salaries of men and women in equivalent jobs. That said, the fact that the bank has so few women in top roles isn\u2019t exactly something to tout. On a macro scale, it\u2019s impossible to separate the issues of pay equity and women\u2019s representation in leadership. Until we achieve both, women won\u2019t have achieved real workplace equality.\nQuartz\nAdvertisement ALSO IN THE HEADLINES\n\u2022 Ri-Ri\u2019s revenge . Rihanna responded to Snap\u2019s decision to run an ad that asked users to decide whether they wanted to slap her or punch Chris Brown, saying it made a joke of her history as a victim of domestic violence: \u201cShame on you.\u201d (Snapchat has removed the ad and apologized). I bet you can guess what happened next: The company\u2019s stock fell almost 5%.\nFortune\n\u2022 Skimming the news . The Skimm, led by co-founders Carly Zakin and Danielle Weisberg, have raised a $12 million round of funding, led by Google Ventures and Spanx founder Sara Blakely. Recode reports that the pair were looking for a $100 million valuation (their last round, in September 2016, valued the company at about $55 million), but the company has not commented on its current valuation.\nRecode\n\u2022 Slow down, Sorkin . Harper Lee\u2019s estate is suing the producers of the forthcoming Broadway adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird , charging that the Aaron Sorkin script violates a contract that stipulates that the characters and plot must remain faithful to the spirit of the book.\nNew York Times\n\u2022 On-set offenses . HuffPo spoke to nearly 20 women who work in \u201cbehind-the-camera\u201d jobs (think production assistants, cinematographers, set dressers) for this expose of the rampant sexual harassment and discrimination that takes place in the film industry.\nHuffington Post\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT\n\u2022 Studying up . When parsing the gender pay gap, it often comes up that women are more likely to study subjects that correspond with lower-paying jobs than men are. Yet this Bloomberg graphic illustrates how \u201ceven in traditionally pre-professional fields, such as business, science and economics, equal educational attainment doesn\u2019t always correspond to similar career choices by men and women.\u201d\nBloomberg\n\u2022 Her song suit . Miley Cyrus faces a $300 million lawsuit over her 2013 hit \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop,\u201d after Jamaican artist Michael May filed a copyright complaint alleging that it borrows lyrics from his 1988 reggae track \u201cWe Run Things.\u201d\nFortune\n\u2022 A turbulent claim .
