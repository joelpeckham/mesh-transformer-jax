 "context": "The following article called 'Ringgit Rises for a Third Day After Fed Signals Further Stimulus' was published on 2012-03-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMalaysia\u2019s ringgit climbed for a\nthird day, the longest winning streak since February, after the\n Federal Reserve  said monetary stimulus is still needed to\nsustain a recovery in the world\u2019s largest economy. Bonds gained.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific  Index (MXAP)  of stocks rose the most in more\nthan three months after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said\nyesterday that while he is encouraged by a decline in the U.S.\nunemployment rate, continued accommodative measures will be\nneeded to make progress.  The ringgit advanced 0.6 percent to 3.0570 per dollar as of\n4:09 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. It has strengthened 3.8 percent this quarter, the\nsecond-best performance among Asia\u2019s 11 most-used currencies.  \u201cBernanke\u2019s statement encourages investors to search for\nhigher-yielding assets,\u201d said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at\nRAM Holdings Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . \u201cWe expect the ringgit to\nstrengthen to 2.900 to the dollar by the end of 2012, although\nthe path may be choppy.\u201d  The ringgit\u2019s one-month implied volatility, a measure of\nexchange-rate swings used to price options, slumped 22 basis\npoints to 7.38 percent.  Malaysia\u2019s gross domestic product will rise at a slower\npace this year as financial and economic restructuring in\ndeveloped nations curb global growth, the central bank said last\nweek. The economy will expand 4 percent to 5 percent in 2012, it\nsaid. That is less than the  Finance Ministry \u2019s 5 percent-to-6\npercent forecast in October, and a 5.1 percent pace in 2011.  Five-year  government bonds  advanced. The yield on the 4.262\npercent notes due September 2016 fell one basis point, or 0.01\npercentage point, to 3.30 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.
