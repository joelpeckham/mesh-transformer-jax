The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRIO DE JANEIRO (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A land rights activist and descendant of slaves has been shot dead in Brazil\u2019s Amazon, authorities said, raising concerns of increased violence tied to property disputes.\nNazildo dos Santos Brito, 33, was killed on Saturday night in the remote rural area of Tome-A\u00e7u, civil police in the northern Para state said in a statement.\nBrito was a quilombola, as slave descendants are known, and the subject of lawsuits filed by palm oil company Biopalma da Amazonia SA, a subsidiary of giant mining company Vale.\nThe company accused him of disturbance, invasion, threats and other crimes, according to local news website Amazonia Real.\nIn an email, Biopalma said its activity always complies with the law and human rights and that it \u201cprioritized dialogue with communities.\u201d\nThe company said it filed a single lawsuit, in 2015, to investigate the invasion of its property in Para state that involved members of quilombolas and indigenous communities.\nBrito\u2019s motorcycle was not taken when he was slain, likely evidence that he was killed not in a robbery but for his activism in the Amazon region, rights groups said.\n\u201cEverything indicates that it was an execution. He was a \u2018marked\u2019 guy,\u201d said Ruben Siqueira, a member of the Pastoral Land Commission, set up by the Catholic Church to combat violence against the rural poor.\nWhen huge business interests are at stake and activists speak out, \u201cthey are eliminated,\u201d Siqueira told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBrito had been head of a community association of quilombolas and farmers, police said.\nAmazonia Real and local activists in Para state said Brito had sought to join a witness protection program.\nSouth America\u2019s largest country, Brazil is rich in land ripe for development and low on deeds and property records, leading to enormous tension and conflict over rights.\nIt was the world\u2019s most dangerous nation for land rights activists in 2016, with about 50 people killed, according to London-based Global Witness.\nThe Pastoral Land Commission says there were 70 murders in the Brazilian countryside in 2017,the most since 2003. Para state, where Brito was killed, led with 21 of the murders.\nHowever, the rights group estimates the number of killings is actually higher but many cases go unreported.\nFundacao Cultural Palmares, a government body that promotes Afro-Brazilian culture, said it \u201csees with apprehension the escalation of violence in the country\u2019s conflict areas.\u201d\n\u201cIn a democratic nation, one can not admit in any way the use of brutality as a substitute for dialogue,\u201d it said in a statement.\nReporting by Karla Mendes; Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women\u2019s rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
