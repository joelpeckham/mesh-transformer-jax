(JPM)  lost a bid to\nhave a U.S. judge dismiss lawsuits filed by the  Federal Housing\nFinance Agency  against 16 U.S. banks over mortgage-backed\nsecurities.  JPMorgan,  Bank of America Corp.  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  were\namong the lenders sued last year for allegedly misleading Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac about the soundness of loans underlying\nbillions of dollars of residential mortgage-backed securities.\nJPMorgan served as the lead underwriter for 30 out of the 103\nsecuritizations at issue in this case.  U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in  Manhattan  today rejected\na bid to throw out the FHFA\u2019s complaint, overruling arguments\nthat the agency lacked factual support that the loans underlying\nthe securitizations weren\u2019t underwritten in accordance with the\nguidelines set out in the offering documents.  \u201cThe agency\u2019s reliance on this information is not, as the\ndefendants allege, an effort to argue \u2018fraud by hindsight\u2019;\nrather the amended complaint suggests that these market events\nare telltale signs of defects that were present in the\nsecuritizations all along, albeit, unbeknownst to the public,\u201d\nthe judge wrote.  \u201cFHFA may be wrong of course; a jury will decide,\u201d Cote\nsaid. \u201cBut the claim is not an implausible one.\u201d  \u2018Total Collapse\u2019  Cote said that the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaints includes\nallegations of a \u201ctotal collapse in credit ratings\u201d and claims\nthe banks had made false statements of material facts in\nregistration statements, which \u201cdirectly caused  Fannie Mae  and\nFreddie Mac to suffer billions of dollars in damages.\u201d The\nplaintiffs also claim the loans underlying the securities\nexperienced defaults and delinquencies at a much higher rate\nthan they would have if the loan originators had adhered to\nunderwriting guidelines.  Cote cited evidence provided by the plaintiffs in the\namended complaint that included statements or two \u201cconfidential\nwitnesses\u201d who were personally involved in the origination and\nunderwriting of JPMorgan\u2019s EMC unit.  She also said the plaintiffs included testimony from\nwitnesses who described being pressured by supervisors to\napprove loans in disregard of their expressed concerns about\npotentially fraudulent documentation and cited other evidence\nprovided by plaintiffs involving Washington Mutual Inc.  \u2018Wild West\u2019  \u201cAs one appraiser who did business with WaMu during the\nrelevant period described the bank\u2019s origination practices: \u2018It\nwas the Wild West ... if you were alive, they would give you a\nloan, Actually, I think if you were dead, they would still give\nyou a loan,\u2019\u201d Cote said in her ruling, citing the witness\u2019s\nstatements.  WaMu, based in  Seattle , filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 26,\n2008, the day after its banking unit was taken over by\nregulators and sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co. for $1.9 billion.  The defendants argued the plaintiffs had failed to provide\nsufficient evidence to support their claims.  Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  have operated under U.S.\nconservatorship since 2008, when they were seized amid subprime\nmortgage losses that pushed them toward insolvency.  Cote did narrow the case, dismissing some claims alleging\nviolations of the Virginia Securities Act as well as fraud\nclaims regarding the owner-occupancy and loan-to-value ratio of\nthe securities for which New York-based JPMorgan served as lead\nunderwriter.  Amended Complaint  She cited the amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs,\nincluding statements made by JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer\n Jamie Dimon  criticizing the quality of loans originated by Chase\nHome Finance LLC, a unit of the bank. The judge said the amended\ncomplaint also mentioned the $5.3 billion settlement JPMorgan\nreached this year with state and local authorities.  Joe Evangelisti , a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to\ncomment on the ruling.  Also sued by the FHFA were  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Nomura Holdings\nInc. (8604) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Societe Generale SA (GLE) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,\n Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) ,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,  Credit\nSuisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and  First Horizon National\nCorp. (FHN)   The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. JPMorgan\nChase & Co., 11-CV-6188, U.S. District court, Southern District\nof  New York  (Manhattan).
