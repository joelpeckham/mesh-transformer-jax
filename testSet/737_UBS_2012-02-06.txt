The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Alameda County Employees\u2019\nRetirement Association asked a judge to certify a class-action\nlawsuit against  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. \u2019s former auditor\nErnst & Young LLP over investment losses.  The retirement system is seeking to lead the group suit on\nbehalf of investors who lost money on bankrupt Lehman\u2019s common\nstock and options, it said in a court filing. Ernst & Young\nhelped to mislead investors by making false and misleading\nstatements in regulatory reports about Lehman\u2019s finances before\nits 2008 bankruptcy, the retirement system alleged in the Feb. 3\nfiling.  The investors originally sued Lehman, former executives\nincluding ex-Chief Executive Officer Richard Fuld and\nunderwriters, adding Ernst & Young as a defendant in 2010. Since\nthen, they have settled with many defendants -- Fuld and other\nLehman executives used a $90 million insurance payment to pay\nfor the accord -- while continuing to litigate against Ernst &\nYoung and a UBS AG unit that sold Lehman structured products,\naccording to the filing.  Charlie Perkins, an Ernst & Young spokesman, declined to\ncomment on the Oakland, California, retirement system\u2019s filing.\nThe auditing firm has said its work for Lehman met all\napplicable professional standards and applied rules that existed\nat the time. It also is fighting a lawsuit over Lehman\u2019s\ncollapse by the  New York  attorney general.  Alameda County and other pension funds amended their\nlawsuit in 2010 to add findings contained in a 2,200-page report\npublished by Lehman bankruptcy examiner Anton Valukus.  According to Valukas, Lehman used balance-sheet devices\nsuch as so-called Repo 105 transactions to make its debt load\nlook lighter than it was.  Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 with\n$639 billion in assets. It has said it will spend the next few\nyears completing a liquidation to pay unsecured creditors less\nthan 18 cents on the dollar.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Equity/Debt Securities\nLitigation, 08-cv-05523, U.S. District Court, Southern District\nof New York ( Manhattan ).
