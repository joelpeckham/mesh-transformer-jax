 "context": "The following article called 'Dundee Shows REIT No Haven as Bond Yields Rise' was published on 2013-06-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDundee Real Estate Investment Trust (D-U) \nand  Calloway REIT (CWT-U)  are bearing the brunt of a rout among real\nestate, utility and telecommunications shares as rising bond\nyields reduce demand for high-dividend stocks.  Dundee and Calloway are the two worst-performing REITs this\nyear through yesterday among 14 stocks in the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s/TSX Capped REIT Index. The index has slid 8.5 percent\nsince reaching a record high on April 30, three days before a\nstronger-than-expected U.S. jobs report sparked a rise in bond\nyields and speculation the  Federal Reserve  may begin to slow\nmonetary stimulus. The index dropped seven straight days through\nJune 5, the longest skid in three years.  \u201cIf you can get a guaranteed return of 4 percent versus a\nriskier stock paying a similar yield, obviously you\u2019ll see a\ntransition,\u201d  Michael Gregory , Toronto-based senior economist\nwith BMO Capital Markets, said in a phone interview on June 5.\n\u201cFor those who moved into dividends as a substitute for fixed\nincome, as rates begin to rise you\u2019ll see flows back into the\n bond market .\u201d  Dividends have provided some relief for investors in\nCanadian stocks, which are on track for their third year of\nunderperformance against U.S. stocks. The broad S&P/TSX\nComposite index has risen 6.7 percent in the last 12 months, the\nworst performance among 24 developed markets tracked by\nBloomberg. With dividends included, that return rises to 10\npercent.  Vincent Delisle, investment strategist with Scotia Capital\nInc.\u2019s portfolio strategy group in  Montreal , said the dividend\ntrade and hunt for yields is at an end.  \u2018Head Fakes\u2019  \u201cCyclicals will benefit from a rotation out of dividend-paying sectors,\u201d Delisle said in a phone interview on June 5.\nHigh-yielding dividend stocks are \u201cthe priciest ones, they\u2019re\nall trading at premiums,\u201d he said.  Telecommunications  and utilities have been the two worst-performing industries in the S&P/TSX in the past month, slumping\n4 percent and 7.1 percent respectively.  These industries have been dragged down by weakness among\ncompanies including  Canadian Utilities Ltd. (CU) , down 9.1 percent,\nand  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) , down 7.2 percent in that period.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had head fakes in 2010, 2011 and 2012 but this year\nbond yields are turning and the upside is for real,\u201d Delisle\nsaid.  Canadian 10-year government bond  yields  have risen 37 basis\npoints to 2.04 percent since May 2, while yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury  note  have jumped 45 basis points to 2.08 percent\nyesterday.  \u2018Step Down\u2019  Ten-year U.S. yields will rise to 2.4 percent by the end of\nthe year and increase to 4 percent at the end of 2014, levels\nnot seen since 2008, Gregory estimates.  Yields on 30-year bonds jumped the most in seven months on\nMay 3 after a government report showed the  U.S. economy  created\n165,000 jobs in April, compared with economist forecasts of\n140,000 in a Bloomberg survey, and the previous month\u2019s tally\nwas revised higher.  They continued to rise after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke \nsaid May 22 the central bank could \u201ctake a step down in our\npace of purchases\u201d of Treasuries and mortgage debt it buys\nwithin \u201cthe next few meetings.\u201d The Fed has been buying $85\nbillion in debt a month this year to keep yields low and foster\ninvestment in the U.S.  The Fed has pledged to maintain record-low borrowing costs\nas long as the jobless rate remains above 6.5 percent and the\noutlook for inflation doesn\u2019t exceed 2.5 percent.  Energy Attractive  \u201cAbsent continued disinflation and external shocks, we\nthink the path of least resistance for bond yields will be a\nslight increase to 2.7 percent by year-end,\u201d  Stefane Marion ,\nchief economist and strategist with National Bank Financial,\nsaid in a report June 4, referring to the U.S. 10-year yield.\nMarion changed his  asset allocation , lowering utilities,\ntelecommunications and staples stocks to underweight and energy\nstocks to overweight.  \u201cWe believe that earnings of Canadian energy producers\nwill find support from the recent depreciation of the Canadian\ndollar,\u201d Marion said. The Canadian dollar declined to C$1.03\nper U.S. dollar yesterday from around parity on May 8.  REITs receive preferential tax treatment from the\ngovernment and invest in income-producing real estate, such as\nshopping malls and nursing homes, and pay out most of their\nearnings to investors through unit distributions.  Still Borrowing  The REIT index rose 0.5 percent for a yield of 5.23 percent\nat 4 p.m. in Toronto today after  Canada  posted the biggest jobs\ngain in a decade and U.S. employment rose more than analysts\nestimated.  Michael Cooper, chief executive officer of Dundee REIT,\nsaid the rise in market interest rates is not affecting\nbusiness.  \u201cWe\u2019re able to borrow lots of money at very low rates,\u201d\nCooper said in a phone interview from Toronto today. \u201cI wish\nthe stock was doing better. We have lots of good days, and we\nhave some days that aren\u2019t as good. But the integrity of the\nbusiness is in great shape.\u201d  Calloway interim Chief Executive Officer Huw Thomas said\nthe company is stable and the rising yield environment has not\nhad any impact on their retail tenants.  \u201cWe have to manage for the long-term,\u201d Thomas said in a\nphone interview today. \u201cI\u2019ve met with a number of unit holders,\nand we talked about the market in general and they see all REITs\nare down. If Calloway was down substantially and the rest were\nflat, I\u2019d get many more calls.\u201d  REIT Spinoffs  Brian Huen, managing partner with Red Sky Capital\nManagement Ltd. in Toronto, said established REITs are too\nexpensive, and would rather own them indirectly through holdings\ncompanies such as  Dundee Corp. (DC/A)  or a retailer like Canadian Tire\nCorp., which is planning to spin off its real estate holdings\ninto a REIT. Loblaw Cos. is also crafting a REIT from its retail\nproperties.  In such a case, investors will get a boost from real estate\nholdings that were undervalued while held within a company\u2019s\nbalance sheet, he said.  \u201cThe valuation arbitrage exists and the window of\nopportunity is now,\u201d Huen said in an interview by phone June 3.\nHis firm manages about C$220 million ($216 million). \u201cYou don\u2019t\nwant to do it when values are low. The window of opportunity is\nprobably for the next six months to a year. You\u2019re still seeing\nlots of interest in REITs.\u201d  Want Yield    Companies have raised $782.8 million from six Canadian\ninitial public offerings this year, including Milestone\nApartments REIT and Agellan Commercial REIT, to account for 58\npercent of the $1.36 billion raised from initial offerings, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show.  Companies raised almost $500 million in seven REIT IPOs\nlast year, more than any other industry in Canada, the data\nshow.  \u201cRetail and institutional investors are trying to figure\nout a solution to a problem -- they want to lend against a real\nasset and get yield for it,\u201d Eric Bushell, chief investment\nofficer with CI Investments Inc., said in a phone interview from\nToronto. He manages C$40 billion for Signature Global Asset\nManagement.  \u201cThat\u2019s why you have companies like Loblaw\u2019s and now\nCanadian Tire spinning out their real estate. They\u2019re\nrestructuring, which is exactly what we did during the income\ntrust cycle. The risk is a \u2019herding\u2019 behavior -- investors are\nleft with no option but to pursue this strategy.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nEric Lam in Toronto at \n elam87@bloomberg.net ;\nKatia Dmitrieva in Toronto at \n edmitrieva1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nDavid Scanlan at \n dscanlan@bloomberg.net ;\nLynn Thomasson at \n lthomasson@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was 42.61884689331055 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was ",
