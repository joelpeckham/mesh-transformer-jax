 "context": "The following article called 'Meat-Inspector Furloughs Seen by USDA as Several Months Away' was published on 2013-03-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFurloughs of inspectors at\nmeatpacking plants under mandated U.S. budget cuts will take\n\u201cseveral months\u201d to implement as workers have to be notified\nahead of time, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture is sending out notices\nto union representatives this week that furloughs are possible,\nVilsack said today at a hearing of the House Agriculture\nCommittee. Meatpacking plants can\u2019t operate without a USDA\ninspector present, so keeping facilities open will be a\nchallenge, he said.  \u201cWe will do everything we can to minimize the\ndisruption,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are looking at a several-month\nperiod before furloughs can be implemented.\u201d  About $85 billion in federal spending cuts for this fiscal\nyear began taking effect March 1 under so-called sequestration,\na budget mechanism stemming from failed deficit-reduction\nnegotiations. Democratic and Republican leaders have indicated\nthey would revisit the reductions after they pass legislation\nneeded to keep the government running beyond March 27. A Senate\nplan to avert sequestration partly by ending about $5 billion in\nannual farm subsidies failed to receive a vote last week.  Furlough Forecasts  Slaughterhouses operated by  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield\nFoods Inc. (SFD)  may shut for as many as 15 days after meat inspectors\nare sent home without pay, and weather forecasts important to\nfarmers could be compromised by idled meteorologists at the\nNational Weather Service, the government has said. Tyson and\nCargill Inc., two of the largest U.S. meat processors, said last\nweek they don\u2019t expect furloughs of meat inspectors to occur\nbefore at least April.  Vilsack said that the latest calculations of what the USDA\nneeds to save indicate \u201cthe furlough days may be in the\nneighborhood of 11 to 12 days\u201d and that the mandated days off\nwithout pay will be staggered.  Predictions that meatpacking plants will need to close as\ninspectors are furloughed are roiling commodity prices,\ncommittee Chairman Frank Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican, told\nVilsack, questioning whether the disruptions predicted by the\nadministration of President  Barack Obama  will be as dire as\nportrayed.  \u201cMembers of this committee have heard from constituents\nthat these statements about the interruption of production have\naffected prices, caused concern among financial markets, and\nalarmed buyers and sellers in the retail and food-service\ncommunity,\u201d Lucas said.  Meat, poultry and egg processors are prohibited from\noperating without the presence of federal inspectors. A 15-day\nfurlough may cost the industry more than $10 billion in\nproduction losses and workers may lose more than $400 million in\nwages, Vilsack said in a Feb. 5 letter to Senate Appropriations\nCommittee Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski.  The USDA is responsible for the safety of meat, eggs and\npoultry products, with about 8,400 personnel inspecting the\nnation\u2019s 6,300 slaughterhouses and processing plants. The U.S.\nFood and Drug Administration handles other products that account\nfor about 80 percent of the U.S. food supply.  Each year, contaminated food kills about 3,000 people and\nsends another 128,000 to hospitals, according to the U.S.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.
