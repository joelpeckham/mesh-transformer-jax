The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLegend International Holdings Inc., \nbacked by Soros Fund Management LLC, will next week approach\nbuyers for part of its Australian phosphate project that\u2019s worth\nas much as $1 billion, according to a person with knowledge of\nthe matter.  The Melbourne-based company will ask for preliminary bids\nin early January, said the person who declined to be identified\nbecause the details are private. Legend International hired\n Nomura Holdings Inc.  to advise on strategic transactions for the\ndeposits in the Georgina Basin in Queensland state, according to\n a Dec. 2 statement.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a strategic partner who has expertise\nin phosphate fertilizers and also has the financial muscle to\nassist us in building an $800 million plant,\u201d Chief Executive\nOfficer  Joseph Gutnick  said in an interview, without giving a\ntimeframe. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to put a value until we get into\nproduction or we export phosphate rocks. I wouldn\u2019t like to\nguess a figure at this stage.\u201d  The company is planning to build a plant that will start\noutput in 2013 at an annual rate of 1.8 million metric tons of\nnutrient fertilizers a year, it said in the statement. Demand\nfor fertilizers is rising as shrinking arable land and rising\nworld food demand spurs consumption and takeovers.  Legend International\u2019s phosphate deposits may be valued at\nbetween $500 million to $1 billion, the person said. The company\nowns total mineral deposits of 1.2 billion tons near the city of\nMount Isa, according to its  website.   Asian Buyers  The company will approach potential partners in China,\nKorea, Japan, India and Southeast Asia, Gutnick said. He hasn\u2019t\ndecided whether to sell a majority or minority stake as that\nwill depend on the partner who may choose to take out a loan or\ninvest in the project, Gutnick said.  Anne Lui , a Hong Kong spokeswoman at Nomura, declined to\ncomment.  World food prices climbed for a fifth month in November,\nrising to the highest level in more than two years, according to\nthe United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization. The FAO\u2019s\nindex of 55 food commodities jumped to 205.4 points, the highest\nlevel since July 2008, the Rome-based agency said in a monthly\nreport on Dec. 1.  Soros Fund Management LLC owns 10.4 percent of the company,\nAtticus Capital LP, a New York-based hedge fund, owns 13.5\npercent, according to Legend\u2019s website.  Takeovers  Legend\u2019s phosphate and mining business consists of three\nphosphate deposits in Mount Isa in the Georgina Basin. The\ncompany proposes developing the project in two stages, including\na phosphate fertilizer complex and a beneficiation plant that\nwill be used to upgrade phosphate ores mined, the statement said.  \u201cThe outlook for global phosphate demand and prices is\nvery attractive on the back of the growth in global food demand,\nincreasing importance of food security and emergence of\nphosphate fertilizer as a key ingredient in enhancing food\nsupply,\u201d said  Sheryar Chishty, global head of industrials\ninvestment banking at Nomura, in the statement.  K+S AG, Europe\u2019s largest potash producer, agreed to buy\nCanada\u2019s Potash One Inc. for C$434 million ($427 million) in\nNovember, the same month that BHP Billiton Ltd. abandoned its\n$40 billion bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. after\nCanada\u2019s government objected.
