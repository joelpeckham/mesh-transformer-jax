 "context": "The following article called 'Oracle Buys Involver to Expand in Social-Media Tools' was published on 2012-07-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOracle Corp. (ORCL) , the world\u2019s largest\nmaker of  database software , is buying Involver Inc., the third\nacquisition in two months aimed at helping customers use social-\nmedia tools to market wares and run their businesses.  Closely held Involver makes software tools that let\ncompanies interact with customers on Facebook Inc. and Twitter\nInc.\u2019s social-networking services. Its products also let\nmarketers create Facebook pages to represent their brands.  Chief Executive Officer  Larry Ellison  is using  dealmaking \nto step up rivalry with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) \nin the market for social-media management tools, which may more\nthan double to $970 million in 2016 from $389 million this year,\naccording to Forrester Research Inc.  \u201cEverything\u2019s becoming more integrated overall, whether\nit\u2019s customer-relationship management, advertising or\nanalytics,\u201d said Kimberly Maul, an analyst at market researcher\nEMarketer Inc. \u201cBrands want to be able to do all of that\ntogether.\u201d  Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed. Shares of Oracle were\nlittle changed, slipping less than 1 percent to $29.05 at the\nclose in  New York . The stock is up 13 percent this year.  More Collaboration  The rise of social media ads, such as sponsored stories on\nFacebook and promoted tweets on Twitter, means workers who\ncreate websites, write ad copy and manage customer relationships\nneed to collaborate more, Maul said.  That\u2019s spurring acquisitions by Oracle and Salesforce,\nwhich sell a range of sales, marketing and customer-service\nsoftware. Oracle said in May that it is buying Vitrue Inc.,\nwhich helps companies run marketing campaigns on Facebook and\nTwitter. It announced plans the following month to buy\nCollective Intellect Inc., which analyzes user data culled from\nwebsites.  Customers  of Involver include Best Buy Co., Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\nInc. and Viacom Inc.\u2019s MTV Networks, according to Involver\u2019s\nwebsite.  Salesforce said on June 4 that it would  pay $689 million \nfor Buddy Media Inc., which helps companies create social-media\ncampaigns. Weeks later, Microsoft agreed to pay $1.2 billion for\nYammer Inc., a maker of software that lets employees collaborate\nin the workplace.  Marketing Automation  The kind of software Involver, Buddy Media and other\nsocial-marketing companies make is especially attractive to\nstartups that want to invest more in acquiring customers online\nthan hiring lots of sales staff, said  Rick Sherlund , an analyst\nat Nomura Holdings Inc. in New York.  \u201cA lot of young companies need to invest maybe more in\nmarketing automation than they do in sales-force automation,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThis is a new wave of marketing and it\u2019s becoming a\nvery strategic area.\u201d  Deals by Oracle and Salesforce may put more pressure on  SAP\nAG (SAP) , the largest maker of business applications, to acquire\ncompanies in the social-marketing area.  \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll engage,\u201d said Sherlund, who has \u201cbuy\u201d\nratings on Oracle and SAP. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to be active here as\nwell.\u201d Jive Software Inc., which went public in December, could\nbe a possible acquisition target, he said.  So could closely held Wildfire Interactive Inc. and Hearsay\nSocial Inc., which makes dashboards for monitoring workers\u2019\nactivities on Facebook, Twitter and other sites, said\nEMarketer\u2019s Maul.
