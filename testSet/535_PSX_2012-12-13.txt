 "context": "The following article called 'Phillips 66 Plans to Raise $400 Million in 2013 Pipeline IPO' was published on 2012-12-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPhillips 66 (PSX) , the crude refiner that\nwas spun off from ConocoPhillips in May, plans to raise as much\nas $400 million in an initial public offering next year for a\nminority interest in some of its pipeline and logistics assets.  Phillips 66 plans to hold the IPO in the second half of\n2013 for units in a master-limited partnership, or MLP, and use\nthe proceeds to pay for expansion of its oil and natural gas\ntransportation operations, the Houston-based company said today\nin a statement.  \u201cWe believe the proposed MLP will enable us to enhance our\nvalue for our shareholders and increase the transparency of our\nbusiness,\u201d Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Greg Garland\nsaid in the statement, which comes as Phillips 66 today holds\nits first meeting for analysts and investors in  New York .  Phillips 66 would become the fourth refiner since 2011 to\ncreate or announce plans for a pipeline-related MLP. MLPs, which\nare usually controlled by a general partner, pay no corporate\nincome tax. They pay most of their cash to owners of limited\npartnership units, which are traded like shares in a public\ncorporation. The partnership owners become responsible for\npaying taxes individually. The company did not disclose which\nassets it plans to use to create the MLP.  \u201cRefiners are subject at the end of the day to commodity\nrisk,\u201d  Gianna Bern , president of risk-management consultant\nBrookshire Advisory & Research, Inc. in  Chicago , said in a\ntelephone interview today. \u201cPutting in place a structure that\nprovides a stable investment return would be viewed positively\namongst investors.\u201d  Creating MLPs  Refiners have embraced the model as a way to reap more\nvalue from pipeline assets for which investors will pay a\npremium.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC) , which was spun off from\nMarathon Oil Corp. last year, sold 17.3 million units in MPLX LP\non Oct. 25, creating an MLP valued at $2.3 billion, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg.  The companies have used the creation of MLPs, share\nbuybacks and dividend increases to lessen earnings volatility\ninherent in refining and draw investors including  Warren\nBuffett \u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and BlackRock Inc. As of Sept.\n30, Berkshire was one of the largest  shareholders  of Phillips\n66, with 27.2 million shares, or 4.3 percent of the company.\nBlackRock  disclosed  Dec. 6 that it holds a 10 percent stake in\nMarathon Petroleum.  Other Sectors  Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum have sought a niche as\nrefiners with growing operations in other energy sectors.\nMarathon Petroleum plans to grow its pipeline business through\nnew projects tied to its refining operations and acquisitions,\nGarry Peiffer, president of MPLX LP, said Dec. 11 in a telephone\ninterview.  Phillips 66, which has stakes in 15 operating refineries, a\nchemical joint venture with Chevron Corp. and a pipeline and\nnatural gas liquids  unit  with Spectra Energy Corp., plans $3.7\nbillion in 2013  capital spending , a 6 percent increase over this\nyear\u2019s estimated total, according to the statement.  About $1.8 billion of that represents Phillips 66\u2019s\ncontribution toward spending by its chemical and pipeline joint\nventures for new infrastructure projects, natural gas liquids\nproduction and a petrochemical plant.  Phillips 66, which has 14 buy and seven hold ratings from\nanalysts, has  risen  62 percent since its first day of official\ntrading May 1. The shares rose less than 1 percent to $53.05 at\nthe close yesterday in New York.  Tesoro Corp., Marathon Petroleum and Delek U.S. Holdings\nhave already formed pipeline MLPs.
