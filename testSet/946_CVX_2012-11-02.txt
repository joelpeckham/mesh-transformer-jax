(CVX) , the second-biggest\nU.S. energy company by market value, said third-quarter profit\ndeclined as output plunged to a 4-year low,  oil prices  slumped\nand refining income dropped 65 percent.  Net income was $5.25 billion, or $2.69 a share, compared\nwith $7.83 billion, or $3.92, a year earlier,  San Ramon ,\nCalifornia-based Chevron said in a statement today. Per-share\nresults were 15 cents less than the $2.84 average of 19\nanalysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Oil and natural gas  production  from Chevron\u2019s wells dropped\nto the lowest since the third quarter of 2008 after Hurricane\nIsaac shut output in the  Gulf of Mexico  and oilfield repairs\nwere conducted in Kazakhstan and the U.K. Isaac also forced the\nshutdown of Chevron\u2019s largest refinery in Pascagoula,\n Mississippi , and a fire damaged the company\u2019s San Francisco-area\nplant.  Chevron\u2019s fuel-production profit fell by $1.3 billion to\n$689 million because of the plant outages and declining fuel\nmargins. The U.S. margin for processing oil into gasoline and\ndiesel fell 5.2 percent to an average of $30.86 per barrel\nduring the quarter, based on benchmark futures contracts traded\nin New York.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson is\nspending almost $90 million a day this year to expand the search\nfor untapped reserves from the  Indian Ocean  to the Baltic Sea.\nThe company is aiming to raise production by one-fifth by the\nend of 2017 to the equivalent of 3.3 million barrels of crude.

Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the\nworld\u2019s oil, fell 2.4 percent during the quarter to an average\nof $109.42 a barrel. Worldwide crude output rose by 2.16 million\nbarrels a day during the third quarter from a year earlier, four\ntimes faster than the 540,000-barrel-a-day increase in demand,\naccording to an Oct. 12 report by the  International Energy\nAgency .  Chevron\u2019s performance also was diminished by a 29 percent\ndecline in U.S. gas prices from a year earlier to an average of\n$2.893 per million British thermal units during the quarter.\nHorizontal wells and hydraulic fracturing have allowed explorers\nto penetrate gas-rich shale formations in the U.S. Great Plains,\nAppalachia and western Canada, leading to a North American\nsupply glut.
