(DELL)  said yesterday it\nreceived proposals from  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and  Carl Icahn  that\nmay be superior to Michael Dell\u2019s $24.4 billion buyout plan,\nputting pressure on the founder to sweeten his terms or switch\nallegiances. The new bidders increase the number of lawyers who\nare working on the deal.  Blackstone\u2019s plan values Dell at more than $14.25 a share,\nwhile Icahn would pay $15 a share in cash for as much as 58.1\npercent of the stock, Dell said yesterday in a statement that\nincluded their offers. Under both plans, some shares may\ncontinue to be publicly traded. Michael Dell, who proposed\n$13.65 a share, is willing to work with third parties on the\nalternative plans, the company said.  The challenges, under the \u201cgo-shop\u201d provisions of the\noriginal bid, came as Dell struggles to catch up with a new wave\nof nimbler competitors in mobile computing and business\nservices, mean  Michael Dell  could lose control of the firm he\nfounded in his Texas dorm room in 1984. His plan, backed by\npartner Silver Lake Management LLC, was to  retool  Dell as a\nmaker of data-center gear and software for corporations --\nwithout the scrutiny of public investors.  Blackstone, which proposes a leveraged recapitalization\ntransaction, is represented by partners David Fox, Daniel Wolf\nand Leo Greenberg of Kirkland & Ellis LLP. Under the bid,\ninvestors could choose to get either all cash or equity, subject\nto a cap, if they want to stay invested in Dell. The shares\nwould continue to be publicly traded.  Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP often represents Blackstone,\nbut it is representing Silver Lake in the original buyout bid.\nDebevoise & Plimpton LLP is advising the special committee of\nDell\u2019s board. Hogan Lovells LLP is advising Dell and Wachtell,\nLipton, Rosen & Katz is advising Michael Dell.  Icahn is offering shareholders the option to roll over\ntheir stakes or receive $15 a share in cash, with the amount of\ncash to be used limited to $15.65 billion, according to the\nstatement. Icahn has enlisted Jefferies LLC to conduct due\ndiligence on Dell.  Icahn\u2019s offer assumes that Southeastern Asset Management\nInc. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., among the largest Dell\ninvestors after Michael Dell, would contribute their stakes and\nwon\u2019t receive a cash payment.  Keith Schaitkin, the general counsel of  Icahn Enterprises\nLP (IEP) , declined to disclose the lawyers who worked on Icahn\u2019s bid.  For more on the bids, click here.

Law Firm News  Former Client Accuses DLA Piper of Churning Fees in Lawsuit  A lawsuit between  DLA Piper  LLP and a former client is\noffering a rare look at  law firm  billing, the  New York  Times\nreported. E-mails from lawyers at the firm expose, according to\na brief filed by the former client, Adam Victor, attorneys who\n\u201cchurn time, inflate bills, create unneeded work or expend time\nperforming useless work.\u201d  The law firm last year sued Victor in New York state court\nseeking fees for work done in the restructuring of Victor\u2019s\nenergy business, Project Orange Associates. DLA Piper had to\nwithdraw because of a client contact, but claims it remained\ncounsel to Victor personally and incurred more than $600,000 in\nfees, according to court documents.  Victor\u2019s lawyers at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP filed the\ne-mails last week from DLA Piper lawyers suggesting the\nmagnitude of the bills. One e-mail read, \u201cI hear we are already\n200k over our estimate -- that\u2019s Team DLA Piper!\u201d Another e-\nmail said one lawyer \u201chas random people working full time on\nrandom research projects\u201d in \u201c\u2018churn that bill, baby!\u2019 mode.\u201d  \u201cAs a firm, we hold ourselves to the highest legal and\nethical standards,\u201d Joshua Epstein, a spokesman for DLA Piper,\nsaid in an e-mail. \u201cThe behavior as described is unacceptable\nto DLA Piper and our clients.  \u2018\u2018The e-mails were in fact an offensive and inexcusable\neffort at humor, but in no way reflect actual excessive\nbilling,\u2019\u2019 Epstein said. \u2018\u2018Instead, the reality of the matter is\nthat the amount of fees billed by DLA Piper was consistent with\nan understanding expressly reached with the client.\u2019\u2019  The case is DLA Piper v. Victor, 650374/2012  Supreme Court \nof the State of New York ( Manhattan ).

News  New York Seeks Approval to Finish $410 Million Merkin Settlement  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman asked a federal\njudge for permission to complete a $410 million settlement with\nJ. Ezra Merkin, using his law enforcement powers to compensate\nthe former Bernard Madoff investor\u2019s victims.  Madoff brokerage liquidator  Irving Picard , who seeks to\ncollect $500 million from Merkin for different investors, is\ntrying to block the deal. Schneiderman has argued that Picard\nhas no claim to the settlement money and lacks power as a\nbankruptcy trustee to stop the state from enforcing the people\u2019s\nlegal rights.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff began a hearing in Manhattan\nfederal court yesterday by asking the parties to address the\nstate\u2019s argument that Picard had waited too long to try to block\nits suit. David Ellenhorn, a lawyer from Schneiderman\u2019s office,\ntold Rakoff that investors refrained from bringing their own\nclaims against Merkin in reliance on the attorney general\u2019s\nsuit.  Investors in Merkin\u2019s hedge funds lost more than $1.2\nbillion in the Madoff fraud, New York has said. Madoff, arrested\nin 2008, is serving 150 years in prison for the largest  Ponzi\nscheme  in U.S. history, which effaced an estimated $17 billion\nof investors\u2019 principal.  The combatants portray their deadlocked fight as a clash\nbetween state law, governing a top law enforcer, and bankruptcy\nlaw, regulating trustees in fraud cases. Rakoff took over the\ncase from a bankruptcy judge to decide if Schneiderman can\ncomplete the deal with Merkin.  Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard, said earlier this\nmonth the parties hadn\u2019t had talks to resolve the dispute \u2018\u2018of\nlate and none are anticipated.\u201d James Freedland, a spokesman\nfor Schneiderman, has declined to comment on the possibility of\na truce.  With Picard\u2019s consent, the settlement agreement struck with\nMerkin was filed under seal in court after Merkin requested\nconfidentiality for some material he provided.  The case is Picard v. Schneiderman, 12-cv-06733, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  For more, click here.
