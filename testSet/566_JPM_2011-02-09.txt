 "context": "The following article called 'WaMu, Junco Steel, Meridian, Hardage: Bankruptcy' was published on 2011-02-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWashington Mutual Inc . shareholders\ncan question  hedge funds  about allegations they used\nconfidential information to trade in the bankrupt company\u2019s\nsecurities, a judge said.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath approved the probe\nyesterday in Wilmington,  Delaware . Authorizing depositions and\ndocument subpoenas may be the only way to determine whether the\nhedge funds violated bankruptcy rules related to insider\ntrading, she said.  A committee of shareholders sought to investigate\nallegations of insider trading by Appaloosa Management LP, Owl\nCreek Asset Management LP, Centerbridge Partners LP and Aurelius\nCapital Management LP. Walrath said she was troubled by the\nallegations.  WaMu, based in  Seattle , filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 26,\n2008, the day after its banking unit was taken over by\nregulators and sold to New York-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co . for\n$1.9 billion. Washington Mutual Bank was the biggest bank to\nfail in U.S. history, with more than 2,200 branches and\n$188 billion in deposits.  The hedge funds own WaMu notes and are set to receive a\npayout as part of the company\u2019s proposed bankruptcy plan. The\nfunds are allied with JPMorgan and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp., which are trying to persuade Walrath to approve a\nproposal to end WaMu\u2019s bankruptcy by paying bondholders and\nother creditors more than $7 billion.  The centerpiece of the bankruptcy plan is a settlement\nsupported by JPMorgan, the FDIC and the noteholders that is\nvalued at about $10 billion. The shareholders and some lower-\nranking creditors oppose the settlement and the payment proposal\nbecause it would give them nothing.  WaMu yesterday filed a new plan and a new version of the\nsettlement. The company has proposed coming back to court in May\nto seek Walrath\u2019s approval of both.  The insider-trading investigation must be concluded before\nthat May hearing, where shareholders will use any information\ncollected to attack the proposed plan and the settlement. The\nhedge funds will be required to reveal details of their\npurchases and sales in WaMu debt since the company filed for\nbankruptcy and any protections they put in place to avoid\nmisusing confidential information.  The case is In re  Washington  Mutual Inc., 08-12229,  U.S.\nBankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).
