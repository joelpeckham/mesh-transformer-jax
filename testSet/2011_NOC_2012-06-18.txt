 "context": "The following article called 'Drones Most Accident-Prone U.S. Air Force Craft: BGOV Barometer' was published on 2012-06-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. military\u2019s three biggest\ndrones, made by  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  and General Atomics\nAeronautical Systems Inc., are the most accident-prone aircraft\nin the Air Force fleet.  The BGOV Barometer shows Northrop\u2019s Global Hawk and General\nAtomics\u2019s Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles have had\na combined 9.31 accidents for every 100,000 hours of flying.\nThat\u2019s the highest rate of any category of aircraft and more\nthan triple the fleet-wide average of 3.03, according to\nmilitary data compiled by Bloomberg.  The June 11 crash of a drone near Bloodsworth Island on\n Maryland \u2019s Eastern Shore illustrated the vehicles\u2019 propensity\nfor accidents, known as \u201cmishaps\u201d in military parlance. The\nconcern is that drones\u2019 safety record won\u2019t improve as they\u2019re\nincreasingly deployed for testing, border surveillance and other\nmissions in U.S. airspace, said Jay Stanley, a spokesman for the\n American Civil Liberties Union  in Washington.  \u201cIf we have 30,000 flying pieces of robotic hardware\nbuzzing above our heads, Americans are going to want to be very\ncertain that it\u2019s safe, in addition to putting in place good\nrules to protect our privacy,\u201d Stanley said in a telephone\ninterview.  President  Barack Obama  in February signed legislation\ndirecting the  Federal Aviation Administration  to develop a plan\nby Sept. 30, 2015 for integrating civil unmanned aerial vehicles\ninto national airspace.  129 Accidents  The Air Force in a 15-year period through Sept. 30 recorded\n129 accidents involving its medium- and high-altitude drones:\nthe MQ-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk. The figures\ninclude accidents that resulted in at least $500,000 in damage\nor destroyed aircraft during missions around the globe.  Vertical-lift aircraft, including helicopters and the tilt-\nrotor V-22 Osprey made by  Boeing Co. (BA)  and  Textron Inc. (TXT) , had the\nsecond-highest accident rate, with 6.33 per 100,000 flight\nhours. Training planes had the lowest rate at 1.69.  The higher incidence of drone accidents is partly due to\nthe new technology, according to Peter Singer, a senior fellow\nat the  Brookings Institution , a nonprofit policy organization in\nWashington.  \u201cThere tend to be more mishaps and mistakes with any new\ntechnology, manned or unmanned,\u201d Singer said in an e-mail. When\nthe kinks get worked out and expertise builds, \u201ccrash rates\ntend to go down.\u201d  Drone Hits Target  As the military flew drones in  Iraq ,  Afghanistan  and\nelsewhere during the past decade, their accident rates declined\nto 5.13 per 100,000 flight hours in fiscal 2011 from 62.06 in\nfiscal 2001.  The Predator\u2019s accident rate fell to 4.86 last year,\ncompared with the F-16 Fighting Falcon\u2019s 3.89 rate when the\nfighter jet was at the same point in its service life.  Unmanned planes also tend to be used in different ways than\nmanned versions, Singer said. In Afghanistan, U.S. military\npersonnel \u201cwere tracking a high-value target and didn\u2019t have\nany missiles left,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they flew the drone into the\ntarget.\u201d  According to an  Air Force  definition, \u201ca mishap is an\nunplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences.\u201d  The drone that was destroyed after crashing into a swamp\nabout 22 miles east of Naval Air Station Patuxent River last\nweek was a Global Hawk, the largest and most expensive type of\nmilitary drone, costing $233 million each. The Pentagon says it\nwants to spend $3.39 billion on unmanned aircraft in the fiscal\nyear starting Oct. 1.  Replacing U-2  The cause of the crash is still under investigation. Most\ndrone accidents are caused by component failures or operator\nerror.  The Global Hawk has an accident rate of 15.16 per 100,000\nflight hours, almost three times that of the aircraft it\u2019s\ndesigned to replace, the Cold War-era U-2 spy plane.  \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to make direct comparisons between\nunmanned and manned systems regarding loss\u201d because of their\nage and technological differences,  Randy Belote , a spokesman for\n Falls Church , Virginia-based Northrop, said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cThese systems fly much longer because you don\u2019t\nhave to land for crew comfort and safety.\u201d  The Predator, made by General Atomics, has had 9.26\naccidents per 100,000 flight hours, while its Reaper has had\n7.96. Kimberly Kasitz, a spokeswoman for Poway, California-based\nGeneral Atomics Aeronautical Systems, declined to comment.
