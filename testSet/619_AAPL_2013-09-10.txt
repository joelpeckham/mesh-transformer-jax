 "context": "The following article called 'Apple Unveils New IPhones at Cheaper Price' was published on 2013-09-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc. (AAPL)  unveiled two new iPhones, including a cheaper $99 version in bright colors and an updated high-end device, in a strategy shift by Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  to reach a broader range of customers around the world.  A new iPhone known as the 5C will start at $99 with a two-year contract and will come in five colors, Apple said today at an event at its headquarters in Cupertino,  California . The high-end iPhone 5S, which will be available in three colors including gold, will cost $199 to $399 with a contract. The phones will be available in stores Sept. 20.  \u201cThe business has become so large,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to replace it with not one, but two new designs.\u201d  The product introductions underline how Apple, which was a trailblazer when it debuted the iPhone in 2007, is increasingly following the strategy of other smartphone makers that offer handsets in different colors and prices. Until now, Apple only released one new iPhone model every year. As competing devices running Google Inc.\u2019s Android software gain in popularity in the $280 billion smartphone market, Apple is expanding its iPhone lineup to reach more customers.  \u201cThe competition has caught up and it\u2019s now purely about how quickly it can innovate and drive its own experience forward,\u201d said Benedict Evans, an analyst with Enders Analysis in  London .  Apple also said it was adding  Japan \u2019s largest carrier,  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , and that it would have devices immediately available in  China  for the first time. The company is near a deal with  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world\u2019s largest carrier, people familiar with the plans have said.  Stock Falls  The announcements didn\u2019t stem a stock drop for Apple, with the company\u2019s shares falling 2.3 percent to close at $494.64 in New York. Analysts said the event lacked surprise, given that many pictures and details about the new iPhones had leaked in the past few months.  Apple was also not as aggressive on price as some investors had hoped. \u201cMany investors were hoping for that one single atomic event where they got aggressive on pricing,\u201d said  Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. \u201cInstead, in Apple\u2019s own way they think they can accomplish their goal -- gaining market share -- without blowing up their margins.\u201d  Nonetheless, offering iPhones at lower prices also poses risks. With a lower-priced iPhone, Apple is \u201cwalking a tightrope between growth and profitability,\u201d said Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research.  Supply Chain  Adding new iPhone colors also complicates Apple\u2019s supply chain by adding to the sprawl of models that consumers can choose from, said Mike Fawkes, a former supply-chain executive at Hewlett-Packard Co. \u201cThis increases their complexity a lot,\u201d he said.  Each iPhone unveiling is critical for Apple because the handset accounts for about half its revenue. Rivals including  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  using Android software have taken market share by offering more handsets in varying styles and prices. IPhone sales trailed the overall smartphone market\u2019s growth in the last two quarters.  The new iPhones, which are Apple\u2019s first major product debut since the iPad mini hit stores last year, follow a tough 12 months for the company. Apart from heavy competition, Apple grappled with flawed mapping software and a management shake-up, as well as stepped-up U.S. government scrutiny of some of its business practices.  Apple Response  Apple is responding with the new iPhones, which made their debut in front of a crowd that included Apple board member and former Vice President Al Gore and Twitter Inc. co-founder Jack Dorsey. Musician Elvis Costello also played toward the end of the event.  The iPhone 5C, which has a plastic casing and a 4-inch screen, will come in blue, green, pink, yellow and white. Without a contract, the 16-gigabyte version will cost $549 and the 32-gigabyte version will cost $649, according to Apple\u2019s online store. It can be pre-ordered starting Sept. 13.  The iPhone 5S will come in white, black and gold and has a 64-bit chip that the company said will make it work twice as fast as the iPhone 5. It will also have Touch ID fingerprint-sensor technology that is located on the phone\u2019s Home button, which people can use to unlock their phone and confirm purchases from iTunes and Apple\u2019s app store. Without a contract, the 5S costs $649 to $849, according to Apple\u2019s online store.  Paying Up  The high off-contract prices indicate Apple is still betting customers will pay more for the iPhone, said Forrester\u2019s Rotman Epps. \u201cThey aren\u2019t trying to compete for the bottom of the market,\u201d she said.  Apple also revamped its mobile software with the introduction of iOS 7, which will be available for free starting Sept. 18. The overhaul includes new sounds, picture-sharing features, and an iTunes radio feature.  At the event, the company said 700 million iOS devices would be sold by next month. Apple added that its Siri digital assistant is \u201cmassively improved\u201d and now draws information from Twitter and Wikipedia, among other things.  More new Apple products are expected this year in the run-up to the holiday shopping season. The company is expected to introduce new iPads later this year, people familiar with the plans have said.
