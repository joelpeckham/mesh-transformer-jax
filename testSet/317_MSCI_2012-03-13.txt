 "context": "The following article called 'Milk Souring as Record Profit Spurs Expansion of Herds' was published on 2012-03-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRecord dairy profits and milder\nweather are leading to a surge in milk supplies from Auckland to\n California , turning last year\u2019s best-performing commodity\ncontract into one of the worst of 2012.  Output in the U.S., the world\u2019s largest producer, will\nadvance 1.8 percent to a record 199.7 billion pounds (90.6\nmillion metric tons) in 2012, the Department of Agriculture\nestimates. Futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\nalready fell 29 percent from a four-year high in August and may\ndrop another 8 percent to $14.25 per 100 pounds by July, the\nmedian of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  An estimated 30 percent jump in U.S. dairy exports led to\nthe most profitable year ever for farmers, who expanded  herds \nthat now are the biggest since May 2009, USDA data show. Yields\nreached a record during an unusually mild winter. Supply is also\nrising in  Australia  and New Zealand, the largest exporter, and\ndairy was the only food cost tracked by the  United Nations  to\ndecline last month.  \u201cThis blasted weather that most people have enjoyed, the\ndairy cows have really enjoyed it,\u201d said  Bill Brooks , an\neconomist for INTL FCStone Inc. in  Kansas City , who grew up on a\ndairy farm in  Missouri  and has covered the industry for two\ndecades. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more milk production.\u201d  Agriculture Index  Milk futures that jumped 31 percent last year, more than\nany of the 24 commodities in the Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Spot\nIndex, dropped 10 percent since Dec. 30 to close at $15.49 at\n1:10 p.m. in  Chicago . Only natural gas and arabica coffee fell\nmore. The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index advanced 1.4 percent this\nyear, as the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose 11\npercent. Treasuries lost 0.5 percent, a Bank of America Corp.\nindex shows.  U.S. dairy farmers had 9.236 million cows in January, the\n14th herd expansion in 16 months, USDA data show. Each animal\n produced  a record 21,345 pounds (9.7 metric tons) of milk last\nyear. Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the largest dairy\nexporter, shipped 246,000 tons in December, the most ever.\nDeliveries to its plants rose 9.8 percent in the eight months\nended Jan. 31, the Auckland-based company said last month.  Rising supply may meet weaker gains in demand. China, the\nbiggest buyer of U.S. agricultural products, is targeting\neconomic growth of 7.5 percent, the lowest since 2004, Premier\n Wen Jiabao  said March 5. The economy gained 8.9 percent in the\nfourth quarter, the slowest pace in 10 quarters.  Feed Costs  Declining milk prices and rising cattle-feed costs may\nrequire farmers to cull herds, reducing supply, said Chip Whalen, a vice president of education and research at Chicago-\nbased Commodity & Ingredient Hedging LLC, which advises clients\non managing commodity price swings. Corn futures averaged $6.78\na bushel in Chicago last year, the most in at least a half\ncentury. Record beef prices also may encourage more\nslaughtering.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to go through another one of these cycles\nwhere we\u2019re going to cull the herd,\u201d said  Shawn Hackett , the\npresident of Hackett Financial Advisers Inc., a brokerage and\nconsultant based in  Boynton Beach ,  Florida . \u201cWe\u2019re setting a\nstage for a significant slowdown in production growth, starting\nin the later part of this year,\u201d said Hackett, who anticipates\na rally to $18 in the second half of 2012.  While  China  may slow this year, the U.S. will expand 2.2\npercent from 1.7 percent in 2011, according to the median of 79\neconomist estimates compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. consumption of\nfluid milk will reach 28.61 million tons this year, the highest\nsince at least 1964, and cheese demand will advance to 4.83\nmillion tons, the most since at least 1965, USDA data show. The\nU.S., with 4.5 percent of the global population, eats 32 percent\nof the world\u2019s cheese production and drinks 6.2 percent of its\nmilk, the department estimates.  Cull Herds  Farmers may be reluctant to cull herds. While losses this\nyear may hurt some dairies, most are in better financial shape\nthan in 2009 and 2010, so there won\u2019t be a \u201cwholesale decrease\nin cow numbers,\u201d said Jon Spainhour, a broker and partner at\nRice Dairy LLC in Chicago.  In 2009, the average for milk futures slumped to $11.56, a\nsix-year low, before rebounding in 2011 to $18.55. Last year,\nthe average dairy farm had net cash income of $239,800, the most\never, the USDA estimated Feb. 13, up from $158,100 in 2010 and\n$70,100 in 2009.  Exports were the \u201ckey factor\u201d in last year\u2019s rally, said\nBob Cropp, an economist at the  University of Wisconsin  in\nMadison who has been studying the industry since 1966. U.S.\ndairy exports totaled $4.78 billion in 2011, up from $3.69\nbillion in 2010, according to the USDA\u2019s  Foreign Agricultural\nService . Shipments will drop 2.2 percent in 2012, according to a\nreport by USDA economist Milton Madison at a Feb. 24 forum in\n Washington .  Industry Projects  The industry is now facing more competition in export\nmarkets, said Brooks of INTL FCStone. Output in  New Zealand ,\ncurbed by drought last year, may rise 8 percent to 10 percent\nthis season, according to Southbank, Australia-based Dairy\nAustralia, which raises levies from farmers to fund industry\nprojects.  Production in Australia may rise 1.4 percent to 9.55\nbillion liters (2.5 billion gallons) in the year beginning July\n1, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics\nand Sciences said in a report March 6. Flooding last year\nlimited output and disrupted transportation.  U.S. output is also rising on improving weather. The three-\nmonth period ended in January was the sixth-warmest-ever for\nthat time of year, according to Brad Rippey, a meteorologist\nwith the USDA. The four warmest all happened since 1998 and the\nother was in 1933-1934, the dust bowl era.  California Dairies  Milk production in California, the largest producing state,\nclimbed 6.6 percent in January from a year earlier to 3.615\nbillion pounds, the highest on record for that month, USDA  data \nshow. There\u2019s \u201cmilk coming out of our ears,\u201d said Bill Schiek,\nan economist at the Dairy Institute of California in  Sacramento ,\nwhich represents processors in the state.  The drop in prices is no incentive to cut production for\nRay Souza, who has 900 Holstein cows on his farm in Turlock,\nCalifornia. Farmers tend to react by increasing output because\ntheir costs remain similar, he said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve never produced at this level before,\u201d said the 65-\nyear-old, who has been in the dairy business since 1973. \u201cCows\nproduce more milk in the springtime than they do in any other\npart of the year. This spring seems to have started around the\nfirst of December.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nElizabeth Campbell in Chicago at \n ecampbell14@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSteve Stroth at \n sstroth@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 33.67559051513672 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
