FILE PHOTO - The headquarters of HSBC bank in London's Canary Wharf financial district, Britain, March 11, 2016. REUTERS/Russell Boyce/File Photo Lumsden, who counts British television presenter Davina McCall among the clients of his gym, TWPT, in the affluent spa town of Tunbridge Wells in Southern England, was unable to receive payments or pay his bills. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take payments, I couldn\u2019t pay my suppliers, all my direct debits would be rejected which could affect my credit rating and I had 16,000 pounds ($22,209.60)locked in the account that I couldn\u2019t access,\u201d he told Reuters at his gym. He is one of hundreds of HSBC clients whose accounts have been frozen as part of a compliance crackdown called Safeguard aimed at fighting financial crime, even after the bank said in September it had addressed flaws in the program. Many of those affected run small businesses like Lumsden, who has 6 members of staff. The closure of the main business account can be critical for such companies. HSBC reinstated Lumsden\u2019s bank account within hours of being contacted by Reuters to ask about the reasons for the closure. Others have not been so lucky. Interviews with HSBC customers, letters and emails from the bank seen by Reuters, and a review of the lender\u2019s social media complaints channels show some problems continue, and in some cases are worse. A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment on the Lumsden case but said there had been some mistakes in the Safeguard program. He said the number of firms affected is a small percentage of the bank\u2019s overall customer base. \u201cWhilst the vast majority of the thousands of customer reviews we undertake proceed without incident, some mistakes are made and we apologize to those customers affected,\u201d he said. The account freezes come at a particularly sensitive time for small businesses waiting to see what Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union will bring. \u201cAs they look to increase day to day scrutiny, it\u2019s vital that lenders don\u2019t accidentally clamp down on innocent small business owners,\u201d said Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses. \u2018MISTAKES ARE MADE\u2019 The Safeguard program was launched in 2012 to gather more information about customers, such as who their own customers are and why they made or received certain payments. Complaints started to build up after they received a questionnaire in September 2015 presented by the bank as a routine check. HSBC introduced the program partly in response to scrutiny from the U.S. authorities who said that weak anti-money laundering controls had allowed Mexican drug cartels to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through the bank. HSBC was under threat of prosecution for five years unless it tightened controls. That period ended in December without prosecution. After Reuters and other media reported on problems with Safeguard\u2019s administration last year, HSBC said it had made a number of improvements. But Lumsden, and other new examples uncovered by Reuters, show that the process still is not working for everyone. British lawmakers said the bank still needed to take steps to improve. \u201cTo see that this has failed on a number of occasions at a very basic level raises clear concerns, and we expect that these are being proactively addressed by the bank,\u201d said Kevin Hollinrake, British lawmaker and co-chair of the cross-party group on fair business banking. MORTIFIED World Merit Limited, a charity that works with the United Nations and helps young people to volunteer, said last month HSBC froze its bank accounts for three weeks. It was impossible to pay staff and the freeze threatened the charity\u2019s reputation, Chief Executive Chris Arnold said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked and mortified that we could be put through the wringer like this,\u201d Arnold said. HSBC said it had sent letters as far back as a year ago warning World Merit that it would have to close the account if it did not provide the necessary information. Arnold said the bank had been using out-of-date contact details, and had failed to follow up its misdirected letters with other forms of communication until this year. Another customer, who runs a small furniture business in South London but did not want to be named, said he had tried to file the Safeguard paperwork at his local HSBC branch but staff did not know how to help him. As he was unable to fill in the forms, he said HSBC also threatened to shut the account. Personal trainer Lumsden said he understands the reasons for the Safeguard program, but that his case shows the bank still has not fixed all the problems with it. \u201cA multi-billion pound bank like HSBC doesn\u2019t care if some gym in Tunbridge Wells moves its account somewhere else, but for a business like us these bank problems can have a massive impact. Whatever their system is, it isn\u2019t working.\u201d ($1 = 0.7204 pounds)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 41.90247344970703 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
