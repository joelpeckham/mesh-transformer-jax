 "context": "The following article called 'Record Defaults Seen on $40 Billion Recast Loans: India Credit' was published on 2013-09-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRestructured loans are defaulting\nat a record rate at Indian banks amid forecasts the worst\n economic  slowdown in a decade will deepen, according to the\ninvestment banking unit of the nation\u2019s biggest lender.  As much as 20 percent of renegotiated credit in  India \u2019s\nbanking system is now classified as in default, according to  SBI\nCapital Markets Ltd.  Such loans, which give borrowers a\nmoratorium on payments, longer maturities or lower  interest\nrates , more than doubled since 2009 to 2.5 trillion rupees ($40\nbillion) at the end of June, data from the Corporate Debt\nRestructuring Mechanism show.  Bad loans are rising as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicts\n India\u2019s economy  will grow 4 percent this fiscal year, after a 5\npercent gain in the prior period that was the smallest since\n2003. The yield on State Bank of India\u2019s 9.95 percent rupee debt\ndue 2026 rose 74 basis points this quarter to 9.54 percent, the\nmost since the notes were issued in 2011. That on Bank of China\nLtd.\u2019s 2020 dollar bonds fell 57 basis points to 4.09 percent.  \u201cNobody expected the slowdown to last this long while\nrecasting the debt,\u201d Supratim Sarkar, head of structured\nfinance in Mumbai at SBI Capital, a unit of government-owned\n State Bank , said in an interview on Sept. 23. \u201cRestructured\nloans are slipping into the non-performing category at a faster\npace than ever before. I expect this to pick up further.\u201d  Funding Costs  Asset quality at Indian banks is deteriorating as a surge\nin funding costs hurts the repayment ability of businesses\nalready bearing the brunt of the economic slowdown. Five-year\nbond yields for top-rated local companies have jumped 156 basis\npoints since the end of May to 9.82 percent, as the central bank\ncreated a cash crunch to stem a plunge in the rupee. Three-month\ncommercial paper rates rose 150 basis points to 9.95 percent.  Soured debt swelled to 3.92 percent of total loans at the\nend of June, the highest level in at least five years, from 3.4\npercent at the end of March, RBI data show. The ratio was 6\npercent for restructured credit. The increase is threatening to\nerode earnings at Indian banks, which are required to set aside\nmore cash as risk provisions against non-performing assets.  Return on equity at local lenders, which tracks profit\ngenerated with shareholders\u2019 funds, may fall below 10 percent in\nthe year to March from a five-year low of 12.8 percent in the\nprevious period, Vibha Batra, co-head of financial-sector\nratings in  New Delhi  at a unit of Moody\u2019s Investors Service,\nsaid in an interview on Aug. 21.  \u2018Limping Along\u2019  \u201cIndian banks are going through a difficult phase,\u201d\nSaurabh Mukherjea, chief executive officer for institutional\nequities at Mumbai-based Ambit Capital Pvt., said in an\ninterview on Sept. 23. \u201cThree years into a downturn if the\nborrowers are limping along, it is only to be expected. This\nwill worsen if the cost of financing is rising.\u201d  Moody\u2019s Investors Service lowered this month the ratings on\nState Bank\u2019s senior unsecured debt and local-currency deposits\nto Baa3 from Baa2. The rating company also cut the outlook on\nthe lender\u2019s financial strength to negative from stable. The\ncredit assessor\u2019s concern about State Bank is misplaced because\nthe lender has adequate capital, Mumbai-based Chief Financial\nOfficer Arundhati Bhattacharya said in a Sept. 24 phone\ninterview.  Bank bond risk in India is rising. Credit-default swaps\ninsuring State Bank\u2019s debt against non-payment for five years\nhave risen 121 basis points from the year\u2019s low of 174 in May,\naccording to data provider CMA. The contracts climbed 106 basis\npoints last month in the biggest surge since October 2008.  Stressed Assets  Fitch Ratings  cut state-owned Indian Bank\u2019s debt ranking to\nBB+ from BBB- on Sept. 23, while reducing the viability rating\nof government-controlled Punjab National Bank and  Bank of Baroda \nto BB+ from BBB-.  \u201cFitch expects that asset quality at Indian banks,\nparticularly state-owned ones, will worsen, resulting in a\nlarger amount of stressed assets than initially forecast and the\namount would peak only in year ending March 2015,\u201d analysts at\nthe ratings company led by Singapore-based Ambreesh Srivastava\nsaid in a statement on the same day.  Restructured loans jumped 50 percent for the 10 largest\nstate-owned banks in twelve months to March 31, compared with a\n36 percent increase in bad loans, according to Fitch. An average\n7.2 percent of state-run lenders\u2019 loans were restructured as of\nMarch 31, central bank data show. The ratio was 4 percent on\naverage for the biggest private-sector banks, including ICICI\nBank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd.  Rajan\u2019s Plan  Raghuram Rajan , who took charge as India\u2019s central bank\ngovernor on Sept. 4, has said he will focus on strengthening the\nfinancial industry and signaled measures to make it easier for\nbanks to curb bad loans and lend to non-state sectors of the\neconomy. He also called for a reduction in their requirement to\ninvest in government debt to free up more money for funding\ncompanies and projects. The steps will have a \u201cmajor long-term\nimpact\u201d on the earnings of financial institutions, according to\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.  The RBI also plans to ease restrictions on the expansion of\nbranch networks, according to Rajan.  India\u2019s S&P BSE Bankex index, a gauge of 13 banking stocks,\nsurged 9.3 percent on Sept. 5, the biggest rally since May 2009,\nafter Rajan outlined plans to reinforce the financial system.  While the RBI\u2019s proposals will help, policies with wider\neconomic impact such as steps to boost the infrastructure sector\nand capital injections into state banks are required for bigger\nimprovements in the financial system, according to SBI Capital.  Lanco, Educomp  \u201cThe latest RBI measures stress on a clean-up of banks\u2019\nbooks but the big push can only come through bank\nrecapitalization,\u201d SBI Capital\u2019s Sarkar said. \u201cAs the\nmoratorium on interest payments gets over, more restructured\nloans are falling into the non-performing category.\u201d  SBI Capital is currently helping companies including Lanco\nInfratech Ltd., Educomp Solutions Ltd. and Bombay Rayon Fashions\nLtd. recast loans, according to Sarkar. Banks have to set aside\nmore money as provisions for bad loans than restructured loans.  Yields on lenders\u2019 local-currency bonds have climbed since\nMay. The rate on  five-year notes  ranked AAA by local companies\nhas increased to 9.64 percent from 7.96 percent as of May 31,\naccording to indicative rates compiled by Bloomberg.  Ten-year (GIND10YR) \ngovernment yields added 146 basis points in the same period to\n8.71 percent. The yield on the benchmark 7.16 percent sovereign\nnotes due May 2023 fell one basis point on Sept. 27, while the\nrupee weakened 0.7 percent to 62.4975 per dollar.  The extra yield on State Bank\u2019s bonds due 2017 over U.S.\nTreasuries has climbed to 336 basis points from this year\u2019s low\nof 229 in February, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That on\nICICI Bank Ltd.\u2019s 2018 debt rose to 346 from 242.  \u201cThe run rate of slippages from restructured loans at many\nbanks have crossed 30 percent,\u201d Nitin Kumar, a Mumbai-based\nbanking analyst at Quant Broking Ltd., said in an interview\nSept. 27. \u201cOur concern is that the ability of many of those\nlenders to raise capital to absorb the mounting losses remains\nconstrained in current economic scenario.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAnto Antony in Mumbai at \n aantony1@bloomberg.net ;\nBhuma Shrivastava in Mumbai at \n bshrivastav1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChitra Somayaji at \n csomayaji@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 41.431861877441406 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
