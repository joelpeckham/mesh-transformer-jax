 "context": "The following article called 'Abe Puts Property Deals on Pace for Best Year Since 2008' was published on 2013-07-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapanese stocks are the biggest\nwinners in the world this year. The yen is down the most of any\nmajor currency, helping exporters. And as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s efforts to stoke the economy take tentative hold, Japan\u2019s\ncommercial property market is coming back to life.  Sales of offices, logistics and retail space surged 70\npercent to 1.48 trillion yen ($15 billion) in the first five\nmonths of 2013 from a year earlier, according to  Jones Lang\nLaSalle Inc. (JLL)  Deals will rise to as much as 3.5 trillion yen this\nyear, the most since 2008, Takeshi Akagi, local director at the\nChicago-based broker estimates.  Abe, who took office in December, has boosted spending and\nthe  Bank of Japan  has embarked on an unprecedented monetary\neasing in a drive to end 15 years of deflation. The approach,\ndubbed Abenomics, is lifting the confidence of investors such as\n Nippon Building Fund Inc. (8951)  and AXA Real Estate Investment\nManagers in a market that has languished since an asset bubble\nburst more than two decades ago.  \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would argue that there hasn\u2019t been a\nfavorable sentiment shift since Abe came to power,\u201d Christian Mancini, chief executive officer of North East Asia at Savills\nAsia Pacific Ltd., said in an interview. \u201cInflation translates\ninto balance-sheet recovery and has a knock-on effect on the\nreal estate market.\u201d  Among the signs of improvement:  Tokyo \u2019s office vacancy rate\nfell for a third month in May and is down from a record a year\nago, while prices are inching higher. Land values are rising,\naccording to government data that tracks 150 prime sites around\nthe country.  The 43-member Topix Real Estate Index rose to the highest\nin a week, gaining 1.9 percent at the close of trading in Tokyo\ntoday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index advanced 1.2 percent,\nthe biggest gain in two weeks.  REITs Buying  Japanese real estate investment trusts, known as J-REITs,\nare leading the charge after a 28 percent gain in their shares\nsince Abe took office has made it easier to raise funds to\nacquire properties. The Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index has\nrisen 23 percent so far this year.  J-REITs may sell about 900 billion yen of shares this year\nto help pay for acquisitions that will probably total 2.5\ntrillion yen, said  Yoji Otani , a Tokyo-based analyst at Deutsche\nBank AG. The figures would exceed the 848 billion yen in\nfinancing and 1.9 trillion yen in purchases in 2006, both\nrecords, Otani said.  \u201cSome of the J-REITs and some of the property companies\nare willing to purchase very aggressively right now to lock into\nwhat they believe would be an improvement in the market,\u201d\nSavills\u2019s Mancini said. \u201cYou can expect prices going forward\nwill continue to improve.\u201d  Selling Properties  Nippon Building Fund, Japan\u2019s biggest REIT, has spent 156.8\nbillion yen on office buildings this year, including a Tokyo\ntower it bought with other investors from  Sony Corp. (6758)  for 111.1 \nbillion yen. The REIT may acquire more than 50 billion yen a year \nif there are good properties, Kenichi Tanaka, president and chief \nexecutive officer of Nippon Building Fund Management Ltd., which \nmanages the REIT, said in an interview in November. The amount the \nREIT has spent so far this year is more than three times that.  The capitalization rate, a measure of investment yield, for\noffice properties in Tokyo fell to 5.2 percent in May from a\nrecord high of 5.5 percent in October, according to Real Capital\nAnalytics Inc. A drop in the cap rate, which is a property\u2019s net\nincome divided by the purchase price, usually signals an\nincrease in real estate prices.  1980s Bubble  The number of listed Japanese companies that sold\nproperties in the 12 months ended March 31 rose 20 percent to\n60, the first increase in eight years, amid corporate\nrestructurings and ramped up acquisitions by J-REITs, according\nto  Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd.  Selling prices totaled 305.8\nbillion yen, more than triple the 99.7 billion yen of properties\nsold a year earlier, it said.  Japan \u2019s real estate market was a key part of the asset-price bubble of the 1980s, when economic growth, loose monetary\npolicy and bank lending led to speculation on property and sent\nthe Nikkei 225 Stock Average to its peak in 1989. The Nikkei is\ntwo-thirds off that high and residential land prices in Tokyo\nare one-third of their peak in 1988.  Abe has promised to loosen business regulations and\nincrease government support to help Japan\u2019s industry as part of\nthe \u201cthird arrow\u201d of a three-pronged strategy to end\ndeflation, following fiscal and monetary stimulus.  His plan includes creating incentives to attract foreign\ninvestment and boosting the competitiveness of major cities in\nJapan. The government may also consider relaxing development\nrules in certain zones to meet demand for office buildings and\nresidential space in metropolitan areas, it said.  Attracting Capital  The BOJ, which under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda unveiled a\nplan in April to target a 2 percent inflation rate, has acquired\n138.7 billion yen of REIT shares since December 2010 to help\nsupport the market.  The world\u2019s third-largest economy grew at an annualized 4.1\npercent in the first three months of this year, the fastest\nexpansion in a year, the government said last month.  Investors are responding. AXA Real Estate, a unit of\n Europe \u2019s second-largest insurer, bought two office buildings in\ncentral Tokyo this year for 10 billion yen and plans to double\nthe acquisitions by the end of the year, said Hidetoshi Ono, the\nhead of Japan Core Fund at AXA Real Estate in  Singapore .  \u201cMore and more capital -- domestic and foreign -- is going\nafter real estate,\u201d said Ono. \u201cThe good news is that there are\nmuch more transactions happening this year than last year. The\nbad news is prices are getting higher.\u201d  Retail Properties  Prime retail properties may benefit as  consumer confidence \nincreases, according to Akagi of Jones Lang LaSalle in Tokyo.\nAbe\u2019s plan to increase  government spending  helped bolster\n consumer confidence  in May to the highest level since 2007.  Parco Co. (8251) , a Tokyo-based shopping-center operator, bought\ntwo buildings in Fukuoka City, in southwestern Japan, for 26.5\nbillion yen in March, the company said in a statement. SEB Asset\nManagement, a Frankfurt-based  investment company , said in April\nit sold a mall in Chiba for 100 million euro ($131 million), 13\npercent more than it paid for the property in 2009.  The capitalization rate for retail properties in Tokyo fell\nto 4.2 percent in the second quarter, the lowest since Real\nCapital Analytics started compiling the data in 2009, from 6\npercent in the previous quarter. The cap rate for the same type\nof properties in  Osaka  narrowed to 5.7 percent in the second\nquarter from 7.6 percent three months earlier, it said.  Revenue Forecast  Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802) , Japan\u2019s largest developer by market\nvalue, said revenue generated from its retail space will\nprobably reach a record this fiscal year.  Mitsui Fudosan Co. (8801) ,\nthe biggest developer by sales, said it expects full-year profit\nto rise for the first time in four years, as new malls opened\nduring the reporting period that ended March 31 contribute to\nleasing revenue. Both companies are based in Tokyo.  Mitsui Fudosan was raised to overweight from equal weight\non June 25 by Takashi Hashimoto at Barclays Plc with a target\nprice of 3,400 yen. The shares rose 1.3 percent to 3,225 yen\ntoday in Tokyo. Among 25 analysts who cover Mitsubishi Estate,\n16 have buy recommendations for the stock, while only one\nadvises to sell, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Prime office, commercial and residential properties in\nmajor centers such as Tokyo will probably benefit as more people\nfrom regional areas move to the cities, said billionaire Akira Mori. His Mori Trust Co., the nation\u2019s most profitable closely\nheld developer, may buy more land after it accumulated about\n10,000 tsubo (33,000 square meters or 355,210 square feet) of\nspace in central Tokyo, depending on how well Abe\u2019s growth plan\nis implemented, 76-year-old Mori said in an interview.  Limited Recovery  \u201cLand prices rose across the board during the bubble\nperiod in the 1980s,\u201d said Mori. \u201cThis time, with an inflation\ntarget of 2 percent and economic growth, real estate will\ncertainly benefit. However, unlike the bubble in the \u201980s, the\nrecovery will only be limited to certain areas.\u201d  Some are skeptical that Abe\u2019s policies will attract more\nforeign companies.  \u201cI cannot identify any policy that I think is going to\nlead to any long-term growth, long-term inflation or any\nincrease in demand in  office space  or high rents,\u201d Seth Sulkin,\na representative director at Tokyo-based real estate and asset\nmanager Pacifica Capital KK, said.  A government policy to enable developers to build taller\nbuildings is primarily going to benefit Mitsubishi Estate and\nMitsui Fudosan or other big developers and won\u2019t have any impact\non the overall real estate market, Sulkin said.  Vacancy Rates  Still, the office vacancy rate in Tokyo\u2019s central five\nwards fell for a third month in May to 8.3 percent, according to\nTokyo-based  Miki Shoji Co. (MIKIMT07)  It hit a record a record 9.4 percent\nin June last year.  The vacancy rate rose to 8.46 percent last month as tenants\nleft their current locations to move into new buildings, Miki\nShoji said today.  The number of prime sites throughout Japan where values\nincreased rose to 80 out of 150 locations as of April 1, from 51\nsites three months earlier, according to government data. It was\nthe first time since 2007 that more than half of the places\nrecorded increases.  \u201cTokyo stands out as a bright spot on a global stage when\ninvestors consider where to put their money,\u201d said Akagi of\nJones Lang LaSalle. \u201cIt\u2019s no doubt Abenomics is immensely\npositive for the real estate market and has a huge impact and\nproperty prices.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nKathleen Chu in Tokyo at \n kchu2@bloomberg.net ;\nKatsuyo Kuwako in Tokyo at \n kkuwako@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAndreea Papuc at \n apapuc1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated was 89.92318725585938 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated was ",
