 "context": "The following article called 'Icahn Target Greenbrier Falls as Investors Doubt Deal' was published on 2012-12-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGreenbrier Cos., the target of  Carl Icahn \u2019s  American Railcar Industries Inc. (ARII)  takeover offer, dropped\nthe most in seven weeks amid investor concern a sweetened bid\nfor the railcar maker may fall through.  Greenbrier sank 12 percent to $18.16 at the close in  New\nYork , the steepest one-day drop since Nov. 1. American Railcar\nfell 8 percent to $33.11, the biggest decline since March 12.  American Railcar, which is 56 percent owned by Icahn,\nincreased its bid to $22 a share from $20 and gave Greenbrier\nuntil tomorrow at 2 p.m. to accept or reject the offer.\nGreenbrier called the first bid \u201cgrossly\u201d undervalued.  \u201cThe primary risk to owning the shares at this time is the\npossibility of a rejection of the offer by Greenbrier\u2019s board\nfollowed by Icahn walking away,\u201d Michael Baudendistel, an\nanalyst with Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said in a note today in\nwhich he cut his rating on Greenbrier to hold from buy.  Icahn, who disclosed a 9.99 percent stake in Greenbrier\nlast month, is reviving a takeover bid for the Lake Oswego-based\nrailcar producer that he made and then called off four years\nago. By combining Greenbrier and American Railcar, he would\ncreate the largest U.S. railroad-car maker, surpassing  Trinity\nIndustries Inc. (TRN)   Before today, Greenbrier\u2019s shares had jumped 48 percent\nsince Nov. 12, the day before Icahn disclosed his stake in the\ncompany. Even with that gain, the shares had lost 15 percent\nthis year through Dec. 19.  Greenbrier\u2019s \u2018Missteps\u2019  Greenbrier\u2019s shares have stumbled because the company gave\na \u201cconservative outlook\u201d for next year and has had some\n\u201coperational glitches\u201d that affected profit margins, JB Groh,\nan analyst with D.A. Davidson & Co., said in an interview\nyesterday.  \u201cThey\u2019ve had a couple missteps on the margin front and I\nthink that\u2019s frustrated people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe peak earnings\nare still a couple of years away.\u201d  If American Railcar\u2019s $22 offer is rejected, it\u2019s unlikely\nthere will be another bidder, Baudendistel, the Stifel analyst,\nsaid.  \u201cYesterday\u2019s offer price represents a full and fair value\nfor the company\u2019s shares,\u201d Baudendistel wrote in the note.\n\u201cIcahn walking away from this deal would certainly not be\nunprecedented.\u201d  American Railcar said it was told by Greenbrier\u2019s\ninvestment banker before the initial offer that $20 to $22 was\nan acceptable price. Greenbrier said in a statement on Dec. 18\nthat the $20-a-share offer \u201cgrossly undervalues\u201d the company.  Banker\u2019s Encouragement  \u201cIf Greenbrier\u2019s board does not wish to proceed on this\nbasis, we will move on to other endeavors and abandon any\nefforts to complete a transaction,\u201d  Icahn Enterprises LP (IEP)  Chief\nExecutive Officer Daniel A. Ninivaggi said in the letter to\nGreenbrier CEO William Furman.  Jack Isselmann, a spokesman for Greenbrier, declined to\ncomment on the offer.  In the letter, Ninivaggi said that Greenbrier\u2019s investment\nbanker \u201clast weekend\u201d encouraged him to make an offer and that\nthe board would \u201cseriously entertain\u201d a bid of between $20 and\n$22. He didn\u2019t identify the investment banker. Greenbrier said\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. are its\nfinancial advisers.  \u201cWe would never have made the offer had we not believed\nthat we had your support and the support of a substantial number\nof directors for a transaction in the  price range  we\ndiscussed,\u201d Ninivaggi wrote.
