 "context": "The following article called 'Fernandez Curbing Imports Leaves Argentines Searching in Vain for Fridges' was published on 2012-02-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRetiree Teresa Teffer searched\nbranches of  Argentina \u2019s leading appliance retailers for a fridge\nand oven she\u2019d seen on display less than two months earlier. She\ngave up after finding neither.  \u201cThey have nothing to offer me,\u201d the 71-year-old said as\nshe left an  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  store in  Buenos Aires \u2019s Alto\nAvellaneda shopping mall. \u201cThere are only a couple of lesser-\nknown brands. The government is forcing me to buy what it wants\nand not what I want.\u201d  Consumers face fewer choices in everything from blenders to\ncomputer parts as President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner curbs\n import s to shore up a dwindling trade surplus and protect\nmanufacturers whose competitiveness is suffering from a peso\nthat\u2019s not weakening fast enough to offset  inflation . The\nrestrictions forced automaker  Fiat SpA (F) \u2019s local unit to suspend\nproduction this month and prompted Brazil\u2019s Trade Minister\nFernando Pimentel to say that neighboring Argentina is a\n\u201cpermanent problem.\u201d  In response to the restraints, which are set to tighten\nfurther today, retailers and wholesalers are reducing the\nselection of brands and goods they sell in  South America \u2019s\nsecond-largest economy. Computer parts are among items that are\nbecoming increasingly difficult to obtain, said Oscar Delpino,\n39, who builds and repairs PCs.  \u201cEverything I use is imported, so I have to waste time\ngoing from one supplier to another to find what I need,\u201d\nDelpino, who works from his home in the Buenos Aires suburb of\nColegiales, said in a telephone interview. Sellers also take\nadvantage of scarcities to increase prices, he said.  Replace Imports  Falabella declined to comment, according to Nueva\nComunicacion, which manages press relations for the Santiago-\nbased company.  Industry Minister Debora Giorgi said the government is\ndefending Argentine manufacturers and rejected Pimentel\u2019s\ncharges about the country\u2019s ties with  Brazil , its biggest trade\npartner.  \u201cThe reality of bilateral trade between Argentina and\nBrazil shows we don\u2019t deserve such comments,\u201d Giorgi said in a\nJan. 19 statement. \u201cWe defend our production from unfair\ncompetition.\u201d  Imports from Brazil rose 23 percent last year as Argentina\nbought $5.8 billion more from its neighbor than it exported,\naccording to Giorgi.  Friction between Argentina and Brazil, the biggest members\nof the four-nation Mercosur trade bloc, may rise from today,\nwhen Argentina will require importers to seek authorization from\nthe federal tax agency before purchasing goods abroad.  Special Treatment  The measure will affect about 80 percent of Brazilian\nexports to Argentina and involves about 5,500 Argentine\nimporters, according to the research department of the Sao Paulo\nIndustrial Federation. Its president, Paulo Skaf, said he\u2019s\nseeking special treatment for goods from Brazil given its status\nas a Mercosur member.  \u201cIf we have an industry with containers that are held up\nand need to be shipped, we can\u2019t get into a dispute that\u2019s going\nto take a year to resolve,\u201d Skaf said in a Jan. 20 statement.\nSkaf will meet with Argentine Economy Minister Hernan Lorenzino\ntomorrow in Buenos Aires, officials at the industrial federation\nsaid.  In the past 12 months, the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange\u2019s\nbenchmark  Merval (MERVAL)  index lost 22.4 percent compared with a 5.3\npercent drop in the Sao Paulo  Bovespa (IBOV)  index. Argentina\u2019s  dollar\nbonds  returned 1.2 percent in the same period while Brazil\u2019s\n dollar bonds  returned 14 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase &\nCo.\u2019s EMBI+ indexes.  Debt Default  Blocked from international credit markets since a 2001\ndefault, Argentina relies on a  trade surplus  to build up central\nbank  reserves , which the government uses to pay its foreign debt\nand slow the depreciation of the peso. This year, the peso has\nweakened 0.84 percent against the  U.S. dollar , the only decline\namong the region\u2019s major currencies.  Still, the peso isn\u2019t weakening fast enough for the\nnation\u2019s manufacturers to compete with foreign-made goods. Last\nyear, the currency weakened 7.5 percent while economists\nestimate consumer prices rose about 25 percent, more than double\nthe 9.5 percent reported by the national statistics institute.  \u201cThe government tries to restrict imports with\nbureaucratic barriers,\u201d said Maximiliano Castillo, a former\nmanager of macroeconomic analysis at the central bank, who now\nruns ACM Consultores in Buenos Aires. \u201cThese measures won\u2019t\nreverse the decline in the surplus. More controls won\u2019t solve\nthe problem.\u201d  Narrowing Surplus  Imports rose 11 percent in December from a year earlier,\nthe smallest increase in two years. The  trade surplus , fueled by\ndemand for soybean and automobile exports, narrowed in 2011 for\na second year, falling to $10.3 billion from $11.6 billion. The\nsurplus will decline to $4.5 billion or less this year,\ndepending on the effects of a drought that may cost $2.5 billion\nin lost agricultural exports, said Castillo.  To protect industry and encourage investment, the\ngovernment last year reached accords with sellers of foreign-\nmade cars to match their imports, dollar for dollar, with\nexports. As a result, Porsche importer Nordenwagen SA will ship\nwine and olives, while Bayerische Motoren Werke AG has committed\nto exporting auto parts, upholstery leather and rice.  The shutdown of Fiat\u2019s factory in Cordoba province this\nmonth ended two days after it started when the government agreed\nto expedite approval of the parts the company was trying to\nimport. Giorgi called the unit of Turin-based Fiat\u2019s decision at\nthe time \u201cincomprehensible and small-minded.\u201d  Sales Increase  Sales by  Longvie SA (LONG) , which manufactures stoves, washing\nmachines and other appliances, increased last year, said Chief\nFinancial Officer Ernesto Huergo.  \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how much is due to the economic growth\nand how much is a result of import restrictions,\u201d Huergo said\nin telephone interview from Longvie\u2019s headquarters in Buenos\nAires. The company relies mostly on local suppliers for parts,\nsaid Huergo, who declined to give details of 2011 sales.  The new requirements to get permission ahead of bringing\ngoods into the country will do little to help Argentina\u2019s\nnarrowing trade surplus,  Gabriel Torres , an analyst at Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service Inc. in  New York , wrote in a Jan. 23 report.\nContinued inflation is making the country\u2019s goods uncompetitive,\naccording to Torres.  For Argentina\u2019s 40 million inhabitants, the import\nrestrictions mean less choice and higher prices, said Jose\nLilino, head of the Argentine Federation of Home Appliance\nStores, which represents about 1,400 retail outlets.  Supply Difficulties  Six months ago, Lilino started to sell furniture, gym\nequipment and plates and bowls at his home appliances stores in\nthe province of  Santa Fe  because of difficulties in obtaining\nstocks of imported irons, refrigerators and blenders.  \u201cI\u2019m becoming a seller of whatever I can find to sell,\u201d\nLilino said in a telephone interview from Santa Fe, the\nprovince\u2019s capital.  While the availability of goods has fallen, prices have\nsoared, said Lilino.  \u201cAn iron that cost 50 pesos ($11.5) last year today sells\nfor 120 pesos,\u201d said Lilino. \u201cIt\u2019s the consumer who\u2019s paying\nthe cost of these measures.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nEliana Raszewski in Buenos Aires at \n eraszewski@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJoshua Goodman at \n jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 28.351041793823242 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
