 "context": "The following article called 'Turkey in Talks With Euroclear to Open Lira Bond Market' was published on 2013-03-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTurkey  is in talks with Euroclear\nBank SA to open trading in Turkish debt to international\ninvestors, Istanbul Stock Exchange Chairman Ibrahim Turhan said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve had some contact with senior managers of\nEuroclear\u201d and \u201cwe will have another meeting very soon in\nIstanbul,\u201d Turhan said in an interview at an investment\nconference in Dubai. \u201cThe work is still in progress and very\nsoon we will have a tangible outcome.\u201d  Euroclear, which operates the world\u2019s biggest bond\nsettlement system, began direct clearing of Russian debt last\nmonth, allowing foreign access without the need for a local\nbrokerage account for the first time in a move Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc. estimated may bring as much as $30 billion of\ninflows. Turkey\u2019s government debt at $289 billion is almost\ntwice Russia\u2019s $152 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Turkish benchmark  two-year bonds  were the best performers\nin major  emerging markets  last year, with yields dropping 483\nbasis points, or 4.83 percentage points, as Turkey got its first\ninvestment-grade ranking in 18 years in November from Fitch\nRatings. Yields rose one basis points to 6.18 percent at 5:00\np.m. in Istanbul today, leaving them unchanged for 2013. The\nlira climbed 0.4 percent to 1.8180 per dollar.  Asian Accounts  \u201cThis will surely help to broaden the investor base\nfurther,\u201d  Yarkin Cebeci , an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nin Istanbul, said by e-mail today. \u201cSome of the investors,\nespecially Asian accounts, have been reluctant to have exposure\nin Turkey as Turkish bonds were not Euroclearable.\u201d  Turhan said he hopes talks with Euroclear will be finalized\n\u201cbefore the end of the year.\u201d  \u201cWe are speaking with Turkish officials, but it is too\nearly to provide information on the scope or timeline of any\nlink with Turkey\u2019s local infrastructure,\u201d Stephan Pouyat,\nEuroclear\u2019s head of global reach product management in Brussels,\nsaid in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg.  Euroclear\u2019s impact is unlikely to be as significant as for\nRussia because Turkish debt has higher levels of foreign\nownership, according to Esther Law, a London-based emerging-\nmarket strategist at Societe Generale SA.  Foreign ownership of  Russia \u2019s OFZs will rise to 10 percent\nfrom 6.5 percent in the medium term and to 25 percent in the\nlong term, the Russian Finance Ministry said on its website Dec.\n28. In Turkey, non-residents already hold about 22 percent of\nthe total debt, based on the $64.8 billion the central bank said\nwas held by foreign investors on March 8.  \u201cTurkish government securities are traded very well at an\ninternational level,\u201d Turhan said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the deepest\nmarkets in the world in terms of fixed-income securities and the\nadvantage in Turkey is that government securities are traded at\nthe exchange.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nMahmoud Kassem in Abu Dhabi at \n mkassem1@bloomberg.net ;\nLyubov Pronina in London at \n lpronina@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nGavin Serkin at \n gserkin@bloomberg.net ;\nDale Crofts at \n dcrofts@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 38.49761199951172 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
