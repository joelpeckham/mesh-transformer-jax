 "context": "The following article called 'CP All Slumps Most in 4 Years on $6.6 Billion Siam Makro Bid' was published on 2013-04-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBillionaire Dhanin Chearavanont\u2019s\n CP All Pcl (CPALL)  plunged the most in more than four years after\noffering to pay $6.6 billion for  Siam Makro Pcl (MAKRO)  on investor\nconcern the price was too high.  Thailand\u2019s 7-Eleven operator  fell  as much as 11 percent to\n38.5 baht, poised for the biggest decline since October 2008.\nSiam Makro rose as much as 13 percent to a record.  Dhanin\u2019s offer is the largest Thai deal on record as the\nhead of the country\u2019s biggest agricultural group bids to\nreassemble a retail empire after selling off control of the\ncash-and-carry  chain  he co-founded. He is offering about 53\ntimes Siam Makro\u2019s earnings last year, more than double the\naverage for 20 retailer takeovers in emerging Asia announced\nover the last five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cCP All is paying a very expensive price,\u201d said\nThananchai Jittanoon, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Securities\n( Thailand ) Pcl. \u201cThe two companies have different markets and\nbusiness models. I find no synergy for CP at all.\u201d  CP All, controlled by Dhanin\u2019s Charoen Pokphand Group,\noffered 787 baht a share for Siam Makro, the Bangkok-based\nretailer said yesterday. The bid is 15 percent more than Siam\nMakro\u2019s price on April 22 before the shares were suspended.  Buying Spree  Dhanin is buying companies at home and abroad, accounting\nfor more than half of the record $31 billion in total deals\nannounced this year in Thailand, including CP Group\u2019s purchase\nof a $9.4 billion stake in  China \u2019s Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.  Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (SCB)  is advising CP All on the Siam\nMakro acquisition, and HSBC Holdings Plc is advising SHV\nHoldings NV, the wholesaler\u2019s biggest shareholder.  The CP All chairman, who lists cockfighting as a hobby, has\na net worth of $6.8 billion, according to the  Bloomberg\nBillionaires Index . Many of his assets are owned through closely\nheld holding companies that he shares with his three brothers.\nDhanin\u2019s net worth calculation excludes the stakes held by his\nbrothers, Jaran Chiaravanont, Montri Jiaravanont and Sumet\nJiaravanon.  CP All had cash and cash equivalents of 6.1 billion baht\n($212 million) as of Dec. 31, according to yesterday\u2019s\nstatement. The company got a $6 billion bridge loan from five\nbanks to fund the purchase, two people familiar with the matter\nsaid yesterday.  The retailer will refinance that within a year through\nsyndicated finance, bonds and possibly equity, said the people,\nwho asked not to be identified because the information is\nprivate.  Possible Dilution  \u201cUncertainty on the degree of earnings dilution from a\ncash call to finance the acquisition,\u201d undermines investor\nappetite for CP All, Alan Richardson, a Hong Kong-based fund\nmanager who helps oversee about $110 billion for Samsung Asset\nManagement Co., said yesterday. His Samsung ASEAN Securities\nMaster Investment Trust beat 98 percent of his rivals in the\npast year.  Siam Makro operated 57 Makro stores and five Siam Frozen\nstores at the end of 2012. It opened five new Makro stores last\nyear, helping to boost annual revenue by 15 percent to 112\nbillion baht, the company said on Feb. 27. The Bangkok-based\ncompany\u2019s profit rose 37 percent to 3.56 billion baht in 2012.  CP All and  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  are adding outlets in Thailand after\nthe government raised minimum wages and introduced price\nguarantees for farmers. Demand for personal loans jumped 22\npercent in 2012, the biggest increase in seven years, as Thai\nconsumers took advantage of government incentives to buy new\ncars and homes  Chain Growth  CP All said last year it may open 7-Eleven stores in\nsouthern China and  Vietnam . Earlier this month, Dhanin said he\u2019s\nseeking more acquisitions in China.  \u201cThe CP leadership possibly sees strong growth prospects\nin Asean to warrant paying up in the first few years to extract\nbenefits later on,\u201d said Richardson at Samsung Asset, referring\nto the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \u201cMaybe\nhe\u2019s trying to create a Wal-mart model, squeeze the suppliers\nuntil they can\u2019t breathe.\u201d  Big C Supercenter Pcl (BIGC) , Thailand\u2019s second-largest\nhypermarket operator, jumped 4.3 percent to 242 baht, headed for\na record close, as of 10:47 a.m. in Bangkok. The shares rose 7.4\npercent yesterday amid speculation investors seeking retailers\nin the country would prefer it to CP All.  \u201cSome investors still wanted to stay invested in the Thai\ndomestic consumption theme, but have soured on CP All after this\ndeal, which was viewed as bad for CP All\u2019s shareholders,\u201d\nAthaporn Arayasantiparb, head of research at UOB Kay Hian\nSecurities (Thailand), said yesterday.  Biggest Deal  CP All\u2019s Siam Makro offer tops the $5.5 billion purchase of\nPTT Aromatics & Refining Pcl by PTT Chemical Pcl in 2011 to\nbecome the largest on record in Thailand, data compiled by\nBloomberg show.  Dhanin and SHV founded Siam Makro in 1988, according to the\ncompany\u2019s website. CP All agreed to buy SHV\u2019s 64 percent stake\nfor 787 baht a share and will make a tender offer to other\nshareholders at the same price, it said.  Charoen Pokphand was once Siam Makro\u2019s largest shareholder\nwith a stake of as much as 47 percent in 1997, the same year\nthat the devaluation of Thailand\u2019s baht triggered a financial\ncrisis that pushed many Asian economies into recession.  After the crisis, Dhanin sold stakes in companies including\nSiam Makro and Lotus Supercenter, which was bought by Tesco. In\nMay 2005, a Charoen Pokphand unit sold 7 percent of Siam Makro\nback to the company that controlled the retailer for 60 baht per\nshare. The group still owns about 1 percent of Siam Makro.
