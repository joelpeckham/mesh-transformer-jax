The Hong Kong-listed casino operator\u2019s net income more than\ntripled to HK$3 billion ($387 million) in 2011, according a\nstatement to the local stock exchange today, missing the HK$3.1\nbillion average of 10  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg\nNews. The board doesn\u2019t recommend the payment of a final\ndividend for the year ended December, it said.  Casino companies including  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,  MGM China\nHoldings Ltd (2282) . and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL)  have reported\nincome gains fueled by rising tourism to Macau, the world\u2019s\nbiggest gambling hub and the only place in  China  where gambling\nis legal. Sands in January said it will pay its first dividend\nbecause it has enough cash to fund expansion plans.  Net income was \u201ca little disappointing\u201d as the company\nwrote down the value of convertible bonds, said Edwin Fan, an\nanalyst at BOC International. \u201cThe market was also let down by\nno dividend payout,\u201d he said.  Goldman Sachs in January named Galaxy as among the casino\noperators most likely to raise or begin paying dividends. Galaxy\nwill invest funds in projects instead of paying out cash to\nshareholders, Deputy Chairman Francis Lui said in August.  \u201cWe are a growth company and we have the largest approved\n land bank  in Cotai so we think it\u2019s in our shareholders best\ninterest to reinvest the capital,\u201d Chief Financial Officer\n Robert Drake  said in an interview today.  Permira Investment  Gaming revenue in the first quarter is set to meet or\nexceed sales in the fourth quarter and will grow in the \u201chigh\nteens\u201d this year, he estimated. He didn\u2019t provide a timeframe\nfor when the company would start the second phase of development\nof a Cotai project.  Revenue at the company, which opened the Galaxy Macau\nresort at Cotai in May, more than doubled to HK$41.2 billion in\n2011.

Private equity firm Permira Advisers LLP is a long-term\ninvestor of Galaxy and has no plan to reduce its investment in\nthe company in the short term, Deputy Chairman Francis Lui said\nat a press conference in  Hong Kong  today. Permira sold some\nGalaxy shares at a discount last year.  Rising Competition  Competition has heated up in Macau as new casinos are\nopened. Gambling revenue in the former Portuguese colony last\nyear climbed 42 percent to 268 billion patacas ($34 billion).
