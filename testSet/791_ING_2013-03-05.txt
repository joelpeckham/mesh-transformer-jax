 "context": "The following article called 'Scotiabank Quarterly Profit Climbs 13% on Consumer Banking' was published on 2013-03-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,  Canada \u2019s third-\nlargest lender, said quarterly profit climbed 13 percent as its\nING Direct acquisition improved consumer-banking results. The\nfirm also increased its quarterly dividend.  Net income for the fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 31 rose\nto C$1.63 billion ($1.58 billion), or C$1.25 a share, from\nC$1.44 billion, or C$1.20, a year earlier, the Toronto-based\nbank said today in a statement. Excluding one-time items,\nScotiabank earned C$1.27 a share, beating the C$1.25 average\n estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Domestic banking profit climbed 21 percent to C$574 million\nafter the lender purchased the Canadian operations of  ING Groep\nNV (INGA)  for C$3.1 billion in November. Scotiabank joined Royal Bank\nof Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank in posting higher first-\nquarter net income even as Canada\u2019s economic growth began to\nstagnate on record levels of household debt.  \u201cSome pundits were calling for a slowdown, but we really\nhaven\u2019t seen it yet,\u201d said  Ian Nakamoto , director of research\nat MacDougall MacDougall & MacTier Inc. in Toronto, which\nmanages about C$4 billion in assets, including bank shares.\n\u201cPersonal and commercial banking is still the bread-and-butter\nfor these banks.\u201d  The lender raised its quarterly dividend 5.3 percent to 60\ncents per share. Scotiabank was expected to boost the payout to\n59 cents, according to Bloomberg Dividend Projections.  International Bank  Scotiabank gained 0.7 percent to close at C$61.32 in\nToronto. The shares have climbed 6.7 percent this year, compared\nwith the 4.8 percent advance of the 10-company  Standard &\nPoor\u2019s/TSX Banks Index. (STBANKX)   Profit from international banking increased 19 percent to\nC$466 million, helped by Scotiabank\u2019s acquisition last year of\nBanco Colpatria in Colombia. The lender has operations in more\nthan 50 countries, including Mexico, Thailand and  Peru .  Profit from investment banking rose 28 percent to C$399\nmillion from a year earlier, while the wealth-management unit\nposted a 7.6 percent gain to C$310 million.  \u201cIt was a very solid quarter for BNS, reflecting solid\norganic revenue growth across the operating segments augmented\nby select acquisitions,\u201d Brad Smith, an analyst with Stonecap\nSecurities Inc. in Toronto, wrote today in a note to clients.  Scotiabank was the last of Canada\u2019s six largest banks by\nassets to report first-quarter results. Royal Bank, the nation\u2019s\nlargest, said profit rose 12 percent to C$2.07 billion.  Toronto-\nDominion (TD) , the second-biggest, reported profit climbed 21 percent\nto C$1.79 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSean B.
