The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEuropean stocks  posted the biggest\nweekly drop since September as  Greece  moved closer to a possible\nexit from the euro and concern mounted that Spanish banks will\nneed rescue.  A  gauge of lenders  slumped for the third week, as  Banco\nEspirito Santo SA (BES)  lost the most since at least 1993. Bankia SA\nlost 15 percent.  Opap SA (OPAP)  closed in Athens trading with the\nbiggest slide since it sold shares to the public in 2001, after\nfirst-quarter profit decreased 21 percent.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 5.2 percent to 238.88 this\nweek. The gauge has tumbled 12 percent since this year\u2019s high on\nMarch 16 as Greek leaders failed to form a government after\nelections, squabbling over austerity measures.  \u201cThe markets are signaling a risk-off attitude and signs\nof fatigue regarding the question about what to do with Greece\nare evident,\u201d said Ben Hauzenberger, a Zurich-based  fund\nmanager  at Swisscanto Asset Management AG, which oversees $53\nbillion. \u201cInvestors are wondering what will happen to the euro\nin the case of a Greek exit and which countries could follow in\nits footsteps.\u201d  National benchmark indexes fell in all the 18 western\nEuropean markets this week. The U.K.\u2019s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  declined 5.5\npercent. France\u2019s CAC 40 lost 3.9 percent and Germany\u2019s DAX slid\n4.7 percent. Greece\u2019s ASE Index plunged 10 percent.  Greek Deadlock  Greece\u2019s President Karolos Papoulias failed to secure\nagreement on a unity government that could have avoided new\nelections. He swore in a caretaker government led by Panagiotis Pikrammenos.  The new vote, set for June 17, follows inconclusive\nelections that propelled the Syriza group, which opposes\nausterity measures required for an international bailout, into\nsecond place. Most opinion polls have suggested that Syriza may\nbuild on that support in the rerun.  \u201cIf Greece -- and this is the will of the great majority -\n- wants to stay in the euro, then they have to accept the\nconditions,\u201d German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said in\nBrussels on May 15. \u201cOtherwise it isn\u2019t possible. No\nresponsible candidate can hide that from the electorate.\u201d  Greece\u2019s credit rating was downgraded one level to CCC from\nB- by  Fitch Ratings  on May 17.  Separately, the  European Central Bank  said it suspended\nlending to some Greek banks to limit its risk. President  Mario Draghi  signaled the ECB won\u2019t compromise on key principles to\nkeep Greece in the euro area.  Spanish Downgrades  Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded 16 Spanish banks on\nMay 17, citing the nation\u2019s recession, reduced funding access\nfor lenders and deterioration in loan quality that will spread\nbeyond real estate to household and company loans.  Spain\u2019s borrowing costs rose at its bond auction that day\nas it sold the maximum amount of notes targeted and its 10-year\nbond yields approached levels that drove Greece and Portugal\ninto bailouts.  Spanish Deputy Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre\ndenied speculation that  Bankia (BKIA) , the lender with the biggest\ndomestic asset base, was seeing a deposit flight. Bankia said in\na regulatory filing that changes in the deposit level in the\nfirst half of May \u201chave a substantially seasonal nature\u201d and\nthat it doesn\u2019t expect \u201csubstantial changes\u201d in coming days.  Euro-Area Economy  Elsewhere, a report showed that  gross domestic product  in\nthe 17-nation euro area stagnated in the first quarter compared\nwith the final three months of 2011, according to the European\nUnion\u2019s statistics office in Luxembourg.

Germany\u2019s economy  expanded 0.5 percent, compared\nwith the 0.1 percent median estimate of economists in a separate\nsurvey.  Banco Espirito Santo sank 22 percent, as the Stoxx 600\nBanks Index tumbled 8.7 percent.  Bankia plunged 15 percent after El Mundo reported that\ncustomers have withdrawn 1 billion euros ($1.27 billion) since\nMay 9, when the government said it will take over the bank. The\nSpanish lender also said provisions for soured property loans\nwill be 115 times last year\u2019s earnings.

Opap, Europe\u2019s biggest listed  gambling company , retreated\n27 percent, the most since at least May 2001, after first-\nquarter profit fell 21 percent on higher net-interest expenses\nand lower sales.  Separately, Imerisia reported that the company\u2019s agents\nhave asked for a 30 percent commission on gross winnings from\nplanned video lottery terminal games.
