 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Payroll Gain Caps Best Six-Month Job Growth Streak Since \u201906: Economy' was published on 2012-03-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEmployers in the U.S. boosted\npayrolls more than forecast in February, capping the best six-\nmonth streak of job growth since 2006 and sending stocks higher.  The 227,000 increase followed a revised 284,000 gain in\nJanuary that was bigger than first estimated, Labor Department\nfigures showed today in  Washington . The median projection of\neconomists in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 210,000 rise.\nThe  jobless rate  held at 8.3 percent, even as 476,000 more\nworkers sought employment.  More jobs are helping fuel the wage gains that drive\n consumer spending , which accounts for about 70 percent of the\neconomy. The latest pickup in employment bolsters President\n Barack Obama \u2019s bid for re-election, while it may not be enough\nto satisfy Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who last\nweek said the job market remains \u201cfar from normal\u201d and\nrepeated that borrowing costs will probably remain low through\nlate 2014.  \u201cThe labor market has found its legs in the last few\nmonths, and it looks like there\u2019s enough of a broad base that\nthe momentum can be sustained,\u201d said  Julia Coronado , chief\neconomist for  North America  at BNP Paribas in  New York , who\nprojected a 225,000 gain in payrolls. \u201cThis leaves the Fed in a\nbit of limbo, as it\u2019s not strong enough to convince them that\nwe\u2019re about to accelerate to much stronger rates of economic\ngrowth.\u201d  Stocks Climb  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to\n1,370.87 at the close in New York. The yield on the benchmark\n10-year Treasury note climbed to 2.03 percent from 2.01 percent\nlate yesterday.  Some 1.2 million jobs were created in the past six months,\nthe most since the same period ended May 2006. Revisions added a\ntotal of 61,000 jobs to payrolls in December and January.  Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said he sees signs of a rebound in consumer spending\nthat would help improve earnings at the second-biggest U.S.\nlender.  \u201cThe American consumer is healing,\u201d Moynihan, 52, said in\nan interview that aired on Bloomberg Television today. \u201cThere\u2019s\nstill an unemployment problem, we all have to work to solve\nthat. But this economy is much better than it was six months ago\nor six months before that. It just keeps feeling better.\u201d  Sold Assets  Bank of America sold $33 billion in assets and announced\n30,000 job cuts last year as Moynihan sought to trim expenses in\nline with stagnant revenue.  A separate report today from the Commerce Department showed\nthe  trade deficit  widened in January to the largest since\nOctober 2008 as imports rose to a record.  The gap increased 4.3 percent to $52.6 billion from a\nrevised $50.4 billion in December. The median estimate of\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a deficit of\n$49 billion in January. Exports of capital goods, as well as\ncars and automobile parts, climbed to a record.  The U.S. unemployment rate, derived from a separate survey\nof households, was forecast to remain at 8.3 percent, according\nto the survey median. The jobless rate held steady even as the\nsurvey showed the  labor force  grew. Employment climbed by\n428,000 in February, while the labor force rose by 476,000.  Circuit Breakers  \u201cThere is hiring going on,\u201d Richard Fearon, chief\nfinancial officer at  Eaton Corp. (ETN)  said at a March 6 industrial\nconference in New York. The Cleveland-based maker of circuit\nbreakers and truck transmissions will \u201cdefinitely need more\nmanpower to serve\u201d growing demand for tractor-trailers and for\nthe equipment used in construction and hydraulics, he said.  The participation rate, which indicates the share of\nworking-age people in the labor force, rose to 63.9 percent from\n63.7 percent.  Private payrolls, which exclude government agencies, rose\n233,000 in February after a revised gain of 285,000 the prior\nmonth that made it the biggest increase since February 2006.\nThey were projected to climb by 225,000. Manufacturing payrolls\nincreased by 31,000 after a revised 52,000 gain.  Even with the \u201cpositive developments\u201d in the job market,\nBernanke told lawmakers last week the \u201cmodest and uneven\u201d\nexpansion needs the support of monetary policy. The central bank\nsaid in January that economic conditions are likely to warrant\nlow  interest rates  at least through late 2014.  March 13 Meeting  Policy makers meeting on March 13 are likely to repeat that\nview while refraining from any additional easing measures, say\neconomists, including  Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond\nJames & Associates Inc. in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida .  The Commerce Department last week reported the economy grew\nat a 3 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter after a 1.8\npercent gain in the prior three months.  \u201cThe  unemployment rate  remains elevated, long-term\nunemployment is still near record levels and the number of\npersons working part time for economic reasons is very high,\u201d\nBernanke said during a Feb. 29 testimony to Congress. Fed policy\nmakers judge \u201cthat sustaining a highly accommodative stance for\nmonetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives\u201d\nfor stable prices and maximum employment, he said.  Employment at service-providers increased 203,000. Retail\npayrolls fell 7,400 in February. Professional and business\nservice employment increased 82,000 last month, including a\n45,200 pickup in temporary hiring.  Education, Health  Education and health services employment jumped 71,000, the\nmost since September 2006, according the Labor Department.  Construction companies reduced payrolls by 13,000 workers\nlast month, the biggest drop since January 2011.  Government payrolls decreased by 6,000 in February,\nreflecting cutbacks at the federal and state levels.  Average hourly earnings rose 0.1 percent to $23.31, today\u2019s\nreport showed. The workweek for all employees averaged 34.5\nhours for a third consecutive month.  The so-called  underemployment rate , which includes part-\ntime workers who\u2019d prefer a full-time position and people who\nwant work but have given up looking, decreased to a three-year\nlow of 14.9 percent from 15.1 percent.  The report also showed a decrease in long-term unemployed\nAmericans. The number of people without a job for 27 weeks or\nmore fell as a percentage of all jobless, to 42.6 percent from\n42.9 percent.
