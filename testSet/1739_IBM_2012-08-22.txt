 "context": "The following article called 'Augusta\u2019s Hootie Johnson Says He Tapped Moore to End Female Ban' was published on 2012-08-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWilliam \u201cHootie\u201d Johnson, who once\nvowed that Augusta National Golf Club wouldn\u2019t admit women even\n\u201cif I drop dead this second,\u201d said he personally nominated one\nof the club\u2019s first two female members.  Johnson, 81, former chairman of the private club in Augusta,\n Georgia , that hosts the  Masters Tournament , said the official\nnomination of Darla Moore came from him.  \u201cYes,\u201d Johnson said in a telephone interview yesterday\nfrom his home in Columbia, South Carolina. \u201cShe has a long\nconnection with me. I\u2019ve had her as a guest at the club a number\nof times along with her husband. She\u2019s a sweet lady.\u201d  Johnson, who was succeeded as the club\u2019s chairman in 2006\nby  Billy Payne , remains active in Augusta National decisions\nwhile serving as chairman emeritus.  The Masters is the first of golf\u2019s four annual major\ntournaments and draws the largest U.S. television audiences in\nthe sport.  Moore, 58, and  Condoleezza Rice , 57, the former U.S.\nSecretary of State, were announced two days ago as the newest\nmembers of the 80-year-old club, which also counts  Bill Gates \nand  Warren Buffett  in its roster.  Johnson and Moore, both graduates of the University of\nSouth Carolina, have been friendly since the late 1990s, when\nJohnson was in charge of the school\u2019s $300 million capital\ncampaign. Moore, the wife of billionaire investor Richard Rainwater, has donated more than $70 million to the university\u2019s\nbusiness school, which was named after her in 1998.  Front Page  Johnson said he remembers the moment when he decided to\napproach Moore for a donation to the school. She was on the\ncover of a 1997 Fortune magazine for an article titled, \u201cThe\nToughest Babe in Business.\u201d  \u201cI went over to talk to the guy at the university who was\nheading up the campaign and I was looking through Fortune while\nI was waiting to see him,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe guy gave me a\nlist of four or five names where we might get big money. I told\nhim, \u2018I can\u2019t get big money from these people, I know them all,\nbut we might get a big gift from this lady right here.\u2019 So I\nwent to see her.\u201d  Moore, who graduated from  South Carolina  in 1975, is the\nleading female benefactor of a business school, according to the\nuniversity\u2019s website.  Johnson said he has played golf with Moore and described\nher ability on the course as \u201cvery good.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t\nelaborate on the process of nominating Moore or Rice.  \u201cThat\u2019s a club matter that I\u2019m not going to discuss,\u201d\nJohnson said.  Payne Politics  Johnson\u2019s participation reflects Payne\u2019s political skill in\nbringing change to Augusta National, said Marcia Chambers, whose\n2002 article on the club\u2019s all-male membership in Golf for Women,\nentitled \u201cLadies Need Not Apply,\u201d touched off the campaign led\nby Martha Burk to push for female members.  \u201cIt\u2019s clear he got Hootie involved in the process, and\nthat was crucial,\u201d Chambers said in a telephone interview.  Others in the club weren\u2019t aware of the decision ahead of\ntime, according to two longtime members who said they learned\nabout it from the media. They spoke anonymously because the club\ntold members not to talk to reporters. Existing members are\ntypically notified of new members in a letter after they have\nbeen accepted.  The decision to disclose the newest members in a public\nstatement is a change from the longstanding tradition of not\ndiscussing private matters. The club, which opened in 1932, has\nnever before publicly acknowledged the names of its members.  \u2018Deliberate\u2019 Consideration  \u201cWe are fortunate to consider many qualified candidates\nfor membership at Augusta National,\u201d Payne said in an e-mailed\nstatement on Aug. 20. \u201cConsideration with regard to any\ncandidate is deliberate, held in strict confidence and always\ntakes place over an extended period of time. The process for\nCondoleezza and Darla was no different.\u201d  The addition of Rice and Moore follows almost a decade of\nscrutiny of Augusta\u2019s all-male membership. In 2002, Johnson\nsparked the debate when he responded to requests from Burk,\nthen-chairwoman of the National Council of Women\u2019s Organizations,\nto add female members by saying the club wouldn\u2019t admit a woman\n\u201cat the point of a bayonet.\u201d The issue led Burk to stage a\nsmall protest during the 2003 Masters.  Johnson, flanked by Payne, opened his annual pre-Masters\nnews conference that year by saying there \u201cmay well come a time\nwhen we include women\u201d and that the club was very comfortable\nwith its all-male status. After being pressed on the subject,\nJohnson ended the gathering with a more decisive stance.  \u201cI do want to make one point, though,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\ndrop dead, right now, our position will not change on this issue.\nIt\u2019s not my issue alone. And I promise you what I\u2019m saying is,\nif I drop dead this second, our position will not change.\u201d  Women\u2019s Membership  Asked yesterday if he was relieved to have the issue of\nwomen\u2019s membership behind him, Johnson declined to comment.  \u201cI continue to be very happy with Augusta National,\u201d\nJohnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not going beyond that.\u201d  Augusta National faced renewed scrutiny this year over its\nlack of female members amid questions about a possible\ninvitation to Ginni Rometty, chief executive officer of\n International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)   Rometty, who became the first female CEO in IBM\u2019s 100-year\nhistory in January, didn\u2019t join Rice and Moore as a member.\nAugusta National historically has invited the CEO of IBM to join\nthe club, including the company\u2019s four previous chief executives.  Johnson\u2019s unwillingness to discuss private matters or\ndetails about the club\u2019s decision to invite Moore and Rice is\nstandard practice, according to former Atlanta Mayor  Andrew Young , who had discussions with the club leading up to the 1996\nOlympics. Payne unsuccessfully attempted to have golf added to\nthe Olympic schedule that year, with the intention of staging\nthe competition at Augusta National.  \u201cOne of the things I\u2019ve learned about Augusta, if you want\nto deal with Hootie Johnson, you have to do it privately,\u201d\nYoung said in a telephone interview. \u201cAugusta thinks it\u2019s the\nVatican of golf and you don\u2019t pressure the Pope. That doesn\u2019t\nmean they don\u2019t respond to pressure.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nMike Buteau in Atlanta at \n mbuteau@bloomberg.net   John Helyar in Atlanta at \n jhelyar@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nMichael Sillup at \n msillup@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was 134.3059844970703 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was ",
