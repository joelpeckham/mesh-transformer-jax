 "context": "The following article called 'Wall Street Kept Winning on Mortgages Upending Homeowners' was published on 2012-11-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRebecca Black abandoned her dream house on Hazelwood Road in  Memphis ,  Tennessee , in 2010, a year after the  recession  ended.  As the  U.S. economy  grew, Black\u2019s world shrank. Today she rents an apartment about the size of her old living room and works for the same $12 an hour she\u2019s earned for years.  If Thomas F. Marano takes a late lunch, he makes more money in a single morning than Black does all year. Marano once led the team at Bear Stearns Cos. that bought Black\u2019s mortgage in 2005 and thousands of other subprime loans to sell to investors.  During the 2000s housing boom, they both won -- Black got a home and Marano made millions.  In the aftermath of the longest economic downturn since the Great Depression, only one of them kept winning. The biggest lenders are doing better than ever while those with the least, many of them black borrowers, are struggling the most. One dividing line for this widening gap is the dotted one where millions of home buyers signed their names to loans they couldn\u2019t repay. With the dream of home ownership snatched away, they and their communities may never be the same.  \u201cIt\u2019s completely not fair,\u201d says Tomeka R. Hart, president of  Memphis Urban League Inc.  and a Shelby County school board member. \u201cIt speaks to a kind of injustice where people at the top are winning out against people at the bottom.\u201d  Abandoning Graceland  Four million U.S. homeowners have lost their homes to foreclosure since June 2009, when the 19-month U.S. recession ended, according to RealtyTrac Inc. Few places have felt the pain more than Rebecca Black\u2019s hometown of Memphis. In the residential blocks around  Elvis Presley \u2019s home, Graceland, 30 percent of the houses are empty or visibly in need of repair, compared with 22 percent in 2009, according to the Center for Community Building and Neighborhood Action at the University of Memphis.  \u201cYou see rows and rows of single-family homes that have been abandoned, not just in the so-called ghetto but everywhere in the city,\u201d says Memphis Mayor A C Wharton Jr. \u201cHome ownership was beginning to catch on with people who never dreamed of it. Just when they got their hands on the ladder to pull themselves up, it turned out they bought more house than they could afford and some had  interest rates  they didn\u2019t know they\u2019d agreed to pay. And it was over.\u201d  Memphis had the highest concentration of subprime mortgages among the 20 biggest U.S. cities in June, based on data from the National Association of Realtors. Subprime loans have higher interest rates and were given to borrowers with bad or no credit.  Predatory Lending  Lenders were 3\u00bd times more likely to steer blacks to high-interest mortgages than whites with comparable credit scores, according to a Center for Responsible Lending  study  of 27 million loans originated from 2004 to 2008. In Memphis, where 63 percent of the 652,000 residents are black, officials say their city was targeted for such predatory lending -- a practice that Marano says his company didn\u2019t engage in.  \u201cBear Stearns had rigorous compliance policies in place to prevent predatory lending and unfair mortgage practices,\u201d Marano says in an e-mail.  Marano, 51, whose fellow 1983 Columbia University graduate was a transfer student named  Barack Obama , left Bear Stearns in 2008, the year it became burdened by defaulting subprime loans and collapsed. He now works as chief executive officer of a mortgage company called Residential Capital LLC, or ResCap, which filed for  bankruptcy protection  in May. Marano received $8 million in compensation last year, an 8 percent raise from 2010.  Black, a 64-year-old Army veteran who works feeding, bathing and dressing a man crippled by  Lou Gehrig \u2019s disease, made about $24,000 in 2011, the same amount listed on her 2005 mortgage application.  Earnings Gap  The earnings gap between the richest Americans and the rest of the country grew to its widest point in more than four decades last year, based on U.S. Census Bureau data. The 1.2 million households whose incomes ranked them in the top 1 percent saw their pay rise 5.5 percent last year, while incomes fell 1.7 percent for the 96 million households in the bottom 80 percent -- those that made less than about $100,000 a year.  The fates of Black and Marano show how the 7.2 percent expansion of the U.S. economy over the last 3\u00bd years has mostly been an economic recovery for the already well-off. Hard times still plague neighborhoods such as Hazelwood Road in southwest Memphis, where Black bought the three-bedroom brick house for $61,750 in May 2005.  Nine of the 15 parcels on Black\u2019s side of the street have houses that sit empty, have been bulldozed flat or have been overtaken by vegetation growing as thick as a wall. Five of them were abandoned after the recession ended, public records show.  \u201cThis used to be a pretty neighborhood,\u201d Black says.  Backyard Barbecues  Neighbors tended gardens and barbecued in their back yards, she says. Black and her teenage sons, Major and Chris, took turns mowing the grass. They used a stepladder to trim the hedges and patch the leaky roof, and when the air conditioner broke down, Black scraped together the money to fix it.  Returning for the first time since moving out, Black points to a dark dent in the wood beneath an eave where water is getting in. The hedges are haywire, and thieves have ripped out the cooling unit. The window that Major once climbed through because he didn\u2019t have his key and the door that Chris used to bang shut -- plywood is nailed over them now.  \u201cI was crazy about this house, so proud,\u201d Black says, placing her palm on the board that covers the hole that was once her front door. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have enough money.\u201d  She points to the brick house next door, surrounded by dead grass. Her neighbor used to wave hello from the shaded concrete porch, she says. He died in 2007. No one lives there now. Whitewashed plywood covers the windows and doors.  Dark Hieroglyphs  To the west, a house sits on a rise, shaded by trees. Black remembers residents hauling in mattresses and a sofa. Now she notices dark hieroglyphs scribbled on the yellow siding. Gang graffiti, she says. Plywood there, too.  Across the street is another boarded-up house. Three doors over, stapled to a porch post is a notice: The property is for sale to settle  unpaid taxes . On the next block, more hollow shells, one of them a half-charred skeleton, and on King Road, behind Hazelwood, more deserted properties, more plywood.  When she hears that in March, a 28-year-old man was shot and killed while driving a pickup truck just steps away from where she\u2019s standing, she blurts, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that!\u201d She shields her eyes from the hazy smudge of sun and looks toward the house marred by gang graffiti. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised,\u201d she says softly.  Holistic Veterinarian  Thomas Marano has owned at least two houses in  Madison, New Jersey , where the Main Street commercial district features brick- and masonry-fronted bistros, wine shops and a holistic veterinarian. Commuters can hop on  New Jersey Transit  at the train station, built in 1916 of rough-hewn gray stones and registered as an historic site, and be in  New York City  in about an hour.  Marano bought a home on busy Shunpike Road in March 2002 for $580,000 and sold it to Oldpike Associates LLC for less than $100 in November 2002, according to  County of Morris Tax Board  records. He\u2019s listed as chief executive officer of Oldpike Associates in public records and his children are identified as members, or shareholders.  Wealthy people sometimes transfer their assets to limited liability companies so their heirs can avoid paying estate taxes or to protect the assets if they get sued, says Y. David Scharf, a partner with Morrison Cohen LLP in  New York  who was speaking generally and doesn\u2019t represent Marano.  Marano is a defendant in \u201cfive or six\u201d securities lawsuits, says Joel C. Haims, a partner with  Morrison & Foerster LLP  in New York who does represent him.  Indoor Pool  A 10-minute walk up the hill from Shunpike, at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac, a for-sale sign sits in front of a five-bedroom home with a heated indoor swimming pool and sauna.  Marano and his then-wife, Amy Ullrich, bought the home in July 1995 for $805,000, public records show. Marano sold his stake to Ullrich in March for less than $100.  Today\u2019s  list price : $1.4 million.  In Madison, whose 16,000 residents are 87 percent white and 3 percent black, the median home price was $641,400 in 2010, according to the census.  The median home price in Memphis was $90,500 in September, according to the  Memphis Area Association of Realtors .  Home prices  are down about $3.5 billion, or 18 percent, since 2009, data from the census and the Realtors\u2019 group show.  Empty Row  Home values have fallen by half in Memphis\u2019s Frayser neighborhood, where Steve Lockwood checks out rehab candidates in his pickup truck. On Sunny View Drive, in the northernmost part of town, 10 houses in a row sit empty, their yards a mess of weeds.  Lockwood, 63, is executive director of the  Frayser Community Development Corp. , a non-profit group that has renovated nearly 100 abandoned homes in the last decade.  \u201cI\u2019m proud of what my people do and what we\u2019ve accomplished because we\u2019ve accomplished a lot,\u201d Lockwood says. \u201cBut we\u2019re getting our a--es kicked. We\u2019re winning a lot of battles but we\u2019re losing the war.\u201d  Predatory lending contributes to the suffering, says Phyllis G. Betts, founding director of the Center for Community Building and Neighborhood Action at the University of Memphis.  Complaint Settled  In May, Memphis and Shelby County settled a predatory lending complaint they\u2019d filed against  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , with the bank pledging $7.5 million to help borrowers with down payments and home renovations. The San Francisco-based lender admitted no wrongdoing, and says it strictly prohibits discrimination based on race, age or other demographic factors.  After reaching the settlement, Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, set a record in the third quarter of 2012 with $4.9 billion in  net income . Over the last four quarters, its profit was greater than that of Walt Disney Co., McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Boeing Co. combined.  Since January 2009, Wells Fargo has forgiven more than $5.5 billion of mortgage principal for customers facing financial hardship, says Vickee J. Adams, the bank\u2019s vice president for external communications.  \u201cWe are committed to putting people in homes and helping them stay there,\u201d Adams says.  Predatory lending has been devastating to the black middle class, says Webb A. Brewer, an attorney with  Brewer & Barlow Plc  in Memphis who helped represent the city in its Wells Fargo lawsuit. \u201cIt\u2019s not hyperbole to say that this is one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time.\u201d  No Tricks  In 2007, two years into paying her mortgage, Black says her $502 monthly bill went up. She says she thought she\u2019d gotten a fixed-rate loan and complained to Marcus L. Gibbs, her mortgage broker.  Gibbs, in an interview, says he remembers it was difficult to get Black a loan because she paid everything in cash and didn\u2019t have a credit history. Her loan documents say she signed a  variable-rate mortgage . Black paid $13,519.63 in fees, the documents say.  \u201cI thought it was a fair loan,\u201d Gibbs says. \u201cI didn\u2019t trick her or anything. I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d  BayRock Mortgage Corp., a now-defunct Alpharetta, Georgia-based mortgage wholesaler, bought the loan from Gibbs\u2019 company, according to BayRock\u2019s founder and CEO, William M. Medley Jr. In turn, Bayrock sold it to a Bear Stearns subsidiary, EMC Mortgage Corp., Medley said.  \u2018Stratospheric Compensation\u2019  Marano\u2019s team at Bear Stearns put Black\u2019s mortgage into a security called BSABS 2005-HE8, according to a person with direct knowledge of the transaction who asked not to be named because of pending litigation. Bear Stearns sold the security to Hamburg-based HSH Nordbank AG, according to court documents. In a legal complaint, HSH Nordbank says it lost \u201ca minimum of $42 million\u201d on that security and others from Bear Stearns.  In a separate  complaint , mortgage insurer Ambac Assurance Corp. says Bear Stearns \u201cdeliberately and secretly\u201d abandoned loan-quality standards to churn out securities it could sell to investors. The investment bank\u2019s conduct enabled Marano and his colleagues to receive \u201cstratospheric compensation,\u201d most of which was paid in cash, the complaint says. Marano, who is not a defendant in the case, declined to comment on it and other pending litigation.  By the end of 2007, Black was struggling to keep up with her bills. First she cut out trips to the movies, then the family\u2019s occasional dinners at the  China Inn  buffet. She drove without car insurance. Then one of her clients died and she was out of work. It bothered her to be unemployed, she says. She felt purposeless. She went on  food stamps  and fell behind on the mortgage. All she could afford to fix for dinner were chicken necks and beans, she says.  Demand Letters  Black found work again. EMC Mortgage, the Bear Stearns subsidiary, sent her letters demanding she catch up on her payments. As it was, she and the boys didn\u2019t have money to go anywhere, she says. It was work and school and come home. Her monthly payments rose to $650. Almost everything she earned she spent on food and the mortgage, she says.  In March 2008,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  bought Bear Stearns in a deal brokered by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York . Soon after, Marano joined ResCap. In 2009, his first full year at the helm, he was  paid  $5.6 million while ResCap lost $7.3 billion.  \u201cI was chosen to lead ResCap because of my depth of knowledge of the mortgage industry and my more than 25 years of experience in mortgage-backed securities,\u201d Marano said in an e-mail. \u201cI believe that given the challenges and complexities associated with ResCap I have had a significant positive impact on the business and obtained the best result possible for all interested parties.\u201d  Left Behind  In April 2010, Black says she got a letter from EMC, which had become part of JPMorgan Chase in the Bear Stearns deal, saying that the mortgage company was going to  foreclose .  \u201cI was scared the sheriff was going to come and put a lock on the door and put me out,\u201d she says. That was an embarrassment she couldn\u2019t bear, she says. \u201cWe got out in a hurry.\u201d  Among the possessions Black says she left behind were two items she wishes she\u2019d taken -- a lamp and a chair given to her by a late older sister who took her in after her father died when she was a teenager. She had no room for them in her new apartment and no money to rent a storage space.  Black filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Her $60,000 debt to EMC Mortgage was discharged.  Boarded-Up House  EMC never foreclosed. The house is still in Black\u2019s name. According to public records, she owes $1,529.35 in city and county taxes for 2011 and 2012 and $615.06 for city workers to board up the house and mow the grass after a neighbor complained of snakes.  New York-based JPMorgan Chase set a  record  with $5.7 billion of net income in the third quarter of 2012.  Black\u2019s possessions might still be in the boarded-up house, she says. \u201cIn what condition, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says.  The rent for Black\u2019s one-bedroom apartment is $475 a month including utilities.  \u201cFor the rest of my days I want to stay right where I am,\u201d Black says.  In February,  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , ResCap\u2019s parent company, was one of five mortgage firms in the $25 billion \u201crobo-signing\u201d settlement with the federal government and 49 states over the mishandling of thousands of foreclosures. The  complaint  said company representatives signed orders to repossess homes they didn\u2019t have a right to and foreclosed on homeowners who weren\u2019t behind on payments. Ally allowed Rescap to file for bankruptcy in May.  Modifying Loans  \u201cOur company\u2019s process for preparing foreclosure affidavits was flawed,\u201d Marano  told  a congressional committee in November 2010, a little more than a year before the settlement. \u201cThere were affidavits signed outside the immediate physical presence of a notary and without direct personal knowledge of the information in the affidavit. These flaws are entirely unacceptable to me.\u201d He vowed to correct the problems.  ResCap \u201chas been diligent in modifying loans whenever possible, having completed more than 820,000 default workouts for borrowers since 2008, which represent more than 30 percent of loans serviced during my tenure,\u201d Marano says in an e-mail.  Greatest Snow  In 2010, the year Black abandoned her dream home to the tall weeds, Oldpike Associates, the New Jersey-based company that lists Marano and his children as members, built a 6,000-square-foot, 4\u00bd-bathroom house on 10 acres in  Park City, Utah , according to public records. It sits on the top of a hill, surrounded by pine, aspen and oak, at the end of a winding driveway lined by boulders.  Park City, which advertises the \u201cgreatest snow on earth\u201d and hosted events of the 2002 Winter Olympics, is perhaps best known to non-skiers as the site of the Sundance Film Festival.  The Summit County tax assessor values the home at $1.69 million.  On Hazelwood Road, the house two doors down from Rebecca Black\u2019s old place sold for $3,000 in February 2011, public records show -- a 95 percent reduction from what Black paid for hers in 2005.  That was before the bloodshed.  On the night of March 30, police say Calvin DeWayne Jefferson, commonly known as Mack Kane, was behind the wheel of a white pickup truck when two men approached him on Hazelwood Road. One or both of them shot Jefferson,  police say . As he died, the truck kept rolling, according to a resident, Katie Greer. It flattened a section of chain-link fence across the street from Black\u2019s old house.  Angel\u2019s Trumpets  It\u2019s impossible to draw a straight line from the community\u2019s decline to Jefferson\u2019s death, says Kioni Logan, who grew up in the neighborhood and says she knew Cal, as she calls him, for more than a decade. It would be equally wrong to conclude there\u2019s no connection at all, she says.  Police haven\u2019t announced any suspects and haven\u2019t called the killing gang-related. Still, Logan says she believes gangsters played a role.  \u201cGangs take over empty houses,\u201d she says. \u201cThey do whatever they want.\u201d  Greer says Jefferson\u2019s killers fled into the woods along a path in the grass between the house with gang graffiti and the house where she\u2019s lived for 13 years.  \u201cIt\u2019s really depressing,\u201d Greer says, looking out her storm door, hands folded at her chin. \u201cI try to stay prayed-up and sometimes that doesn\u2019t even work.\u201d  In the front yard of her old house, Rebecca Black searches for her favorites, the droopy yellow flowers called  Angel\u2019s trumpets . She has to high-step through overgrown grass, and when she finds them there are no blossoms, just green stalks choked by weeds.
