 "context": "The following article called 'MTN\u2019s Nhleko Becomes Chairman Amid Revived India M&A Plans' was published on 2013-05-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPhuthuma Nhleko increased  MTN Group\nLtd. (MTN) \u2019s subscribers almost 30-fold during his near-nine year\ntenure as chief executive officer and pushed the African\nwireless carrier into countries such as Iran and  Syria . As he\nbecomes chairman today, one nation lingers in his mind: India.  Five years after first trying to strike a deal with a phone\ncompany in India, Johannesburg-based MTN is evaluating assets in\nthe country, said four people familiar with the matter, asking\nnot to be identified because the deliberations are private. The\ndiscussions could lead to a revival of an attempt to link up\nwith  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) , the carrier of billionaire\nAnil Ambani that tried unsuccessfully to merge with MTN in 2008,\nthree of the people said.  MTN was twice in talks to be bought by another Indian\noperator, New Delhi-based  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , until negotiations\nbroke down in 2009 amid political opposition in South  Africa . A\nsuccessful deal this time would give MTN its first major\nfoothold in  Asia , bringing it closer to matching the\ninternational reach of  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   \u201cIt would make sense, to the extent that such an\nopportunity presented itself, to look eastwards,\u201d Nhleko said\nin a late 2009 interview, after MTN ended merger talks with\nBharti. \u201cOur natural bent and inclination would always be\nAfrica, the  Middle East , and, most probably, opportunities\nfurther eastwards.\u201d  Market Value  This time, MTN may have greater bargaining power. Reliance\nCommunications shares have fallen 74 percent and Bharti is down\n28 percent since those botched deals through yesterday, while\nMTN has jumped two-thirds since 2009 to give it a market value\nof $35 billion, more than the two Indian companies combined.  Reliance Communications dropped 2 percent to 110.4 rupees\nat the close of trading in  Mumbai , valuing the company at about\n$4 billion. MTN declined 3.2 percent to 176 rand in\nJohannesburg. The stock slid as much as 1.9 percent yesterday\nafter  Bloomberg News  reported the Indian plans.  \u201cBuying Reliance won\u2019t be cheap and it would be a really\ndifficult operation,\u201d Khulekani Dlamini, head of research at\nAfena Capital, said in the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s an adverse\nenvironment all around, the shareholders are not particularly\neasy to do deal with. Its highly competitive, very fragmented,\nregulatory concepts are very fluid in India which makes managing\nthe company very difficult.\u201d  Funding Room  Ambani is unlikely to exit Reliance Communications, India\u2019s\nthird-largest wireless operator by customers, making an outright\ntakeover less probable, said one of the people.  Representatives at Reliance Communications and Ambani\u2019s\noffice didn\u2019t have a comment. In an e-mailed statement, MTN said\nit doesn\u2019t comment on \u201cmarket speculation.\u201d  Bruce Main, a  fund manager  at Ivy Asset Management Ltd.,\nsaid MTN could \u201cquite comfortably\u201d fund an acquisition with\ndebt and its own cash. An obstacle would be \u201cthe competitive\nenvironment in India, which is so aggressive that the main\nmobile operators started slashing margins substantially,\u201d he\nsaid.  MTN, led by CEO Sifiso Dabengwa, is seeking to expand\nbeyond Africa and the Middle East amid increased competition and\nslowing growth in the region\u2019s phone market. Last quarter, MTN\u2019s\nmonthly revenue per user in  South Africa  dropped 10 percent to\n110.62 rand ($11.30) from a year earlier.  Orascom Telecom  Nhleko, who replaces  Cyril Ramaphosa , took over at MTN in\n2002 when the company had just over 5 million mobile subscribers\nand operations in six countries including South Africa and\nCameroon. By the time he left, the customer count reached 147\nmillion, tapping into countries including Syria, Iran and\n Afghanistan . In all, MTN has operations in 21 countries when\nNhleko stepped down in March 2011.  MTN expansion would have been faster if it wasn\u2019t for\nNhleko\u2019s failure to close four deals, including as much as $10\nbillion in assets of Orascom Telecom Holding SAE, over a two-year period.  Yesterday, MTN said its subscribers exceeded 197 million at\nthe end of April. MTN is the biggest carrier in  Nigeria ,\nalthough at home in South Africa, its market share trails that\nof  Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , a Vodafone unit.  MTN is one of 12 operators shortlisted for the sale of two\ntelecommunications licenses in Myanmar and is looking for other\ntargets in southeast Asia.  Vodafone Taxes  In 2008, talks to combine MTN with Mumbai-based Reliance\nbroke down amid disagreements between Anil Ambani and his\nbrother, Mukesh, who had split the Reliance business empire\nafter a public feud. Last month, the Ambani brothers signed a 12\nbillion rupee ($215 million) pact to share a fiber-optic\nnetwork, their first deal since breaking up Reliance.  Bharti Airtel is the largest mobile-phone company in India,\nfollowed by Vodafone and Reliance Communications, according to\nFebruary data from the country\u2019s phone regulator. In 2010,\nBharti Airtel expanded to Africa by buying Kuwaiti carrier\nZain\u2019s African assets for $9 billion.  India \u2019s telecommunications market has proven challenging\nfor foreign companies looking to tap its growing middle class.\nVodafone has been embroiled in a long-running dispute over tax\npayments with Indian regulators, and has said it isn\u2019t planning\non investing in high-speed fourth-generation mobile services in\nthe country amid confusion over the future of its license there.
