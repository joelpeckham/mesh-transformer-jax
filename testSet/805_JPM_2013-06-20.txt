The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe futures industry lobbying\norganizations based in the U.S. and  Europe  are combining to\naddress financial regulation on a global scale, the groups said\nin a statement.  The Futures Industry Association, based in  Washington , will\nmerge with the London-based Futures & Options Association to\ncreate FIA Global, they said in a joint statement today. The\ngroups\u2019 members include the world\u2019s largest banks such as\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG\nand Barclays Plc.  The majority of commissioners at the Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission have signaled they want to delay final action\non how new derivatives rules created by the Dodd-Frank Act of\n2010 apply to foreign banks and the overseas affiliates of U.S.\nbanks and hedge funds. CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  has insisted\nthe agency should take its final vote on the guidance by July\n12, when the current deadline expires.  Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives last week\npassed legislation that would curb the CTFC\u2019s authority to\noversee the $633 trillion global swaps market. While the bill is\nnot expected to be introduced in the Senate, the House vote\ncould increase pressure on Gensler to agree to a delay.  Market \u2018Fragmentation\u2019  \u201cThis new affiliation will address a major industry\nconcern -- the fragmentation of derivatives markets along\njurisdictional lines,\u201d Walt Lukken, chief executive officer of\nthe FIA, said in the statement.  The international reach of CFTC swap-trading requirements\nhas been one of the most controversial elements of Dodd-Frank.\nThe CFTC became the predominant U.S. regulator of swaps under\nthe law, while the Securities and Exchange Commission was\nassigned to write rules for equity and some credit-default\nswaps.  The European Union is seeking an agreement with the U.S.\nthat its banks can be exempted from the CFTC\u2019s rules because it\nsays EU standards are equally rigorous. Overseas regulators have\ncalled for the CFTC to broaden its use of such \u201csubstituted\ncompliance,\u201d which was also incorporated into the SEC\u2019s\nproposed rule.
