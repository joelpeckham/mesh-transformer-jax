The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service\nwill prevent companies from entering into transactions that\nallow them to tap their offshore cash stockpiles without paying\ntaxes, the government said.  \u201cThe IRS and the Treasury Department believe that these\ntransactions raise significant policy concerns,\u201d the agencies\nsaid in a notice today.  The government plans to write regulations to enforce the\nchange, and those rules will take effect today.  \u201cThis is what they do when they want to close down a\ntransaction they find objectionable and they don\u2019t know exactly\nhow they want to do it,\u201d said  Robert Willens , a corporate tax\nconsultant in New York.  Companies owe U.S. taxes on income they earn around the\nworld after receiving credits for foreign taxes paid. Under U.S.\ntax law, they must pay those taxes only when they repatriate the\nincome.  That system has led companies including  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,\n Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  to keep foreign profits outside\nthe U.S. Data compiled by Bloomberg in March showed that 70\ncompanies have $1.2 trillion in untaxed profits around the\nworld, up 18.4 percent from a year earlier.  Those companies and others lobbied Congress unsuccessfully\nin 2011 for a temporary tax holiday on repatriated profits.\nRepublicans including presidential candidate  Mitt Romney  favor\nchanging the tax system permanently to allow companies to bring\nmost overseas profits into this country without facing the\nresidual U.S. tax.  Two Transactions  The IRS notice describes two types of transactions it is\ntrying to prevent and says the agency is \u201caware\u201d that\ntaxpayers are engaging in them. One involves selling a patent\nfrom a U.S. company to a foreign subsidiary without triggering\nan immediate U.S. tax.  In the other type of transaction, a company uses its\noffshore money to purchase a U.S. company and quickly\nreorganizes to move the purchased company outside the U.S.  Willens said the second transaction is likely the way that\n New Brunswick , New Jersey-based  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  used one of\nits foreign subsidiaries to purchase Synthes Inc., based in  West\nChester , Pennsylvania.  In a June 12 filing with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission, Johnson & Johnson said it believed the Synthes\ntransactions would be tax-efficient.  \u2018Contrary Positions\u2019  \u201cIt is possible that the  Internal Revenue Service  could\nassert one or more contrary positions to challenge the\ntransactions from a tax perspective,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cIf\nchallenged, an amount up to the total purchase price for the\nSynthes shares could be treated as subject to applicable U.S.\ntax at approximately the statutory rate to Johnson & Johnson,\nplus interest.\u201d  The IRS announcement, Willens said, makes it impossible for\nother companies to follow.  \u201cThe hope was that this would be a viable strategy for a\nyear or two,\u201d he said.
