 "context": "The following article called 'Central Banks\u2019 Unorthodox Actions Are Cutting Lending' was published on 2012-07-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe unintended consequences of\nfinancial policy intervention are providing fresh evidence for\nchaos theory\u2019s idea that the flap of a butterfly\u2019s wings can\nspark a tornado on the other side of the world.  Five years into the age of deleveraging, financial markets\nhave become addicted to central bank intervention, from the U.S.\nFederal Reserve to the  European Central Bank  and beyond, aimed\nat stimulating growth. Markets  anticipate  further action, with\nthe Fed, ECB and Bank of  England  committees meeting on monetary\npolicy this week.  But no flap of a central banker\u2019s wings goes quite as\nexpected.  Take  China \u2019s heroic 2008-2009 stimulus program, which\nhelped fight back a global recession. It also led to huge\noverinvestment and bad debt, and the policy is now viewed by\nmany economists as an error.  Similarly, the ECB\u2019s long-term multibillion-euro\nrefinancing operation, announced in December 2011, saved\n Europe \u2019s banking system from a funding crisis. But it created a\ndangerous web of links between an overleveraged banking sector\nand already indebted sovereigns.  Official lending rates are close to zero, and their\nmanipulation, the traditional mainstay of monetary policy, is\neffectively impotent. The new go-to tool for central bankers,\nquantitative easing, is suffering from declining marginal\nreturns.  Unorthodox Action  As the International Monetary Fund economist  Manmohan Singh \nnotes in a  working paper  published this month, the Fed\u2019s\nquantitative easing policy replaced long-term Treasuries with\nshort-term bills or cash, which circulate less quickly through\nthe system as collateral for bank funding.  The bottom line is that the very actions central banks and\nregulators have been taking to increase confidence in the\nbanking sector might be undermining banks\u2019 ability to lend.\nAlthough central bank actions have lowered longer term borrowing\ncosts, this has not spurred credit demand. Businesses and\nhouseholds are either so frightened or so overleveraged that\nthey\u2019re saving and cutting debt, no matter how cheap it is to\nborrow.  In part because lending remains weak, and in part because\nsome of their own efforts are starting to work against them,\ncentral banks are forced to become increasingly unorthodox in\ntheir efforts to stimulate growth. In one measure announced last\nweek, the  Bank of England , together with the U.K. Treasury,\nstarted a \u201cfunding for lending\u201d initiative, in effect channeling\ncentral bank money directly to consumers and businesses -- an\nunprecedented move.  The ECB has made some of the most striking innovations, yet\nthese do not seem to be boosting bank lending either. At its\nmeeting in July, for example, the ECB cut its deposit rate to\nzero in an effort to get more than 800 billion euros ($980\nbillion) -- equivalent to 8 percent of the euro area\u2019s gross\ndomestic product -- that commercial banks had parked in the\nECB\u2019s accounts out into the wider economy.  The amount held on deposit at the ECB declined by more than\nhalf, but the money didn\u2019t flow into new lending. Instead, some\ndepositors started using the central bank\u2019s reserve facility,\nwhich also pays zero rates but offers better liquidity. Other\ninvestors drove Austrian, Dutch, Finnish and German two-year\nbond yields negative as they rushed to place their cash. They\nalso took on more risk, either by buying longer-term paper\n(five-year German bund yields fell by 0.12 percentage points in\nthe two weeks after the cut) or by investing in riskier short-\nterm paper (AA-rated French two-year bond yields fell by 0.28\npercentage points). Even yields on Bulgarian six-month euro-\ndenominated bonds halved in the two weeks after the ECB action.  Lower Yields  These ripples in the market have reduced yields available\non the high-quality bonds that banks are required to hold, and\ncut the spread between short- and long-term  interest rates  to a\nthree-year low. Both outcomes make it less profitable for banks\nto lend.  Of course, the fall in profits from bank lending is not the\nsole fault of the ECB. New regulatory capital requirements,\ndesigned to make banks safer and boost confidence in the system,\nrequire banks to deleverage and cut lending.  McKinsey & Co.\nestimates  that the return on equity for retail banks has dropped\nto 6 percent (from 10 percent) as a result of new regulatory\nrequirements.  The question today is not whether the ECB\u2019s latest action\nin cutting deposit rates will boost lending, but whether it will\nunintentionally crimp lending further. A number of euro-\ndenominated money-market funds were forced to close to new\nentrants after the ECB\u2019s deposit rate cut, because returns after\nfees became negative. Further closings could cut off an\nimportant source of funding for the banking sector.  Now some ECB members are discussing the possibility of\nintroducing negative deposit rates. This would send investors on\na renewed hunt for yield, and leave banks with the options of\nlending, hoarding physical cash in vaults or paying for the\nprivilege of holding cash at the ECB. That\u2019s a stark choice, but\nit still might not boost loan growth. A survey of the ECB\u2019s\nmoney-market experts suggested that 75 percent of banks would\nnot change their behavior, even with a negative rate. If this\nproves to be the case, central banks may need to get more daring\nstill. And each new action will risk new unintended\nconsequences.  Central bankers have taken bold actions in recent years to\nstave off systemic collapse and to try to fight slow growth. But\nchaos theory teaches us that dynamic systems are sensitive and\nunpredictable. From now on, central bankers need to pay more\nheed to what the real impact of their policy measures will be.  Improving Confidence  There are ways of boosting growth and lending without\nhaving to experiment with untested policies. Investors\u2019 aversion\nto risk, banks\u2019 aversion to lending and business\u2019 aversion to\nborrowing are as much about a lack of confidence in the future\nas anything else. Firmer statements of support from central\nbankers, politicians and regulators could go a long way toward\nsolving this crisis of confidence.  ECB President  Mario Draghi \u2019s promise last week to do\n\u201c whatever it takes \u201d to preserve the euro was a case in point,\nand led to a sharp rally in risk assets. Similar pledges to act\nas the euro area\u2019s lender of the last resort and tolerate higher\ninflation would be just as beneficial -- and without having to\nleap further into the unknown.
