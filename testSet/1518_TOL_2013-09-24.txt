 "context": "The following article called 'Toll CEO Says Contracts Flat as Buyers Digest Rate Rise' was published on 2013-09-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nToll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  Chief Executive\nOfficer Douglas Yearley said business is flat seven weeks into\nthe homebuilder\u2019s fourth quarter as buyers are temporarily\nholding back after an abrupt rise in mortgage rates.  \u201cThe move from 3.5 percent to 4.75 percent happened so\nquickly,\u201d Yearley said in a panel discussion at the Bloomberg\nMarkets 50 Summit in New York today. \u201cThere were some buyers\nthat had to digest it.\u201d  Orders slowed in the fiscal third quarter for  Lennar Corp. (LEN) \nand  KB Home (KBH) , the homebuilders reported today, in a sign that\nrising mortgage rates are cooling demand. For Horsham,\nPennsylvania-based Toll, the largest U.S. luxury-home builder,\nthe flat  sales (NHSLTOT)  in recent weeks follow a strong comparison to a\nyear ago, Yearley said.  The number of contracts signed to sell  new homes  dropped 13\npercent in the U.S. in July from June, according to the Commerce\nDepartment. The  median price  gained at an 8.3 percent pace from\na year earlier, slower than the prior month\u2019s 11 percent\nincrease and less than half of April\u2019s 18 percent jump.  Sales probably increased 6.6 percent in August, according\nto the median estimate of 77 economists. The Commerce Department\nis due to report the figures tomorrow.  Homebuilders had been some of the biggest winners from the\n Federal Reserve \u2019s efforts to push down borrowing costs to record\nlows, with a Bloomberg stock  index  of 14 companies more than\ndoubling in 2012. The gauge was little changed in the three\nmonths through today as 30-year  mortgage rates  jumped from a\nnear-record low of 3.35 percent in May to 4.57 percent at the\nbeginning of September, according to  Freddie Mac .  Rate \u2018Pause\u2019  Rates dropped to 4.5 percent in the week ended Sept. 19,\nand may fall further after the Fed\u2019s decision not to curb its\npurchases of bonds.  \u201cThe market is digesting and accepting that and\nunderstanding that it\u2019s still a great rate,\u201d Yearley said. \u201cWe\nare going through a little bit of a pause here where the builder\nnumbers are a little bit flat, but we still feel that it will be\njust fine.\u201d  Strict mortgage-lending standards and a scarcity of\navailable land means the U.S. will see fewer homes  constructed \nthan the 1.5 million built annually before the housing crash,\nYearley said. Toll Brothers and other publicly traded builders\nhave been able to increase their earnings amid tight supplies of\nexisting homes on the market and rising demand from buyers.  \u201cSo many people want to either own their first home or\nmove up,\u201d Yearley said.  Commercial Deals  Among commercial properties, a rise in  interest rates \nhasn\u2019t been \u201cabrupt\u201d enough to undermine the high prices paid\nfor recent deals, said Richard Lefrak, chairman of property firm\nLefrak Organization, which owns more than 400 buildings.  \u201cIf we saw rates normalize and long term rates will jump\nto 6, 7, 8 percent, a lot of the transactions that happened in\nthe last 24 months will be trashed,\u201d he said at the conference.  Owners who paid high prices after borrowing at low rates\nmust be \u201cwell capitalized\u201d to weather an inevitable rise in\ninterest rates, said Steven Witkoff, chief executive officer of\nNew York-based developer Witkoff Group LLC, which is building\nseveral ultra-luxury condominium projects in Manhattan  \u201cAll that cheap money is causing a real escalation in\ncosts,\u201d he said.
