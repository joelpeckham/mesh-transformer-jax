The net loss expanded to $217.2 million, or 44 cents a\nshare, Las Vegas-based MGM Resorts said today in a  statement .\nExcluding an MGM China dividend tax and other items, the per-\nshare loss was 9 cents. Analysts projected a loss of 16 cents,\nthe average of 22 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  MGM customers won more money than anticipated in March,\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer James Murren said in a\ntelephone interview.  \u201cWe expect to be a growing company for the rest of the\nyear,\u201d Murren said, citing improving casino and\nhotel revenues. First-quarter sales rose, benefiting from growth\nin  China  and improving Nevada tourism.  Gambling revenue on the Las Vegas Strip rose 5.4 percent\nindustrywide through eight months of the fiscal year that began\nJuly 1, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board.  MGM Resorts holds 51 percent of MGM China Holdings Ltd.,\nwhich owns a casino in Macau, the only part of China where\ngambling is legal. April casino revenue in Macau rose 22 percent\nto 25 billion patacas ($3.13 billion), the Gaming Inspection and\nCoordination Bureau said yesterday.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization were $430 million in the quarter, $44 million below\nestimate, according to Joseph Greff, casino analyst at JPMorgan\nChase & Co.
