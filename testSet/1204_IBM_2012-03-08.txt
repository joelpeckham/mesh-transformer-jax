 "context": "The following article called 'Jobless Claims in U.S. Rose 8,000 Last Week' was published on 2012-03-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe number of Americans filing\nclaims for  jobless benefits  rose to 362,000 last week, a level\nconsistent with an improving labor market.  Applications for unemployment insurance payments increased\nby 8,000 in the week ended March 3, Labor Department figures\nshowed today. Economists forecast 352,000 claims, according to\nthe  median estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey. The average over\nthe past four weeks held close to a four-year low.  The rate of firings indicates companies have grown more\ncomfortable with headcounts and could take on additional\nemployees when demand picks up. Economists forecast a Labor\nDepartment report tomorrow will show that employers boosted\npayrolls in February and the  jobless rate  held at an almost\nthree-year low.  \u201cThe level of claims is still quite low,\u201d said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. \u201cI\u2019m\nstill encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen in the labor market in\nrecent months.\u201d  Stocks rose as more investors indicated they will\nparticipate in  Greece \u2019s debt swap. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\nIndex climbed 0.6 percent to 1,361.22 at 10:58 a.m. in  New York .  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 345,000 to\n370,000 in the Bloomberg News survey of 52 economists. The Labor\nDepartment revised the prior week\u2019s applications to 354,000 from\nthe initially reported 351,000.  Nothing Unusual  A Labor Department official today said there were no\nunusual circumstances affecting today\u2019s figures.  The four-week  moving average , a less-volatile measure, was\nlittle changed at 355,000 from 354,750, which were the fewest\nsince March 2008.  The number of people  continuing  to collect jobless benefits\nrose by 10,000 in the week ended Feb. 25 to 3.42 million. The\ncontinuing claims figure does not include the number of workers\nreceiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who\u2019ve used up their traditional benefits and are now\ncollecting emergency and extended payments increased by about\n26,800 to 3.4 million in the week ended Feb. 18.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits\nheld at 2.7 percent in the week ended Feb. 25, today\u2019s report\nshowed. Twelve states and territories reported an increase in\nclaims, while 41 had a decrease.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to\nfall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls\nreport -- accelerates.  More Employment  Job creation  has strengthened in recent months. The\nprojected 210,000 increase in February payrolls would cap the\nbest six-month stretch of job growth since the period ended June\n2006, more than a year before the recession began. Employers\ntook on an estimated 1.13 million workers from September through\nFebruary.  Data from a private report based on payrolls showed\ncompanies added more workers in February than a month earlier.\nEmployment increased by 216,000 last month after a 173,000 gain\nin January, according to figures from ADP Employer Services\nreleased yesterday.  Improving job prospects will help absorb those who are\nstill losing jobs.  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) , the\nworld\u2019s largest computer-services provider, fired more than\n1,000 workers in  North America  last week, according to employee\nadvocacy group Alliance@IBM.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said \u201cthe job\nmarket remains far from normal\u201d when he spoke at a U.S. House\nhearing in  Washington  last week. The 8.3 percent unemployment\nrate and a subdued inflation outlook warrant a highly\naccommodative stance for monetary policy, he said.
