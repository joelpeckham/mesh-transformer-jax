(VLO) , the world\u2019s\nlargest independent refiner by processing capacity, rose to the\nhighest level since June 2008 after reporting a 20-fold increase\nin fourth-quarter profit driven by cheap U.S. crude.  Valero climbed 13 percent to $43.77 at the close in  New\nYork , the biggest gain on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, after\nthe San Antonio-based company said net income rose to $1.01\nbillion, or $1.82 a share, from $45 million a year ago.  Per-share profit excluding a loss stemming from the\nshutdown of its Aruba refinery was 68 cents more than the $1.20\naverage of 18  analysts\u2019 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales\nrose less than 1 percent to $34.7 billion.  Valero ceased all imports of light oil at its refineries in\n Memphis  and the U.S. Gulf Coast in the fourth quarter, relying\ninstead on cheaper crude produced in new U.S. fields, Valero\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer  Bill Klesse  said in the\nstatement. The company is looking for ways to process more North\nAmerican crude, which it expects \u201cto become increasingly more\navailable.\u201d  \u201cThis was a blowout, the best quarter for the company in\nyears,\u201d  Fadel Gheit , a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer &\nCo., said in a telephone interview today. \u201cThe question they\nneed to answer now is how they are going to boost the stock\nprice, which is undervalued. What are they going to do for the\nshareholder?\u201d  Refining Sector  Valero\u2019s refining gross margin was 20 percent higher than\nexpected,  Paul Sankey , a New York-based analyst with Deutsche\nbank, said in a note to clients. The company benefited\nparticularly from a high profit margin at its refineries on the\nU.S. Gulf Coast and in the midwest, Sankey said.  Refiners rose more than any other energy sector in 2012 as\nU.S. crude production rose to the highest level since 1993,\nexceeding demand and keeping U.S. prices an average $21.85 a\nbarrel  lower  than the global benchmark. Buying oil for less and\nselling fuel at a price linked to more expensive crude fueled\nthe highest fourth-quarter per share profit Valero has seen\nsince 2005, according to the statement.  Valero, which has 13 buy ratings, nine holds and two sells\nfrom analysts, has  gained  27 percent this year.
