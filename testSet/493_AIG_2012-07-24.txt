The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWalnut Place, which was challenging\n Bank of America Corp. \u2019s proposed $8.5 billion mortgage-bond\nsettlement with investors, withdrew from litigation over the\ndeal.  Walnut Place entities that intervened in the case sought\ncourt permission to withdraw today without giving a reason, in\npapers filed in New York State Supreme Court. Justice Barbara Kapnick approved an order permitting the withdrawal.  The move is a boost for  Charlotte , North Carolina-based\nBank of America, which reached the settlement last year to\nresolve claims over Countrywide Financial mortgage bonds. The\naccord is before Kapnick for approval.  Walnut Place is among investors including  American\nInternational Group Inc. (AIG)  that intervened seeking more\ninformation about the agreement. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Delaware Attorney Beau Biden are also\nparticipating in the case, with Schneiderman\u2019s office calling\nthe settlement \u201cunfair\u201d to investors.  Walnut Place said in court papers that it had \u201cserious\nconcerns\u201d about the adequacy of the settlement and that Bank of\nAmerica was paying $8.5 billion to resolve claims \u201cworth many\ntimes that amount.\u201d  Walnut Place is a pseudonym used by hedge fund Baupost\nGroup LLC, Theodore Mirvis, a Bank of America attorney, said at\na hearing in  New York  Supreme Court, according to a transcript.  Earlier Suit  Walnut Place sued Bank of America in a separate case,\nseeking to force the lender to repurchase loans backing more\nthan $1 billion in mortgage bonds. Kapnick dismissed the\ncomplaint in March and an appeals court upheld the dismissal\nlast month.  James Ankner, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, said the\ninvestors that reached the proposed settlement with Bank of\nAmerica represent \u201conly a small minority\u201d of investors\naffected by the agreement.  AIG and others that have entered the case \u201crepresent a\nbroad spectrum of investors who are continuing to press for\ninformation in order to evaluate the fairness of the proposal\nand the process used to reach it,\u201d Ankner said in an e-mailed\nstatement.  Elaine Mann, a spokeswoman for Boston-based Baupost, and\nOwen Cyrulnik, an attorney for Walnut Place, declined to comment\non the withdrawal. Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America\nspokesman, also declined to comment on it.
