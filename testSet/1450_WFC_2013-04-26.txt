 "context": "The following article called 'Stripping Dimon of Chairman Title Is \u2018Nuts,\u2019 Langone Says' was published on 2013-04-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nKenneth Langone, the billionaire\nco-founder of  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , said  Jamie Dimon  is one of the\nbest U.S. business leaders and should keep his dual role as\n JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \u2019s chairman and chief executive officer.  \u201cHe should be both,\u201d Langone, 77, said in an interview on\nBloomberg Television, calling it \u201cnuts\u201d to consider splitting\nDimon\u2019s  titles . \u201cHe\u2019s probably the finest CEO across any\nbusiness in America.\u201d  Dimon, 57, has come under increasing pressure to give up\nthe chairman\u2019s job since New York-based JPMorgan lost more than\n$6.2 billion on a derivatives bet last year. The board of\ndirectors has stood by him, urging  investors  to vote against a\nshareholder proposal to name a separate chairman at next month\u2019s\nannual meeting.  \u201cI love Jamie, I know him well personally, I love him,\u201d\nsaid Langone. The so-called London Whale episode and the bank\u2019s\nsubsequent  record annual profit  proved that JPMorgan was a great\nbank, he said. \u201cGo to  Europe  where they split them up. Where\nare the results? Where are the economic results?\u201d  Directors of JPMorgan have said that Dimon\u2019s dual role\nremains the \u201cmost effective leadership model\u201d for the company.\nA similar proposal last year failed with 40 percent of the vote.  Best Management  \u201cWho\u2019s the best-run bank in America today?\u201d Langone said.\n\u201cCertainly you\u2019d have to say JPMorgan and  Wells Fargo. (WFC) \u201d  JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets, and San\nFrancisco-based Wells Fargo & Co. is the nation\u2019s largest home\nlender. Langone said he owns JPMorgan warrants.  The bank\u2019s trading loss was tied to  credit derivatives \namassed by Bruno Iksil, a U.K. trader in the chief investment\noffice who was dubbed the London Whale because his positions\nwere so big.  A CEO who doubles as chairman doesn\u2019t need to hold himself\naccountable because the rest of the board\u2019s directors will do\nthat, Langone said.  \u201cI\u2019ve got nine people in a room or seven or five or\nwhatever the number is,\u201d Langone said. \u201cThey\u2019ll fire me if I\ndo the wrong thing.\u201d Directors who don\u2019t have the courage to do\nthat shouldn\u2019t be on the board, he said.
