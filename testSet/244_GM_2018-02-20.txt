The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors ( GM.N ) has offered to convert debt of around $2.2 billion owed by its ailing South Korean operation into equity in exchange for financial support and tax benefits from Seoul, four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nThe restructuring proposal comes after the Detroit automaker announced last week that it would shut its plant in the city of Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, by May and decide the future of the remaining three plants in the country within weeks.\nThe debt for equity swap would allow GM\u2019s business in South Korea to continue operating. It was not immediately clear how the deal would affect the interest of the state-run Korea Development Bank, which owns 17 percent of GM Korea.\nGM\u2019s decision was the latest in a series of steps it has made to put profitability and innovation ahead of sales and volume. Since 2015, GM has exited unprofitable markets including Europe, Australia, South Africa and Russia.\nIt was not immediately clear how much fresh capital GM has demanded from the South Korean government to keep operating its Korean business, which employs nearly 16,000 people.\nBut one of the sources said GM had asked Seoul to provide financial support worth over $1 billion, while several sources said GM wanted its South Korea factory sites designated as special foreign investment zones that would make the company eligible for tax breaks for seven years.\n\u201cGM says it will recapitalize its Korean unit, and in return it\u2019s asking South Korea to accept its packaged proposal that includes government support worth over $1 billion,\u201d the person said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.\nA GM Korea spokesman said the company would continue to work with the government and labor union to secure support for its viability plan.\nOn Tuesday, Barry Engle, head of GM\u2019s international operations, met with a task force headed by a ruling party lawmaker from Bupyeong, where GM Korea has its biggest manufacturing plant, to discuss its restructuring plan.\nAfter the meeting, Engle told reporters the company wanted to stay in South Korea.\n\u201cIt is certainly our preference to stay and to fix the business and continue to be an important part of the Korea economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2018m encouraged by the discussions and I am optimistic that that is an outcome that together we can achieve.\u201d He declined to comment further on the discussions between GM and the South Korean government.\nA South Korean lawmaker, Kim Sung-tae, said Engle told the lawmakers that the company planned to produce two new models in South Korea.\nEngle did not elaborate on whether GM\u2019s plan for the two new car models were dependent on government support for the automaker, said Kim, who attended the meeting.\nEngle told lawmakers that GM Korea would try to maintain output at the current level of around 500,000 vehicles a year, according to Kang Hoon-sik, a spokesperson for the ruling party. GM\u2019s South Korean unit produced 519,385 vehicles last year, compared with 942,805 a decade ago.\nFinance Minister Kim Dong-yeon told reporters on Tuesday that the government would \u201cclosely consult with GM to normalize its management,\u201d adding that a due diligence on the company should come first.\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential office also said Tuesday that it would designate Gunsan an employment \u201ccrisis zone\u201d, opening the way for government subsidies like cheap loans and and other financial support for those laid off.\nNO DECISION YET South Korean government officials said it was too early to decide on any financial backing, as it wanted to conduct due diligence before committing fresh investment in GM Korea.\nThe tensions also come at a difficult time for U.S.-South Korean relations given U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s determination to renegotiate the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement.\nKorea Development Bank believes the auto maker has not shared sufficient information about its finances or the cause of its mounting losses, according to officials from the bank and government officials.\n\u201cThey have requested for help and a thorough audit of the situation is among many preconditions before any public funds can be set aside,\u201d a government official told Reuters, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, referring to GM.\nAnother government official said GM had not filed an official application to get its South Korea factory sites designated as foreign investment zones, but it was \u201ctesting waters\u201d to check the possibility.\nSouth Korea was for years a low-cost export hub for GM, producing close to a fifth of its global output at its peak.\nBut the automaker\u2019s decision to exit other unprofitable markets have exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which used to build many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe.\nGM Korea posted a total of 1.9 trillion won ($1.8 billion) in net losses between 2014 and 2016.\nAdditional reporting by Cynthia Kim; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Philip McClellan\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of General Motors Company was 37.4255256652832 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of General Motors Company was ",
