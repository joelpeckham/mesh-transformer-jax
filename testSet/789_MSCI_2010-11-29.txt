 "context": "The following article called 'Hungary Stocks Enter Bear Market, Bonds Sink on Concern Crisis Will Expand' was published on 2010-11-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHungary\u2019s  benchmark  equity index\ndropped more than 20 percent from its 2010 peak and government\nbonds sank as a surprise interest-rate increase compounded\nconcern that Europe\u2019s debt crisis is spreading east.  The  BUX  Index gauge fell 2.6 percent to 20,221.37 today,\nthe world\u2019s second-worst performer after Turkey\u2019s  ISE National\n100 Index . Local-currency notes due February 2015 tumbled for a\nsixth day, lifting yields by 25 basis points to a 14-month high\nof 8.192 percent at 5:25 p.m. in Budapest. The forint, Poland\u2019s\nzloty and the Czech koruna led emerging-market currencies lower.  Hungary\u2019s central bank unexpectedly raised its benchmark\ninterest rate today to combat the fastest inflation since June\nand support the forint after the currency sank to its weakest\nlevel in two months against the euro. Prime Minister  Viktor Orban \u2019s administration is levying special taxes and\nfunneling assets from private pensions to plug the government\u2019s\nbudget gap while funding crises in Greece and Ireland push up\nborrowing costs for Europe\u2019s most-indebted nations.  \u201cWith global markets under some pressure at the moment,\ninvestors don\u2019t need to find an excuse to sell risky assets, and\nthe news flow out of Hungary at present just continues to be\ndownbeat,\u201d  Timothy Ash , London-based head of emerging-market\nresearch at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in a report\ntoday. \u201cWe would continue to recommend reducing exposure.\u201d  Hungary was the first European Union nation to receive an\nInternational Monetary Fund bailout during the global credit\ncrisis two years ago after its widening budget deficit and\nconsumers\u2019 spiraling foreign-currency debt spurred investors to\ndump Hungarian assets.  \u2018Slow Death\u2019  The government told Hungarians on Nov. 24 to move some of\ntheir private-retirement fund assets to government control or\nlose their state pension, an ultimatum designed to shift 3\ntrillion forint ($14.1 billion) to close the  budget  gaps.  The pension policies \u201ccondemn the local equity market to a\nslow death,\u201d Matthias Siller, who helps manage $4 billion in\nEurope, Middle East and Africa stocks at Baring Investment\nServices in London, said in a phone interview today. \u201cIt means\nthat equities will list at big, big discounts to other places.\u201d  Fitch Ratings said last week it may cut the country rating\nfrom BBB, the second-lowest investment grade, because the\npension changes are \u201cnegative\u201d for the public finances. Credit\nAgricole Cheuvreux SA said last week investors should reduce\nholdings of Hungarian equities, citing the \u201ccomplete\nunpredictability\u201d of the government\u2019s decisions and a risk of\nrating downgrades.  \u2018Very Troubled\u2019  European stocks fell today, extending a three-week decline,\nthe euro weakened to a two-month low versus the dollar, and the\ncost of insuring against default on Portuguese and Spanish debt\nsoared to record-high levels as an 85 billion-euro ($113\nbillion) package of emergency loans for Ireland failed to\nreassure investors the region\u2019s debt crisis will be contained.  Hungary\u2019s government bonds extended their biggest monthly\nselloff since February 2009. The 2015 bond now yields 1.48\npercentage points more than at the end of October. The forint\nplunged 1.2 percent to 283.51 per euro, making it the world\u2019s\nworst-performing currency in November with a 4.3 percent\ndepreciation.  \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the euro zone is making eastern\nEurope very troubled,\u201d said Koon Chow, emerging-markets\nstrategist at Barclays Capital, in a phone interview from\nLondon. In Hungary, \u201cthe central bank is worried about the\nimpact the weakening of the exchange rate may have on economic\nimbalances.\u201d  The cost of protecting Hungary\u2019s debt against non-payment\nwith credit default swaps rose to 365 basis points today, the\nhighest in 2 1/2 months, from 351 yesterday, according to prices\nfrom CMA, a data provider. The price of default swaps rises when\ninvestor perceptions of the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness worsen.  \u2018Policy Battle\u2019  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank in Budapest raised the benchmark\ntwo-week deposit rate to 5.5 percent from a record-low 5.25\npercent, matching the forecast of two analysts in a Bloomberg\nsurvey. Sixteen predicted no change. Hungary is the first of the\nEU\u2019s eastern members to raise interest rates this year.  Industry taxes being levied to reduce the budget shortfall\nto less than 3 percent of output next year will raise the\ninflation rate by 0.3 percentage points next year, the central\nbank said on Nov. 11. Inflation has been climbing for two months\nto 4.2 percent in October, the highest level since June.  The central bank\u2019s decision may be part of a \u201cpolicy\nbattle\u201d with the government, which has urged looser monetary\nconditions, Win Thin, global head of emerging-markets strategy\nat Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, wrote in a note to\nclients.  \u2018Increasingly Worrying\u2019  The government has called on central bank President  Andras Simor  to resign and last week said it wants to strip him of the\nright to nominate rate-setters, giving parliament the power to\nselect future policy makers. The terms of four of the seven\nMonetary Council members will expire in March.  \u201cHungary is looking increasingly worrying, with the\nNational Bank of Hungary and the government at each other\u2019s\nthroats at the moment, just when global market conditions are\nlooking very difficult,\u201d Ash wrote in the RBS report. \u201cThese\ntwo institutions need to be pulling together at these difficult\ntimes, not against one another.\u201d  The BUX has led a selloff from New York to Shanghai since\nglobal shares peaked on Nov. 5 amid concern Europe\u2019s debt crisis\nand China\u2019s fight against inflation will slow global economic\ngrowth. The BUX has declined 20.1 percent from this year\u2019s high\non April 6, becoming the first emerging-market stock gauge to\nenter a so-called bear market since global equities began\nfalling this month.  The MSCI All-Country World Index , the benchmark index for\nshares in emerging and developed nations, has retreated 5.6\npercent from this year\u2019s Nov. 5 high as the market value of\nglobal shares declined by $2.3 trillion, according to data\ncompiled by  Bloomberg. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index  of shares\nin 21 developing countries fell 6.7 percent during the period.
