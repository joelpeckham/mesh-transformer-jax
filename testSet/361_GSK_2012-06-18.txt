 "context": "The following article called 'Gum Disease May Lead to Head, Neck Cancers, Study Finds' was published on 2012-06-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChronic gum disease may leave the\nmouth more susceptible to head and neck cancers caused by the\nhuman papillomavirus, a study found.  Of 124 patients diagnosed with the cancers in the study, 40\npercent had tumors that tested positive for a strain of human\npapillomavirus, research published online today in the  Archives\nof Otolaryngology -- Head & Neck Surgery  found.  About 10 percent of men and 3.6 percent of women are orally\ninfected with HPV, a virus usually transmitted through sexual\nactivity that may lead to cancer, according to a January study\nin the Journal of the  American Medical Association . Today\u2019s\nfindings show that dentists and doctors need to treat  chronic\ngum disease  to help reduce the likelihood the virus can infect\nthe mouth, the authors said.  \u201cWe have become increasingly aware of the HPV virus\ncausing this type of cancer and it shows why we need to be\naggressive in terms of our dental care,\u201d Dennis Kraus, director\nof Head and Neck Oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in  New York ,\nsaid today in a telephone interview. Kraus wasn\u2019t involved in\nthe study.  Kraus said while it\u2019s unclear why gum disease leaves people\nmore open to HPV, bacteria in the mouth may make it more\nsusceptible to the virus or it could be an immunological\nresponse.  Human papillomavirus is the most-common sexually\ntransmitted virus in the U.S., where half the population will be\ninfected at some time in their lives, according to the  Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention . It is known to cause\ncervical, vulvar, vaginal, penile and anal cancer.  Available Drugs  It\u2019s unknown whether  Merck & Co. (MRK) \u2019s Gardasil and\n GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) \u2019s Cervarix vaccines, which target genital\nHPV, will protect against oral infections.  Gardasil is approved for preventing cervical, vaginal and\nanal cancers and genital warts, and is recommended for girls and\nwomen 9 to 26 years old. It\u2019s also approved for genital warts\nand anal cancer in boys and men of the same ages. Cervarix is\napproved for preventing cervical cancer in females 9 to 25.  Researchers in the study looked at data from 124 patients\ndiagnosed from 1999 to 2007 with  cancers  of the oral cavity,\nwhich include the lips, part of the tongue and mouth,\noropharynx, which includes the back of the mouth, base of the\ntongue and the tonsils, and larynx, which includes the vocal\ncords.  They found that about 65 percent of the oropharyngeal\ncancers were HPV positive, compared with 29 percent of the oral\ncavity cancers and 21 percent of the laryngeal cancers.  Signs of Disease  Those who were HPV positive had higher rates of alveolar\nbone loss around the teeth, the researchers found. Each\nmillimeter of bone loss was associated with a 2.6 times\nincreased risk of a HPV-positive tumor.  \u201cIf you have gum disease, have treatment and keep up with\ngood oral hygiene,\u201d  Mine Tezal , the lead study author and an\nassistant professor at the University at Buffalo, the  State\nUniversity of New York , said today in an e-mail. \u201cPrevention or\ntreatment of sources of inflammation in the oral cavity may be a\nsimple yet effective way to reduce the acquisition and\npersistence of oral HPV infection.\u201d  The study was supported by grants from the  National Cancer\nInstitute  and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial\nResearch.
