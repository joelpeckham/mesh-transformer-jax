The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina\u2019s new  home prices  rose in\nDecember in the most cities in 20 months, renewing concerns that\nthe government may issue new tightening measures.  Prices climbed in 54 of the 70 cities the government tracks,\ncompared with 53 in November, according to data from the\nstatistics bureau today. Prices fell in eight cities, the data\nshowed. In April 2011, prices increased in 56 cities.  China should \u201cgradually\u201d set up a property tax system\nthat covers real estate transactions and ownership, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said during a visit to the  finance ministry  this week.\nThe government will stick to home-purchase restrictions and will\n\u201cstrictly\u201d curb speculative housing demand in 2013, the\nofficial Xinhua News Agency reported last month, citing the\nMinistry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development.  \u201cIf prices continue to rise and more rapidly in the next\nfew months, there is a danger that the government could be more\nworried and start to tighten again,\u201d  Wang Tao , chief China\neconomist at UBS AG, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in\nHong Kong today. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little bit too early to say the\nmarket is already overheating.\u201d  The southern business hub of Guangzhou led gains in\nDecember with a 1.2 percent increase from November, according to\ntoday\u2019s data. Among major cities, prices in Beijing and Shanghai\ngained 0.8 percent and 0.6 percent respectively.  \u2018Next Stage\u2019  The Shanghai Stock Exchange Property Index, a measure of\ndevelopers\u2019 shares on the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index,\nrose 3.1 percent at close of trading. The gauge  gained  37\npercent in the last 12 months,  outstripping  the 2.2 percent\nadvance in the benchmark.  China\u2019s housing sales rose 11 percent to 5.4 trillion  yuan \n($869 billion) last year from 2011, while investment in homes,\noffice buildings, malls and other real estate gained 16 percent\nto 7.2 trillion yuan, a separate government report today showed.  Home prices were unchanged in eight cities. They increased\nin 40 cities from a year earlier, compared with 25 cities in\nNovember, the home data showed.  \u201cThe recovery of the  property market  has already started\nbecause of eased liquidity,\u201d said Jinsong Du, a Hong Kong-based\nproperty analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG. \u201cThe government\nshould prevent prices from rising too fast in the next stage.\u201d  Existing home prices rose 1 percent in Beijing last month\nfrom November and increased 0.4 percent in Shanghai, today\u2019s\ndata showed.  \u2018Right Direction\u2019  In its almost three-year effort to tighten the property\nmarket, the government has raised down-payment and mortgage\nrequirements, imposed a property tax for the first time in\nShanghai and Chongqing, and enacted home-purchase restrictions\nin about 40 cities.  The market \u201cis moving into a right direction: Prices are\ngoing back up and the government is still sitting on it, which I\nthink is just the right thing to do,\u201d  Ronnie Chan , Chairman of\n Hang Lung Properties Ltd. (101) , the Hong Kong developer that\u2019s\ninvesting $8.5 billion on the mainland, said in an interview on\nBloomberg Television this week.
