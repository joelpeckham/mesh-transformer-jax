The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNo middleman in the industrialized\nworld is offering potential buyers a cheaper way to export wheat\nto  Asia  than  Australia \u2019s  GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC)   While Glencore International Plc\u2019s purchase of Viterra\nInc.\u2019s grain assets in Australia and  Canada  this month helped\nspur an  11 percent jump  in GrainCorp\u2019s shares on  takeover\nspeculation , the Sydney-based wheat handler still traded\nyesterday at 10.7 times profit, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. That\u2019s the lowest among agricultural product\nwholesalers valued at more than $500 million in developed\neconomies. It\u2019s also a 57 percent discount to Glencore\u2019s bid of\n24.9 times earnings for Viterra, the data show.  GrainCorp, which operates seven of the eight ports that\nship grain in bulk from Australia\u2019s east coast, has tripled its\nsales since the world\u2019s second-largest wheat exporting nation\nbegan deregulating the industry in 2006, and is projected by\nanalysts to report record profit this year. A takeover offer is\n\u201cinevitable,\u201d according to Citigroup Inc., and GrainCorp could\nlure a bid of A$2.2 billion ($2.3 billion), 23 percent more than\nyesterday\u2019s close, RBS Morgans Ltd. said.  \u201cGrainCorp is a strategic asset,\u201d said  Belinda Moore , a\nBrisbane-based analyst at RBS Morgans. \u201cWith  Viterra (VT)  going, and\nthe agriculture sector continuing to consolidate, there are\nfewer and fewer agriculture companies. It\u2019s the last significant\ncompany in Australia capable of being taken out.\u201d  GrainCorp rose 0.6 percent to  A$9.05 a share , its highest\nclose since June 2008, after reaching a high of A$9.12 today.  Virtual Monopoly  \u201cWe\u2019re just going to focus on running the business as well\nas we can,\u201d GrainCorp Chief Executive Officer Alison Watkins\nsaid in an interview in  Melbourne  today. \u201cI think it\u2019s\nflattering that everyone thinks we\u2019re so attractive.\u201d  GrainCorp, which traces its roots to 1916 and the Grain\nElevators Board of the New South Wales state agriculture\ndepartment, handles as much as 60 percent of eastern Australia\u2019s\ngrain crop and has about 20 million metric tons of storage at\nmore than 280 inland grain handling sites, according to the\ncompany.  Its revenue has surged since Australia\u2019s 2006 decision to\nstrip AWB Ltd. of an export monopoly, after an inquiry found it\nwas among firms that made illegal payments to win contracts from\nthe former Iraq regime of Saddam Hussein under the  United\nNations \u2019 oil-for-food program.  With GrainCorp owning the silos where farmers dump their\nharvests, railroad cars that carry loads to east coast ports,\nand the elevators used to load ships, the deregulation gave the\ncompany a \u201cvirtual, natural monopoly\u201d on the eastern seaboard,\naccording to Justin Crosby, a policy director at the Sydney-\nbased  NSW Farmers\u2019 Association , which represents 10,000 members,\nhalf of them grain growers.  \u2018Deliver Your Wheat\u2019  In the five-year period ended in September 2006, revenue at\nGrainCorp rose 60 percent, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. In the five years since, sales have risen 242 percent\nto  A$2.8 billion , the data show.  \u201cThere\u2019s very little competition in New South Wales\noutside of GrainCorp,\u201d Crosby said. \u201cThere is a great deal of\nmarket power held by GrainCorp with regards to where you can\ndeliver your wheat.\u201d  As of yesterday, GrainCorp had risen 11 percent since\nViterra said on March 9 that it was approached by possible\nbuyers. The closing price of A$9 a share yesterday valued the\ncompany at  10.7 times  profit, making GrainCorp the cheapest of\nfive agricultural products wholesalers worth more than $500\nmillion in the U.S., Western Europe, and developed Asia,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. The companies fetch an\naverage of 23.1 times earnings, and Glencore\u2019s C$16.25 a share\noffer is 24.9 times  Viterra\u2019s earnings , the data show.  Billionaire Stakeholder  Less than a week after Viterra\u2019s disclosure, Australian\nbillionaire  James Packer  raised his stake in GrainCorp to 6.2\npercent, becoming the company\u2019s  largest shareholder , according\nto stock exchange filings. Brian O\u2019Sullivan, a director at\nEllerston Capital Ltd., the fund that holds the stake, didn\u2019t\nreturn calls seeking comment on the investment.  A buyer of GrainCorp would be drawn by many of the same\nfactors that drove Glencore\u2019s C$6.1 billion ($6.1 billion) offer\nfor Regina, Saskatchewan-based Viterra, which was made with\nCanada\u2019s  Agrium Inc. (AGU)  and Richardson International Ltd.,\naccording to Citigroup analyst Tim Mitchell. Agrium will buy\nmost of Viterra\u2019s retail facilities in Canada and Australia and\na stake in Canadian Fertilizer Ltd., while Richardson will\npurchase a stake in Viterra\u2019s Canadian grain-handling assets as\nwell as some other North American operations.  \u201cWhat really attracted us to Viterra is the asset base, a\nsuperb set of assets, elevators, port facilities, processing\nplants in Australia and in Canada,\u201d Chris Mahoney, Glencore\u2019s\ndirector of agricultural products, said on a March 20 conference\ncall about the deal.  Glencore, Gavilon  People familiar with the matter said this month that\n Glencore (GLEN)  had also expressed an interest in closely held Gavilon\nGroup LLC as the Omaha, Nebraska-based grain handler weighed a\nsale that could fetch as much as $5 billion. While Singapore-\nbased  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL)  and  Japan \u2019s Mitsui & Co. also\nexpressed an interest, Gavilon discouraged  Cargill  Inc. of\nMinneapolis and Decatur, Illinois-based  Archer Daniels  Midland\nCo. because of antitrust risk, the people said. Japan\u2019s  Marubeni\nCorp. (8002)  may also be interested, Reuters reported March 21.  Glencore forecasts annual global demand growth for grains\nand oilseeds of as much as 3.5 percent to be driven by Asia,\nMahoney said on the call.  Indonesia , where demand for wheat has\nrisen more than  50 percent  in the past decade, has surpassed\nJapan as Asia\u2019s largest importer of the grain, according to the\n U.S. Department of Agriculture .  \u2018Luxury Foods\u2019  Forecasting global wheat exports will double to more than\n225 million metric tons by 2050, GrainCorp said demand will come\nfrom established markets in Asia, the  Middle East  and North\n Africa  which already import half their grain, as well as new\ndemand from sub-Saharan Africa and the Asian subcontinent,\naccording to a March 28 filing to Australia\u2019s stock exchange.  The growth will come in large part because of demand for\nprotein from increasingly rich consumers, said  David Leyonhjelm ,\ndirector of Baron Strategic Services, a Sydney-based\nagricultural consultancy.  \u201cAs incomes rise, dietary preferences head toward what are\nperceived to be luxury foods, and that\u2019s animal products,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cGrain is a key feedstock ingredient. Even if it\u2019s not\nbeing used to make bread and pasta, it will be used to make\nstock feed.\u201d  Australia was the world\u2019s second-biggest wheat exporter in\n2011, according to the USDA, and GrainCorp earnings may rise to\na record A$185 million in the year ending September, according\nto the March 28 filing.  \u2018Critical Mass\u2019  With Viterra sold, AWB acquired by Agrium in 2010, and\nanother large rival,  CBH Group , owned by a co-operative of 4,500\nfarmers in Western Australia, global commodity traders from\n Archer Daniels (ADM)  to Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Corp. are running\nout of alternatives in Australia, Leyonhjelm said.  GrainCorp would \u201cmake sense\u201d as a target for any of the\nthree companies, he said. \u201cGrainCorp is the only one left if\nyou want critical mass fairly easily.\u201d  Spokesmen for Archer Daniels, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus all\ndeclined to comment. Archer Daniels said last week that it\ndecided not to bid for Viterra after considering it. Cargill,\nwhich acquired AWB\u2019s commodity trading business from Agrium in\n2010, said this month that its Canadian market share stopped it\nfrom bidding for Viterra.  GrainCorp also owns a Canadian maker of malt used for\n whiskey and beer , which means it stands to profit from the end\nof a 69-year-old wheat and barley monopoly held by the Canadian\nWheat Board, Citigroup\u2019s Mitchell wrote in a March 12 note.  Relative Value  Starting Aug. 1 farmers in western Canada will be able to\nsell to any buyer, rather than only the Canadian Wheat Board,\nwhich Viterra has said will boost its market share and profits.  GrainCorp could be worth A$11.11 a share to a buyer, or\nabout A$2.4 billion including the value of its debt, according\nto RBS Morgans\u2019s Moore. That\u2019s 9 times Moore\u2019s forecast for\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\nof A$265.5 million in 2014, which reflects an \u201caverage season\u201d\nfor the company.  Glencore\u2019s offer values Viterra at 11 times  expected 2012\nEbitda . Applied to Moore\u2019s 2014 Ebitda target, that multiple\nwould value GrainCorp at A$13.94 a share. Because GrainCorp is\nsmaller than Viterra, a lower multiple is more appropriate, with\n9 times being the \u201caverage for Australian agribusinesses,\u201d\nMoore wrote in a March 21 research note.  Applying the same 9 times Ebitda multiple to GrainCorp\u2019s\n\u201csustainable\u201d earnings of about A$260 million, Citigroup\u2019s\nMitchell says the company is worth about A$11 a share in a\ntakeover. For the current year, GrainCorp is forecasting Ebitda\nof between A$350 million and A$380 million.  Make a Move  Buyers may wait for a pullback in the grain harvest, which\nhas pushed GrainCorp\u2019s earnings beyond levels likely in the long\nterm, said James Ferrier, an analyst at  Wilson HTM Investment\nGroup (WIG)  in Melbourne.  \u201cIf GrainCorp was to get a bid, it would more likely\nhappen when the weather cycle turns and we go back into a few\ndry years, similar to the scenario when Viterra acquired ABB\nGrain,\u201d he said.  The A$1.9 billion purchase of South Australia-focused ABB\nGrain Ltd. was struck in May 2009, after two drought-affected\nharvests. Including the value of ABB\u2019s debt, Viterra paid 17\ntimes Ebitda, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The\ncompany touted the acquisition\u2019s potential to \u201cprovide greater\nexposure to the higher-growth Asian import market,\u201d according\nto a statement at the time.  Australia has one of the world\u2019s most variable rainfall\nclimates, with three good years and three bad years every\ndecade, according to the nation\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology. Last\nyear was Australia\u2019s  third-wettest  year on record.  Still, takeovers in Australia will continue, said Mike Chaseling, deputy chairman of grain trader Emerald Group\nAustralia Pty.  \u201cThe big question, post-Viterra, is does somebody look to\nmake a move on GrainCorp?\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it stops\nhere.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAngus Whitley in Sydney at \n awhitley1@bloomberg.net ;\nPhoebe Sedgman in Melbourne at \n psedgman2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nDaniel Hauck at \n dhauck1@bloomberg.net ;\nKatherine Snyder at \n ksnyder@bloomberg.net ;\nPhilip Lagerkranser at \n lagerkranser@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ABB Ltd was 13.942462921142578 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ABB Ltd was ",
