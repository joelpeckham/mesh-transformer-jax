The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRichard\u2019s Bay Coal Terminal on  South\nAfrica \u2019s eastern coast shipped the most fuel in 2012 for six\nyears as U.S. exports pushed down prices while demand held for\nhigher-quality African coal.  Shipments rose 4.3 percent to 68.3 million metric tons, the\nhighest level since 2006, according to Bloomberg calculations\nbased on data published today on the company\u2019s  website .  \u201cI think that there\u2019s a combination of quality and price\nthat makes it attractive to buyers,\u201d said Xavier Prevost at XMP\nConsulting in Pretoria. \u201cThe mines were not willing to produce\nmore because the price was very low.\u201d  Spot prices for coal shipped from Richards Bay reached an\nannual low of $79.87 a ton on Nov. 2, according to data on\nBloomberg provided by IHS McCloskey. They have risen 11 percent\nsince to $88.94. Prices averaged $92.89 in 2012, 20 percent\ncheaper than 2011\u2019s $116.20, according to IHS McCloskey.  \u201cA lot of the coal that Americans were supposed to sell\nremained, so they decided to go into a very aggressive export,\u201d\nPrevost said. Many of the buyers in China,  India  and  Europe \npreferred the higher quality coal from South Africa, he said.  Total U.S. coal exports for the quarter ended June rose to\n the highest level  on record, according to the Energy Department.  The port, whose owners include  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and  Anglo\nAmerican Plc (AAL) , has capacity to export 91 million tons annually.\nIt had 3.3 million tons of stockpiles at the end of the year,\nnearly double the 1.7 million tons at the end of 2010.
