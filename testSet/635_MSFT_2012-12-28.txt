 "context": "The following article called 'Weak Windows 8 Demand Saps PC Sales, Fujitsu President Says' was published on 2012-12-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFujitsu Ltd. (6702) ,  Japan \u2019s biggest provider of computer services, said the company will miss its annual shipment target for personal computers amid slow demand for  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) \u2019s Windows 8 operating system.  Initial appetite for the software, introduced in October, is \u201cweak,\u201d Fujitsu President Masami Yamamoto, 58, told reporters in Tokyo yesterday. Slumping demand in  Europe  amid the sovereign-debt crisis will also erode sales, he said. PC deliveries for the year ending March 31 may be more than 6 million units, compared with an October  estimate  of 7 million, he said.  U.S. retail sales of devices running Windows fell 21 percent from a year earlier in the four weeks after Microsoft released Windows 8 on Oct. 26, according to a Nov. 29  report  by Port  Washington , New York-based NPD Group Inc. The decrease has been fueled by a 24 percent drop in sales of notebook computers as customers opt for Apple Inc.\u2019s iPad or tablets powered by Google Inc.\u2019s Android software.  \u201cWe can\u2019t be optimistic about the PC industry,\u201d said Yoshihisa Toyosaki, a Tokyo-based analyst at Architect Grand Design, an electronics research and consulting company. \u201cPC makers\u2019 bet on Windows 8 has failed, as cheaper tablet computers are taking away customers.\u201d  Fujitsu is focusing on information technology services, helping it weather a slump in electronics  sales  that contributed to record losses at  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Panasonic Corp. (6752)  and  Sharp Corp. (6753)  Yamamoto said his company doesn\u2019t plan to lower prices for its PCs, which along with mobile phones accounted for a combined 20 percent of Fujitsu\u2019s revenue in the year ended March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Strengthening Services  \u201cFujitsu doesn\u2019t plan to join its competitors that are discounting\u201d to sustain sales, Yamamoto said. The  company  needs to strengthen its services in overseas markets, shifting from a product-focused approach, he said.  The company had said earlier it was counting on shipments in Europe and other overseas markets to account for more than half of total PC sales in the current fiscal year.  Fujitsu, a supplier to  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , fell 0.8 percent to 360 yen at the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock has declined 10 percent this year, compared with a 23 percent gain in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Microsoft advanced 0.4 percent in  New York  trading yesterday and has gained 3.9 percent this year.  Restructuring Plan  Dell Inc. (DELL) , the world\u2019s third-largest PC maker, said Dec. 12 it\u2019s seeing strong demand for computers and tablets running Windows 8. Interest in the operating system is \u201cquite high,\u201d Dell Chief Executive Officer  Michael Dell  said at a conference in Austin,  Texas .  Microsoft plans to overhaul how it develops its flagship Windows operating system in a strategic shift aimed at keeping pace with nimbler rivals Apple and Google, people familiar with the matter said last month.  Microsoft aims to upgrade the software more frequently, about once a year, rather than every two or three years as it\u2019s done in the past, the people said. The world\u2019s largest software maker has floundered as personal computers, where it has long dominated, have lost ground to the smartphones and tablets championed by Apple and Google.  Fujitsu, the maker of the K supercomputer, will decide on a restructuring plan for its unprofitable chip business by March 31, Yamamoto said, declining to provide details. The  company  is trying to rely more on other companies to make its chips instead of running its own chip-fabrication plants.  LSI Chips  Fujitsu is among Japanese companies suffering from plunging demand for LSI chips used in televisions, along with Panasonic and Sharp.  To stem a drop in profits, Fujitsu plans to reduce costs by 1 trillion yen ($11.6 billion) in three years from the 12 months ending March 31, 2013, Yamamoto said. The measures include lowering purchasing costs and relocating system engineers to other divisions, he said.  Fujitsu lowered its  net income forecast  in October by 58 percent to 25 billion yen for the year ending March 31. That would be its third straight year of declining  profit  as a worsening European economy dents demand for its computers and services, including system integration and cloud computing.
