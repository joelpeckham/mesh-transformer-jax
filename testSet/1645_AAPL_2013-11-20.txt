Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage  NetApp Sues Ex-Employees, Nimble Storage Over Trade Secrets  NetApp Inc. (NTAP) , a provider of data storage and management\nproducts and services, sued a competitor and three former\nemployees for trade secret misappropriation.  Nimble Storage Inc., of San Jose, California, is accused of\nrecruiting NetApp employees to obtain that company\u2019s trade\nsecrets. Fifteen percent of Nimble\u2019s workforce and half of its\nexecutive staff are former NetApp employees, according to the\ncomplaint.  Sunnyvale, California-based NetApp claims that Nimble\ntrades on NetApp\u2019s fame by telling customers that its technology\nteams include former NetApp employees. The former employees,\nNetApp said, downloaded confidential company information before\nthey left and brought it with them to Nimble.  In addition to trade secret misappropriation, Nimble and\nthe former NetApp employees are accused of conspiring to violate\nthe Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to give Nimble a competitive\nadvantage. The former employees are also accused of violating\ntheir employment contracts with NetApp.  Dan Leary, Nimble\u2019s vice president of worldwide marketing,\nsaid in an e-mailed statement that his company will investigate\nNetApp\u2019s claims and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d any that are \u201cfalse\nand unsubstantial.\u201d  NetApp asked the court to bar the use of its trade secrets\nand to grant access to laptops, hard drives, external storage\nmedia and Nimble\u2019s computer systems and servers to verify the\nextent and nature of NetApp materials stored there.

Patents  Silicon Valley Invents Way Around Washington Gridlock on Patents  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , two California technology\ncompanies on opposite sides of a  Washington  debate over U.S.\npatent law, may soon take their fight closer to home.  The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is pushing forward\nwith plans to open a fully operational satellite office in San\nJose, after congressional budget cuts put them on hold earlier\nthis year. The work-around came about after San Jose city\nofficials pledged free rent and California donated $500,000.  The permanent office, which may open by the end of next\nyear, will be where West Coast inventors submit applications to\nget legal protection for their ideas. It will also serve as a\nhub where companies -- even startups -- can bring their\npositions on patent law directly to the administration without a\ncross-country flight.  \u201cIt will mean an easier and clearer channel of\ncommunication both ways -- from the PTO to the public and from\nthe public to the PTO,\u201d said Michelle Lee, a former Google\nexecutive who\u2019s now director of the Silicon Valley office.  The agency\u2019s temporary location, at an office in Menlo\nPark, houses Lee and nine administrative law judges who hear\narguments about the validity of issued patents. With a permanent\nspace, the patent office plans to have a total staff of more\nthan 80, with 20 judges and 60 patent examiners.  A key role in the patent office is in helping develop\nadministration policy on intellectual property. The technology\nindustry is split on proposals before Congress that could change\nthe rules for patent litigation. Mountain View, California-based\nGoogle is backing the proposals. Qualcomm, based at the southern\nend of the state in San Diego, says some of the ideas being\nconsidered could curtail innovation, particularly by startups.  Both companies are funding lobbying groups that are trying\nto influence Congress. Smaller companies in Silicon Valley don\u2019t\nalways have that option. Lee said the local office has already\nheld roundtable discussions about policy regarding patents on\nsoftware.  Apple Asks Jury to Use Common Sense in Samsung Damages Trial  An  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  lawyer told jurors common sense would lead\nthem to conclude Samsung Electronics Co. should pay $380 million\nfor infringement of some of the iPhone-maker\u2019s patents.  William Lee of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP gave\nhis closing argument yesterday in federal court in San Jose,\nCalifornia, where Apple won a $1.05 billion verdict against\nSamsung last year. His client is attempting to recoup most of\nthe $410.5 million, or 39 percent, of the award that U.S.\nDistrict Judge Lucy Koh cut in March.  Jurors should apply their \u201ccollective judgment\u201d to the\ncompanies\u2019 actions to \u201cfocus on what they actually did in the\nreal world\u201d and not \u201cwhat they could\u2019ve done,\u201d Lee said.  While Samsung is \u201ctelling you these patents are narrow and\ninsignificant,\u201d historical documents tell the truth, said Lee,\nwho was on Apple\u2019s legal team last year. \u201cDocuments don\u2019t\nlie.\u201d  William C. Price of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP,\nan attorney for Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung, has argued\nthat jurors should award Cupertino, California-based Apple $52\nmillion, which he called \u201cnot a trivial sum.\u201d  \u201cApple has tried to mischaracterize these patents so they\nare the iPhone,\u201d Price told the jury today. \u201cThese patents are\nvery narrow.\u201d  An appeals court in Washington ruled Nov. 18 that Apple can\nseek a ban on sales of some Samsung products found to infringe\npatents covering smartphone features, such as multitouch\ntechnology, that were at issue in the 2012 trial. The company\ncan\u2019t block Samsung products for infringing patented designs,\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said.  A decision on damages will conclude the first U.S. case\nbetween the two companies over claims they are copying each\nother\u2019s features in their global battle for dominance of the\nsmartphone market.  The case is Apple Inc. v.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Ltd., 11-cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California\n(San Jose).  For more patent news, click here.
