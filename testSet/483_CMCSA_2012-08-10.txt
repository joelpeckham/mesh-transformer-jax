The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUnivision  Communications Inc., the\nbiggest U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster, broke into the top 25\nmost-watched shows for the first time with \u201cLa Que No Podia\nAmar,\u201d drawing viewers not interested in the Olympics.  Three episodes of the telenovela, which translates into\n\u201cThe One Who Couldn\u2019t Love,\u201d ranked among the most-watched\nprime-time shows in the week ended Aug. 5, according to Nielsen\ndata. The top seven slots went to Olympics coverage on  Comcast\nCorp. (CMCSA) \u2019s NBC. The series finale airs tonight.  NBC\u2019s Olympics telecast has pulled viewers from the other\nEnglish language networks, opening the door for Univision and\nSpanish-speaking audiences not keen on sports. Since the London\nGames began, Univision is the only broadcaster other than NBC to\ngain share among the younger viewers marketers target, the\ncompany said in a statement, citing Nielsen.  \u201cThey are closing the gap,\u201d said  Brad Adgate , head of\nresearch at  Horizon Media , a New York-based advertising company.\n\u201cThey are more apt to be a stronger contender in the summer\nwhen the English language networks are airing repeats.\u201d  The network\u2019s telenovela was produced by Mexico City-based\nGrupo Televisa SAB, a major program supplier and investor in\nUnivision, and has aired on the network since February. Set on a\ncattle ranch, the soap opera stars Jorge Salinas, Jose Ron,\nSusana Gonzalez and Ana Brenda, according to  Univision .  Over five episodes last week, Univision drew an average\n4.87 million viewers a night, Nielsen data show. That compares\nwith an average prime-time audience of 3.61 million nightly for\nthe full season. That placed Univision third in total audience,\nbehind NBC and  CBS Corp. (CBS)  The network ranked second in the 18-\nto-49-year-old group that advertisers target.  Audience Surge  Univision, based in New York, was acquired in 2007 for\n$12.6 billion by Saban Capital Group Inc., Madison Dearborn\nPartners LLC, Providence Equity Partners Inc., TPG Capital and\nThomas H. Lee Partners LP.  In the last two weeks, the total audience for \u201cLa Que No\nPodia Amar\u201d has surged by 509,000 viewers compared with the\naverage during the program\u2019s seven-month run, Univision said in\nthe statement.  The show has also ranked as the highest non-Olympic\nprogram, or the second-highest behind NBC\u2019s broadcasts, on\nweeknights among viewers ages 18 to 49, a group targeted by\nadvertisers, Univision said.  Latinos represent 16 percent of the  U.S. population , a\nnumber that may almost double to 30 percent by 2050, Univision\nsaid in May when it unveiled plans to start an English-language\nnetwork for Hispanics with  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) \u2019s ABC News. The\ncompany faces competition from new entrants, including  News\nCorp. (NWSA) \u2019s Mundo Fox and Comcast\u2019s El Rey, along with established\nrivals like Telemundo, also part of Comcast.  \u201cTheir audience will become more fragmented,\u201d Adgate\nsaid. \u201cThe ratings will flatten out a little bit.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAndy Fixmer in  Los Angeles  at \n afixmer@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAnthony Palazzo at \n apalazzo@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Comcast Corporation - Class A was 14.560449600219727 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Comcast Corporation - Class A was ",
