The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Czech Republic\u2019s $10 billion\nplan to build two atomic reactors near the German border that\ncould supply electricity to the Bavarian industrial heartland is\nunraveling over financial and pricing disputes.  CEZ AS (CEZ) ,  Europe \u2019s only utility with an  atomic project  out to\nbid, is beset by falling power prices and predictions that its\nfinancial muscle is too weak to safeguard investors. The Prague-\nbased power company\u2019s two most senior executives clashed last\nmonth on how to fund the reactors.  \u201cThe project simply won\u2019t be financially profitable,\u201d said\nIvan Kotev, an analyst with Prague-based advisory firm  Candole\nPartners  who co-wrote an economic feasibility study of the plan\nin January. \u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic,\u201d Kotev said in an interview.  The developments are a blow to nuclear contractors  Areva SA (AREVA) \nof France,  Toshiba Corp. (6502) \u2019s Westinghouse unit and a Russian-Czech\nconsortium. Each is preparing bids by a July deadline that will\noffer to build their latest model of reactor which, in each\ncase, has yet to run at an operating nuclear station.  CEZ and the state insist they will proceed with the\nproject. That\u2019s a break from  Germany , Switzerland and  Italy ,\nwhich closed nuclear plants or canceled projects last year after\nthe Fukushima disaster in  Japan . CEZ wants to build the power\ngenerators at its existing two-reactor Temelin plant.  Germany\u2019s plan to shut down all of its 17 nuclear reactors\nby 2022 will create need for more reliable electricity sources\nin Europe, according to Matthias Heck, a Frankfurt-based energy\nanalyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. Temelin stands less than 40\nmiles (64 kilometers) from the border with Bavaria, the German\nstate that\u2019s home to carmaker BMW AG and engineer Siemens AG.  Unreliable Clean Power  \u201cIn the longer term, there will be a need for new plants\nproducing baseload power,\u201d Heck said in a telephone interview,\nreferring to electricity delivered around-the-clock. \u201cRenewables\nare growing fast, but they are unreliable. Nuclear is a backbone\nof power generation.\u201d  The Temelin project may not be able to pay itself off given\nlow prices of power and carbon dioxide allowances, which aren\u2019t\nexpensive enough to encourage utilities to switch to emission-\nfree technology, Macquarie\u2019s Heck said.  Czech  power prices  for next-year have declined 5 percent\nin the past year to about 50.75 euros a megawatt-hour.  German power prices for next year, a regional benchmark,\nhave declined 10.1 percent in the past year to about 52.50 a\nmegawatt-hour. Carbon emission permits have dropped 54 percent\nin the same period to just more than 8 euros a ton.  Shares in CEZ have dropped about 2.4 percent in the past 12\nmonths, compared with a 2 percent gain in the  Dow Jones Emerging\nMarkets Titans Utilities 30 index .  7 Billion-Euro Financing  To pay for Temelin, CEZ would have to borrow more than 7\nbillion euros ($9.1 billion), which would raise its debt-to-\nequity ratio above the average among its European peers,\naccording to the Candole research.  Both CEZ and the Czech government -- which controls 70\npercent of the company\u2019s shares -- say they are determined to\nsee the project through. Yet they are sending confusing signals\nabout how they plan to pay for it.  CEZ Chief Financial Officer Martin Novak said in an\ninterview last month that the company may consider bringing in\nanother investor to share the risk. He was rebuffed by Chief\nExecutive Officer Daniel Benes, who told Bloomberg on Feb. 28\nthat \u201cthere is no other plan\u201d than to finance Temelin entirely\nout of CEZ\u2019s pocket.  Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kuba said in a Feb. 12\nTV debate that CEZ should finance the expansion on its own even\nif it means paying out a smaller dividend.  Outside Investor?  \u201cBringing in an outside investor is an option that CEZ\nwould be wise to explore,\u201d said Bram Buring, an analyst at\nPrague-based brokerage Wood & Co. \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon that\ninvestments of this scope are shared. CEZ would be foolish to\nclose any options.\u201d  CEZ\u2019s  dividend  policy has been to pay out between 50 and 60\npercent of net profit. The company pays about $1 billion a year\nto the state budget, about 2 percent of the  Czech Republic \u2019s\nyearly revenue. Slashing the dividend would put a dent in the\nstate\u2019s coffers.  The enormous price tag, probably combined with high\ninsurance premiums and interest rates, will make it necessary\nfor CEZ to seek state help at the expense of consumers and small\nshareholders, Kotev said.  CEZ is exploring ways to make the state share the risk by\ngiving guarantees on loans and setting purchase price of\nelectricity produced in nuclear plants, according to Novak.  \u201cCEZ\u2019s main shareholder is the state, and the state is not\nalways a rational investor,\u201d Kotev said. \u201cThis is not a good\ndeal for minority shareholders.\u201d  Westinghouse, Rosatom  The company, with a $23 billion market value, the seventh-\nlargest European Union power utility by that measure, plans to\npick a contractor to build the reactors next year.  Areva is competing against Westinghouse Electric Corp. and\na Russian-Czech consortium led by Rosatom Corp.\u2019s unit\nAtomstroyexport for the contract.  CEZ\u2019s technical requirements are \u201cvery tough,\u201d said\nThomas Epron, Areva\u2019s manager for the Temelin project.  Areva is offering its 1,650-megawatt EPR reactor, currently\nunder construction in Finland and  France . Both projects are\nyears behind schedule and over budget by billions of euros\nWestinghouse is pitching its AP1000 design and Rosatom is\noffering to build the VVER 1200 design.  The Russian company is also facing delays at its Rostov\nproject. All three companies must submit their bids by July.  Even with the bidding process well under way, it\u2019s not\ncertain that CEZ will end up choosing any of the three\nsuppliers, said Vaclav Bartuska, the Czech government\u2019s special\nenvoy for nuclear energy.  The Czechs  want to see the reactors up\nand running before they make a decision, and that\u2019s not the case\nwith any of the designs so far, he said.  \u201cThere is a possibility that CEZ won\u2019t accept any of the\nbids,\u201d he said in an interview in Prague. \u201cTo be honest, at\nthis point not one of the three bidders has convinced us he can\nbuild on cost and on time.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nLadka Bauerova in Paris at \n lbauerova@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Will Kennedy  at \n wkennedy3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of EPR Properties was 26.11385726928711 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of EPR Properties was ",
