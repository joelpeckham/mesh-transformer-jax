 "context": "The following article called 'Countrywide, UBS, JPMorgan, Goldman in Court News' was published on 2010-04-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCountrywide Financial Corp.\ninvestors, led by a group of New York retirement funds, agreed\nto settle a class-action lawsuit for more than $600 million, a\nperson familiar with the case said.  \n U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in  Los Angeles  in\nDecember certified a class of investors who bought Countrywide\nshares or certain debt securities from March 12, 2004, to March\n7, 2008. The U.S. appeals court in  San Francisco  on April 19\ndenied the defendants permission to appeal that ruling. No\nsettlement papers have been filed.  \n Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for  Bank of America Corp .,\nwhich acquired Countrywide in 2008, declined to comment on April\n23. Jennifer Bankston, a spokeswoman for Labaton Sucharow LLP,\nthe firm representing the pension funds, said mediation between\nthe parties took place this month and declined to comment on the\nsettlement.  \n The New York State Common Retirement Fund and five New York\nCity pension funds claimed former Countrywide Chief Executive\nOfficer  Angelo Mozilo  and other executives hid from them that\nthe company was fueling its growth by letting underwriting\nstandards deteriorate. Bank of America acquired Calabasas,\nCalifornia-based Countrywide, which was the biggest U.S. home\nlender, in July 2008.  \n David Siegel, a lawyer for Mozilo, didn\u2019t immediately\nreturn a call seeking comment.  \n The class-action lawsuit names 50 defendants, including\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nand 23 other Countrywide underwriters. It also named the\nauditing firm KPMG LLP. The underwriters and KPMG are accused of\nsecurities-law violations and not fraud.  \n Dean Kitchens, a lawyer representing the underwriters, and\nTodd Gordinier, a lawyer representing KPMG, didn\u2019t immediately\nreturn calls seeking comment April 23.  \n The case is In re Countrywide Financial Corp. Securities\nLitigation, 07-05295, U.S. District Court, Central District of\nCalifornia (Los Angeles).  \n UBS to Pay $217 Million to Settle HealthSouth Case  \n UBS AG agreed to pay $217 million to  HealthSouth Corp .\nshareholders and bondholders to settle litigation they brought\nafter an accounting fraud was discovered at the health-care\nservices provider.  \n The settlements between UBS, Switzerland\u2019s biggest bank,\nand the securities holders were entered in the case docket April\n22. The shareholders will receive $117 million and the\nbondholders $100 million. In addition, Ernst & Young LLP,\nHealthSouth\u2019s accounting firm, agreed to pay the bondholders\n$33.5 million. It settled with the shareholders last year for\n$109 million.  \n The litigation stems from a $2.7 billion fraud at\nHealthSouth that led to guilty pleas from 15 executives,\nincluding five former finance chiefs. The fraud unraveled in\nMarch 2003 when federal agents raided the offices of Birmingham,\nAlabama-based HealthSouth, the largest U.S. provider of\ninpatient rehabilitation services. The discovery caused a drop\nin the company\u2019s share price that wiped out almost $6 billion in\nmarket value.  \n \u201cWe believe these substantial settlements reflect a great\nresult for bond purchasers who were damaged as a result of the\nmassive fraud at HealthSouth,\u201d David Bronner, chief executive\nofficer of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, the lead\nbondholder plaintiff, said in an e-mailed statement.  \n In settling, both Zurich-based UBS, HealthSouth\u2019s\ninvestment bank, and New York-based Ernst & Young denied\nwrongdoing. U.S. District Judge Karon Bowdre in Birmingham must\napprove the agreements.  \n \u201cUBS continues to deny all charges of wrongdoing or\nliability arising out of its engagement for HealthSouth,\u201d\nKristopher Kagel, a spokesman for the company, said in an e-\nmailed statement. \u201cAs established in multiple proceedings,\nHealthSouth\u2019s corrupt insiders repeatedly lied to UBS bankers.\nThis settlement is fully funded by insurance, except for a less\nthan 3 percent co-insurance payment by UBS.\u201d  \n The case is In re HealthSouth Securities Litigation,\n03cv1500, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama\n(Birmingham).  \n For more, click here.  \n Ex-Watchmaker Barouh Gets 10 Months in UBS Tax Case  \n Jack Barouh, a former watchmaker and ex  UBS AG  client, was\nsentenced to 10 months in prison, the longest term given any\ncustomer of the bank since the U.S. began a crackdown on\noffshore tax evasion.  \n Barouh, 65, admitted in February that he skimmed money from\nhis company and didn\u2019t report income on $10 million in assets,\nincluding $6 million in offshore accounts at UBS. Barouh\u2019s\nlawyer asked for a sentence of a year\u2019s home detention, saying\nBarouh is the son of Holocaust survivors who taught him to\n\u201chide and hoard\u201d and compulsively \u201cwant to establish a secret\nnest egg.\u201d Prosecutors asked April 16 for a 15-month prison\nterm.  \n U.S. District Judge Adalberto Jordan granted leniency,\nsaying Barouh cooperated with prosecutors probing offshore tax\nevasion and tried to voluntarily disclose his account to the\nInternal Revenue Service. Still, the judge said, Barouh deserved\nprison for his conduct.  \n \u201cHe did this for many years, hiding tens of millions of\ndollars,\u201d Jordan said in federal court in Miami.  \n Barouh is among 11 UBS clients who pleaded guilty to tax\ncrimes since the Zurich-based bank agreed in February 2009 to\npay $780 million to avoid prosecution for helping wealthy\nAmericans evade taxes. Since then, six other clients have been\nsentenced. Four got probation or home detention, one got two\nmonths in prison and another was sentenced to one month.  \n The case is U.S. v. Barouh, 10-cr-20034, U.S. District\nCourt, Southern District of Florida (Miami).  \n For more, click here.  \n FSA Asks Calvert to Forfeit $1.5 Million in Insider-Trade Case  \n   Malcolm Calvert , the former partner at  JPMorgan Chase &\nCo .\u2019s Cazenove unit who is serving a 21-month sentence for\ninsider trading, may have to forfeit about 1 million pounds\n($1.5 million), a London court heard April 23.  \n The U.K. financial regulator asked Judge Peter Testar to\nrule that Calvert must pay 473,955 pounds for confiscation of\nhis profits from trades made with inside information, plus\ninterest; and another 482,908 pounds in costs for his\nprosecution. Calvert\u2019s attorney, Hugo Keith, argued the\n Financial Services Authority  calculated the forfeiture amount\nincorrectly, and that the agency\u2019s costs were \u201cgrotesque.\u201d  \n Calvert, who arrived at court April 23 from Ford Open\nPrison in a grey sweater and pants, was convicted last month in\nthe FSA\u2019s third criminal insider-trading case to reach a jury\ntrial.  \n For more, click here.  \n For the latest verdict and settlement news, click here.  \n New Suits  \n Lehman Investors Add Auditor Ernst & Young to Suit Over Deals  \n   Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc .\u2019s auditor Ernst & Young LLP\nwas added as a defendant in a lawsuit seeking to recover money\nfrom former executives and underwriters for failing to disclose\nRepo 105 transactions.  \n The investor lawsuit, amended to add findings contained in\na 2,200-page report published March 11 by Lehman bankruptcy\nexaminer Anton Valukus, was filed April 23 on behalf of a group\nof retirement funds including the Alameda County Employees\u2019\nRetirement Association in Oakland, California, and the\nGovernment of  Guam Retirement Fund .  \n \u201cThroughout our period as the auditor of Lehman, we firmly\nbelieve our work met all applicable professional standards,\napplying the rules that existed at the time,\u201d Charlie Perkins,\nan Ernst & Young spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  \n The investors, in their original lawsuit filed in June 2008\nin federal court in Manhattan, claimed that New York-based\nLehman made false statements about liquidity, failed to take\ntimely writedowns of its positions on mortgage-backed securities\nand overstated their value. Defendants in the case include\nformer Lehman Chief Executive Officer Richard Fuld.  \n Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008 with $639\nbillion in assets. It has said it will spend five years\nliquidating to pay unsecured creditors as little as 14.7 cents\non the dollar.  \n \u201cLehman\u2019s bankruptcy was the result of a series of\nunprecedented adverse events in the financial markets,\u201d Perkins\nsaid. \u201cIt was not caused by any accounting issues.\u201d  \n The case is In re Lehman Brothers Equity/Debt Securities\nLitigation, 08-cv-05523, U.S. District Court, Southern District\nof New York (Manhattan).  \n UralChem Sued for 3.1 Billion Rubles Over Contract  \n United Chemical Co. UralChem, seeking to raise as much as\n$642 million in a London initial public offering, is being sued\nfor 3.1 billion rubles ($106 million) over failing to buy agreed\nvolumes of raw materials.  \n OAO Apatit filed three suits against UralChem and unit OAO\nVoskresensk Mineral Fertilizers in Russian courts over supply\ncontracts for apatite concentrate in 2008 and 2009, Apatit\u2019s\nparent OAO Phosagro said in an e-mailed statement.  \n Moscow Arbitration Court spokesman Dmitry Tafintsev said\nthe court received a 1.7 billion-ruble lawsuit against UralChem\nand its unit and will decide within five days whether to review\nthe claim. Apatit filed two suits against Voskresensk April 23\nwith the Moscow Region Arbitration Court, a court spokesman\nsaid, declining to be identified in line with court policy.  \n OAO Silvinit, Russia\u2019s largest potash producer, also said\non its Web site that it filed a case in Moscow against UralChem\nand OAO Acron, claiming the two companies colluded on prices.  \n Moscow Arbitration Court registered a case involving the\ncompanies on April 21 and appointed a judge, said an official\nwho declined to be identified because of court policy.  \n UralChem hasn\u2019t received notification of the lawsuits by\nPhosAgro and Silvinit, and will defend its interests, the\ncompany said in an e-mailed statement April 23.

Goldman Sachs was sued April 16 by\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which claimed it\nmisled investors about collateralized debt obligations tied to\nsubprime mortgages in 2007.  \n \u201cIf it were a derivative suit against Goldman, defense\ncosts would be covered, and I\u2019d prefer not to be a primary on\nthe policy,\u201d said John Degnan, vice chairman and chief\noperating officer of AIG competitor  Chubb Corp ., while answering\na question about Goldman Sachs on an April 22 earnings call.  \n Goldman Sachs\u2019s board and top management were sued by\ninvestors in two separate cases. The investors, Morton Spiegel\nand Robert Rosinek, said in complaints filed April 22 in New\nYork State Supreme Court in Manhattan that Goldman Sachs\nofficers and directors breached their duty to the company by\npermitting it to enter into a series of collateralized debt\nobligations tied to subprime mortgages.  \n One of those CDOs is the subject of a lawsuit against the\nNew York-based firm by the SEC.  \n According to the derivative complaints, Blankfein and the\nother defendants failed to exercise oversight of the deals,\nexposing Goldman Sachs to billions of dollars in possible\nliability and damage to its reputation.  \n \u201cAs a result of the individual defendants\u2019 unlawful course\nof conduct and breaches of fiduciary duties, Goldman Sachs has\nsustained substantial economic losses, and has had its\nreputation in the business community and financial markets\nirreparably tarnished,\u201d the investors said in the complaints.  \n Mark Herr, an AIG spokesman, didn\u2019t return a call seeking\ncomment April 23. On April 20, he declined to comment on the\nGoldman Sachs policy. Goldman Sachs spokesman Ed Canaday\ndeclined to comment. The firm has said it will fight the SEC\ncase.  \n AIG is the lead insurer of the Goldman Sachs board against\nshareholder suits, according to a person with knowledge of the\npolicy. AIG may therefore have to pay the defense costs in the\nsuit in addition to any verdict or settlement.  \n The cases are Rosinek v. Blankfein, 650318-10, and Spiegel\nv.

In a March 22 letter to\nRajaratnam\u2019s lawyers, made public April 9, prosecutors said they\nhad an interest in his trading in Goldman Sachs stock in 2008.\nThree days before the letter was sent, Goldman Sachs announced\nGupta was leaving its board.  \n \u201cRajat has neither violated any law nor done anything else\nimproper,\u201d his attorney, Gary Naftalis of Kramer, Levin,\nNaftalis & Frankel LLP, said in a statement. \u201cHe has always\nconducted himself with integrity in his business, philanthropic\nand personal life.\u201d  \n Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson, SEC spokesman John\nNester and Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet\nBharara in New York, declined to comment.  \n Gupta hasn\u2019t been formally accused of any wrongdoing.  \n For more, click here.  \n Citigroup Wins Bid to Drop Suit Over Brokers\u2019 Signing Bonuses  \n   Citigroup Inc . won dismissal of a lawsuit by six former\nbrokers who said they shouldn\u2019t have to pay back the balance on\ntheir signing-bonus loans totaling $1.51 million.  \n U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in New York granted\nCitigroup\u2019s request in a ruling April 23.  \n \u201cHaving left the firm without repaying everything they\nowed, they brought this baseless lawsuit in what quite plainly\nwas a studied effort to prevent collection of the debts they\nowed through the arbitration process,\u201d Kaplan wrote.  \n Thomas Banus sued Citigroup in New York federal court in\nAugust. An amended complaint in October added five other former\nCitigroup brokers, who the bank said received signing bonuses\nranging from Banus\u2019s $45,675 to as much as $801,546. The\nplaintiffs sought class-action, or group, status on behalf of at\nleast 500 brokers employed by Citigroup in the previous six\nyears who executed promissory notes.  \n They asked the court to rule that they don\u2019t owe the money.\nNewly hired brokers are typically given loans, portions of which\nare forgiven annually for a number of years. If the broker\nleaves before the loan is completely forgiven, the remaining\nportion must be paid back with interest.  \n Banus called that requirement \u201cunconscionable\u201d in his\ncomplaint. He said he shouldn\u2019t have to pay all at once the\n$39,000 left on his forgivable signing-bonus loan when he quit\nin 2006.  \n \u201cWe are extremely disappointed with Judge Kaplan\u2019s\ndecision,\u201d the brokers\u2019 lawyer, Mark Thierman of Reno, Nevada,\nsaid in an e-mail.  \n The case is Banus v. Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 09-cv-\n07128, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York\n(Manhattan).  \n For more, click here.  \n BG, Eni Venture Face $2.5 Billion of Kazakh Claims  \n The Kazakh government is demanding at least $2.5 billion\nfrom an oil venture led by  BG Group Plc  and  Eni SpA  after talks\nstalled on the state\u2019s entry into the project, said two people\nwith knowledge of the matter.  \n The Central Asian state slapped the venture,  Karachaganak\nPetroleum Operating BV , with tax and environmental claims last\nyear, and sued for \u201cillegal earnings\u201d this year, after the\nproducer demanded $1.4 billion in tax rebates, said the people,\nwho declined to be identified before a settlement.  \n Kazakhstan is aiming to gain more revenue from resource\nprojects developed under production-sharing agreements, which\nallow investors to recoup costs before the government profits.\nKarachaganak is the only major Kazakh oil development without\nstate participation.  \n The dispute mirrors changes at the Kashagan project, the\ncountry\u2019s biggest oil development. In 2008, partners led by Eni\nagreed to pay higher royalties and cede shares to state-run\nKazMunaiGaz National Co. after the government condemned cost\noverruns and delays. The phase that runs from 2002 to 2014 may\ncost more than $38 billion.  \n \u201cInvestors are getting more and more concerned,\u201d said Ana\nJelenkovic, a London-based analyst at Eurasia Group, a political\nrisk consulting company. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be increasing noise\nfrom international companies but ultimately it\u2019s not that\nshocking anymore what the government is doing.\u201d  \n The Karachaganak partners want to understand the basis of\nthe Kazakh claims and resolve the dispute amicably, said a\nperson familiar with their plans, who declined to be identified\nbefore the issues are settled.  \n Francesca Ciardiello, a spokeswoman for Karachaganak\nPetroleum in Aksai, Kazakhstan, declined to comment on the\nfigures in an e-mailed response to questions, saying \u201cthere are\nvarious issues that are currently under negotiation or\ninvestigation.\u201d BG spokesman Neil Burrows referred questions to\nthe venture. Eni spokesman Filippo Cotalini declined to\nimmediately comment.  \n For more, click here.  \n CSR Wins Federal Court Appeal on Sugar Spinoff Plan  \n   CSR Ltd ., Australia\u2019s second-largest building products\nmaker, won court approval to spin off its sugar unit as it\nconsiders a A$1.75 billion ($1.6 billion) offer from China\u2019s\nBright Food Group Co.  \n The appeal judges considered that an \u201cerror\u201d was made in\nthe initial ruling that blocked the spinoff, according to a\ndecision handed down April 23 by the Full Federal Court in\nSydney.  \n The lower court ruled Feb. 3 that the spinoff and proposed\ncapital reduction would leave the company with less capital to\nmeet asbestos-related liabilities. CSR\u2019s mills produce 45\npercent of Australia\u2019s raw sugar and account for about 4 percent\nof the international trade.  \n \u201cWe welcome today\u2019s judgment,\u201d CSR spokesman Martin Cole\nsaid outside the court. \u201cWe had appealed on the basis that the\nfirst judgment contained errors in law and we welcome the\nclarification in today\u2019s judgment,\u201d he said.  \n CSR said April 1 it would enter talks with Shanghai-based\nBright Food on the offer, which was conditional on regulatory\napprovals and closer examination of the sugar division.  \n For more, click here.  \n For the latest lawsuits news, click here.  \n Legal Reviews  \n Citic Pacific Seeks Review of Materials Police Seized  \n   Citic Pacific Ltd . said it wants an independent counsel\nappointed to assess whether Hong Kong police, probing the\nbiggest currency derivatives loss by a Chinese company, had the\nright to seize certain materials.  \n \u201cCitic Pacific believes its legal advice is privileged and\nshould be returned,\u201d it said in an e-mailed statement April 23.\n\u201cMaterial that is irrelevant to search warrants, and thus\nshould not have been taken, should also be returned.\u201d  \n Police raided the head office of the Hong Kong-listed\ncompany on April 3, 2009, investigating whether the steelmaker\nand property developer had made false statements or conspired to\ndefraud. Citic Pacific was forced to seek aid from parent Citic\nGroup, which is backed by China\u2019s Cabinet, and Larry Yung\nresigned as chairman.  \n Richard Turnbull, a prosecutor with the Department of\nJustice, said April 23 Hong Kong investigators are still\nconducting their own determination of which seized materials\nmight be protected by legal privilege.  \n Citic Pacific said in its statement April 23 that the\nprinciple of privilege, the right to confidential legal advice,\nis protected by Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, or mini constitution. It\nhas asked the High Court for directions on how to proceed.  \n The company may be trying to avoid a court battle over what\nmaterials were protected, said Malcolm Kemp, Head of Litigation\nat Stephenson Harwood in Hong Kong.  \n \u201cThey may be trying to do this as cheaply and efficiently\nas possible,\u201d Kemp said.  \n For more, click here.  \n Trials/Appeals  \n Gome Founder\u2019s Bribery, Insider-Trading Trial Ends  \n Huang Guangyu\u2019s Beijing trial ended after a one-day hearing\nfor the insider-trading and bribery charges against the founder\nof Hong Kong-listed  Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd .  \n \u201cThe trial concluded yesterday,\u201d a female court clerk\nsurnamed He at the  Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People\u2019s Court \nsaid April 23.
