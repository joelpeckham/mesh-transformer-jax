 "context": "The following article called 'Norway Central Bank Delays Plans to Tighten Monetary Policy' was published on 2012-10-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNorges Bank pushed back plans to\ntighten  monetary policy  and said it probably won\u2019t start raising\ninterest rates until March at the earliest.  The bank, which had previously signaled rates may rise as\nearly as December, kept  its benchmark interest rate  at 1.5\npercent for a fourth meeting as policy makers struggle to\nbalance the risks posed by  Europe \u2019s debt crisis and an\noverheated domestic economy. Today\u2019s rate decision was forecast\nby all 14 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  \u201cThe key policy rate is being kept at a low level because\ninflation is low and global interest rates are at very low\nlevels,\u201d Norges Bank Governor Oeystein Olsen said in a\nstatement. \u201cGrowth among Norway\u2019s trading partners is weak and\nthe uncertainty surrounding developments in the international\neconomy is elevated.\u201d  Policy makers are keeping rates close to record lows\nfollowing two cuts over the past year after the krone\u2019s strength\nhurt exporters struggling to stay competitive. At the same time,\n Norway \u2019s Financial Supervisory Authority has warned that\nEurope\u2019s second-biggest oil exporter may be in the grip of a\nhousing bubble after low borrowing costs spurred credit growth\nand sent private debt loads to almost double average after-tax\nincomes.  October 2013  \u201cThe rate path that the bank has put forward shows a small\nprobability of a rate increase in the second quarter, with the\ngreatest likelihood of a rise in the third quarter,\u201d Ole Andre\nKjennerud, an economist at DNB Markets, said in an e-mailed\nnote. DNB expects the central bank to keep its main rate\nunchanged until October next year, after which gradual\ntightening will start, he said.  The krone, which gained as much as 0.7 percent against the\neuro earlier today, was trading 0.4 percent higher at 7.3948 per\nsingle currency unit as of 2:54 p.m. local time. Versus the\ndollar, the krone was up 0.7 percent at 5.6919, after trading as\nmuch as 1 percent higher earlier in the day.  The central bank\u2019s executive board decided that the policy\nrate should be in an interval of 1 percent to 2 percent through\nMarch next year, \u201cunless the Norwegian economy is exposed to\nmajor new shocks,\u201d the bank said. Policy makers didn\u2019t consider\ncutting rates today, Olsen told reporters after the decision was\nannounced.  Global Outlook  Weak global growth prospects have prompted central bankers\nin the  euro zone , the U.S. and  Japan  to resort to stimulus,\npushing rate increases further out in time. That\u2019s limited scope\nfor tightening in Norway, where Olsen has signaled he doesn\u2019t\nwant rates to stray too far from levels elsewhere.  \u201cDevelopments in the Norwegian economy give reason to\nbelieve that inflation will gradually pick up,\u201d Olsen said.\n\u201cThe analyses in this report suggest that the key policy rate\nshould be kept at today\u2019s level into next year, followed by a\ngradual increase towards a more normal level. The forecast for\nthe key policy rate in 2013 is slightly lower than the June\nforecast.\u201d  Gains in the krone, which hit a nine-year high against the\neuro in August, have kept  inflation  below the central bank\u2019s 2.5\npercent target since mid-2009. Annual underlying inflation,\nwhich adjusts for taxes, fees and energy prices, slowed to 1.1\npercent last month from 1.2 percent in August.  Currency Gains  The currency\u2019s appreciation has also raised the cost of\nNorwegian exports. Companies such as the world\u2019s second-biggest\nnewsprint maker  Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG)  and solar company\n Renewable Energy Corp. (REC)  ASA have cut jobs to stay competitive.  Meanwhile, the domestic economy continues to show signs of\noverheating.  House prices  rose an annual 7.3 percent in\nSeptember, the Norwegian Association of Real Estate Agents\nestimates.  Registered unemployment  fell below 2.5 percent last\nmonth as retail sales rose 0.7 percent in September from August,\nmore than economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted.\nHousehold credit growth was 7 percent last month, the statistics\nagency said today.  Norway\u2019s  mainland economy , which excludes oil, gas and\nshipping, will expand 3.7 percent this year as an oil sector\nboom filters through to the rest of the economy, boosting wages.\nThat compares with the European Commission\u2019s estimate for a 0.3\npercent contraction in the debt-laden euro area.  While Norges Bank is trying to balance policy to guide an\noil-driven expansion, in neighboring  Sweden , the Riksbank last\nmonth cut its benchmark to the lowest level since early 2011.  As Olsen responds to the threats facing Norway by leaving\nrates on hold, \u201cthe risk is apparent that Norway in the medium\nterm will develop precisely the domestic imbalances that the\nbank itself has warned against,\u201d  Carl Hammer , a currency\nstrategist at SEB, said in a note before the decision.
