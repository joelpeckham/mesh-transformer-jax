 "context": "The following article called 'VTB, Troika Shunning Lowest Ruble Yields May Mean Sale Bust: Russia Credit' was published on 2010-12-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRussia failed to sell any 2016 ruble\nbonds at an auction today and issued less than 1 percent of its\nthree-year notes after offering the lowest yields relative to\nmarket rates since it began providing guidance to investors\nthree months ago.  The Finance Ministry cancelled a sale of 6.42 billion\nrubles ($209 million) of so-called OFZs due 2016 after investors\ndemanded higher yields than the government was prepared to give,\naccording to a finance official who declined to be identified in\nline with ministry policy. The Ministry offered a yield of\nbetween 7.25 and 7.40 percent for the securities in guidance\nyesterday, at least 30 basis points below the yield of 7.7\npercent at the close of trading Dec. 13, data compiled by\nBloomberg show.  \u201cThey seem unwilling to borrow at where the market is now\nwhich means they likely won\u2019t succeed in the new placement,\u201d\nsaid  Nikolay Podguzov , the Moscow-based head of fixed-income\nstrategy at VTB Capital, the investment banking arm of Russia\u2019s\nlargest bank.  Russian yields are climbing on concern the fastest\ninflation rate in 11 months will lead the central bank to boost\nborrowing costs. Yields on Russia\u2019s 2016 OFZs were the highest\nsince the bonds were first issued in August after jumping a\nrecord 47 basis points, or 0.47 percentage point, on Dec. 13.  Russia is holding off on its first sale of ruble-\ndenominated bonds to investors abroad as the European debt\ncrisis weakens demand for emerging-market assets, Deputy Finance\nMinister Dmitry Pankin said in St. Petersburg last week. The\ngovernment will instead concentrate on building the domestic\nmarket, boosting ruble debt sales to 200 billion rubles in\nDecember, the biggest monthly target since September and more\nthan triple the amount initially planned, he said.  \u2018Small Premium\u2019  The increased bond sales won\u2019t \u201cforce down\u201d the price of\nOFZs, Pankin said last week. \u201cWe may give a small premium at\nauction, but no more than that,\u201d he said.  In its first auction today, the government sold just 0.7\npercent of 9.64 billion rubles of 2013 OFZs at a yield of 6.4\npercent, the top end of the ministry\u2019s guidance and 31 basis\npoints below market rates yesterday.  The Finance Ministry would need to offer yields up to 5\nbasis points above the market rate to attract bondholders,\n Alexander Morozov , chief economist for Russia and the former\nSoviet Union at HSBC Holdings Plc, said by phone in Moscow\nyesterday.  \u201cI fail to see the logic behind the Finance Ministry\u2019s\nguidance,\u201d  Alexander Ovchinnikov , vice-president for global\nmarkets at Troika Dialog in Moscow, Russia\u2019s oldest investment\nbank, said by e-mail yesterday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend buying\nthe OFZs, I don\u2019t see the potential for lower rates while the\nrisk of them rising further is there.\u201d  Budget Gap  The world\u2019s largest energy exporter is issuing debt to help\nplug a budget gap the government forecasts will be 4.6 percent\nthis year, only the second shortfall in 11 years. The government\nprojects the budget will remain in deficit until 2014, spurring\nborrowing. The increase in December OFZ sales is being prompted\nby government plans to make 20 percent of its annual expenditure\nin the last month of the year, Pankin said last week.  \u201cThe market is worried that the Finance Ministry said they\nplan to place 200 billion rubles, that\u2019s a lot for the last few\nweeks of the year,\u201d  Maxim Tishin , who helps manage $850 million\nof debt and equities at UFG Asset Management in Moscow, said by\ne-mail yesterday. \u201cTalk of rate hikes early next year\u201d is also\ndamaging demand for OFZs, he said.  Traders are pricing in 73 basis points of Russian rate\nincreases in the next three months, according to forward rate\nagreements tracked by Bloomberg.  Brazil has raised its benchmark rate, the Selic, three\ntimes since April 28 to 10.75 percent. The yield on the South\nAmerican nation\u2019s local-currency bonds due 2015 has climbed 58\nbasis points since it was issued in September.  Rates Rising  Speculation of higher interest rates helped the ruble rally\nthis month, bringing its advance against the greenback to 2.6\npercent. The ruble gained for a third day, adding 0.1 percent to\n30.6325 per dollar by 3:50 p.m. in Moscow. The currency, which\nis managed by the central bank against a dollar-euro basket to\nlimit swings that erode exporters\u2019 competitiveness, slid 2.2\npercent versus the dollar in November, its biggest monthly\ndecline since May.  Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to\nexpectations of currency movements and interest rate\ndifferentials and allow companies to hedge, showed the ruble\ntrading at 30.9056 per dollar in three months, the weakest this\nweek.  Extra Yield  Russia\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2020 rose, pushing the yield 2\nbasis points lower to 5.056 percent. The extra yield investors\ndemand to hold Russian debt rather than U.S. Treasuries rose 11\nbasis points to 201 today, according to JPMorgan EMBI+ indexes.\nThe difference compares with 130 for debt of similarly rated\nMexico and 161 for Brazil, which is rated two steps lower at\nBaa3 by Moody\u2019s.  The  yield   spread  on Russian bonds is 33 basis points below\nthe average for emerging markets, the widest since Nov. 22 yet\ndown from a 15-month high of 105 basis points in February,\naccording to JPMorgan.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for\nfive years using credit-default swaps is little changed at 142\ntoday, down from this year\u2019s peak of 217, according to data\nprovider CMA. The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange\nfor the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a\ngovernment or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Credit-default swaps for Russia, rated Baa1 by Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service, its third-lowest investment grade rating,\ncost 13 basis points more than contracts for Turkey, which is\nrated four levels lower at Ba2. Russia swaps  cost  as much as 40\nbasis points less on April 20.  \u2018Sit and Wait\u2019  The Finance Ministry doesn\u2019t need to raise all of the 200\nbillion rubles targeted as it can dip into its $40.9 billion\nReserve Fund, said  Dmitry Dudkin , the head of fixed-income\nresearch in Moscow at UralSib Financial Corp.  Officials \u201cdo not want to be moved by the recent sell-\noff,\u201d Dudkin said in e-mailed comments yesterday. \u201cThis may\nresult in the absence of demand, but it is unlikely that the\nFinance Ministry will be worried about it. It is wise for the\nministry to sit and wait a bit.\u201d  Annual inflation  rose for a fourth month in November to 8.1\npercent, the highest rate since December 2009. The pace may\nreach 8.4 percent this year, above the government\u2019s 8 percent\ntarget, Bank Rossii Chairman  Sergei Ignatiev  said Dec. 8.  Cutting Rates  After cutting key rates 14 times between April 2009 and May\nthis year to revive Russia in the wake of the global financial\ncrisis, the central bank may raise borrowing costs in the first\nquarter of next year as rising consumer prices are \u201cbeginning\nto worry us,\u201d Ignatiev said.  The central bank has a \u201cfree hand\u201d to start raising\nborrowing costs, First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said in\nMunich on Nov. 29. The next rates review will probably take\nplace on Dec. 24, according to Citigroup Inc.  Russia\u2019s main interest rates -- which include the record-\nlow 7.75 percent  refinancing rate , the 5 percent rate charged on\nrepurchase loans, and the 2.5 percent deposit rate -- are likely\nto be boosted in the first half of next year,  German Gref , chief\nexecutive officer of OAO Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest lender, told\nreporters in Moscow on Dec. 13.  \u201cThe sell-off in the OFZ market has been inspired by\nexpectations of key central bank rate increases in the short\nterm,\u201d VTB\u2019s Podguzov said.
