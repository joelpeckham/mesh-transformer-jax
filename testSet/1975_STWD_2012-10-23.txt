The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe developers of 701 Seventh Ave.\nin Manhattan\u2019s Times Square expect to have an agreement with a\nhotel company in the next 45 days that may pave the way for a\nnew tower, one of the site\u2019s owners said.  The owners want a \u201cW-type\u201d name for the site, said Steven Witkoff, referring to  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) \u2019s\nboutique brand. He spoke today at a midtown Manhattan conference\nsponsored by the law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP.  Witkoff and partners  Vector Group Ltd. (VGR)  and  Winthrop Realty\nTrust (FUR)  announced last week they had bought the property, located\non the northeast corner of Seventh Avenue and West 47th Street\nin one of New York\u2019s most popular tourist areas. They intend to\nbuild a 475-room, 220,000-square-foot (20,400-square-meter)\nhotel on the site, above an 8-story, 82,000-square-foot retail\nbase, Witkoff said.  \u201cIf we produce a hotel brand on top and get anywhere close\nto the leasing on this down below, the deal\u2019s a screamer,\u201d\nWitkoff said. \u201cWe\u2019ll look a lot smarter than we probably are.\u201d  Times Square hotels have averaged 86.4 percent occupancy\nthis year through September, according to data from Smith Travel\nResearch Inc. in Hendersonville,  Tennessee . That\u2019s up from 83.1\npercent a year earlier.  Witkoff didn\u2019t identify the name of the hotel operator the\ngroup is in negotiations with. The investor group paid $375\nmillion for 701 Seventh Ave., plus closing costs and other\nexpenses that brought the total to about $430 million, he said.\nBarry Sternlicht\u2019s  Starwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD)  and Starwood\nCapital Group LLC provided $475 million of debt to the partners.  The site also has rights to a 22,000-square-foot light-\nemitting diode sign that would be among the biggest in Times\nSquare, Witkoff said.  The property currently houses two office buildings, one of\nwhich was built in 1909. The larger building is covered almost\nentirely in advertising signs, mostly promoting Broadway shows.
