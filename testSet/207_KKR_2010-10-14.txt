 "context": "The following article called 'Yoplait Stake Is Said to Draw Interest From Grupo Lala, Mengniu' was published on 2010-10-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPAI Partners\u2019s planned sale of its\nstake in yogurt maker Yoplait is drawing interest from Mexico\u2019s\nGrupo Lala and  China Mengniu Dairy Co. , said people with\nknowledge of the matter.  KKR & Co. is considering whether to bid with China Mengniu,\nsaid the people, who declined to be identified because the sale\nprocess is private. BC Partners Ltd., Lion Capital LLP and AXA\nSA\u2019s private-equity arm are among the other buyout firms also\nweighing an offer.  General Mills Inc.  may also bid, they said.  Yoplait has grown to become the world\u2019s second-largest\nyogurt brand by distributing products through General Mills in\nthe U.S. and other partners around the world. PAI is considering\nselling its 50 percent stake in a deal that may value Yoplait at\nabout 1.2 billion euros ($1.69 billion), people involved in the\ntalks said in July.  PAI, which manages a 2.7 billion-euro buyout fund in Paris,\nand dairy cooperative Sodiaal hired banks including Morgan\nStanley and Societe Generale to manage the sale, said four\npeople with knowledge of the matter last month. Sodiaal, which\nfounded Yoplait and owns the other half of it, doesn\u2019t intend to\nsell its shares. PAI has owned its stake in the Boulogne-\nBillancourt, France-based company since 2002.  The sale process is in the early stages and it isn\u2019t clear\nwhether any potential acquirers have signed confidentiality\nagreements or formally expressed an interest.  Buyout Funds  Groupe Lactalis might be interested in Yoplait, said  Luc Morelon , a company spokesman, yesterday. Last month, Challenges\nmagazine reported KKR\u2019s interest, and the Sunday Times reported\nthat General Mills is considering an offer and Nestle SA may\nsubmit a bid.  Leveraged buyout fund managers such as BC Partners and\nLion, both based in London, have led $127 billion of purchases\nin 2010, more than double the amount in the year-earlier period,\nas they seek to return profit to investors and persuade them to\ncommit money to new funds.  Mengniu spokeswoman  Zhao Yuanhua  and a spokesman for Grupo\nLala declined to immediately comment. Officials at AXA, General\nMills, Lion, BC Partners, KKR, and Nestle declined to comment.  Jacques Caillaud, a spokesman for Sodiaal, declined to\ncomment. A spokesman for PAI didn\u2019t return calls.
