 "context": "The following article called 'Boar Hunter Sets Sights on China After MF Global: Commodities' was published on 2012-03-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPete Nessler has bagged everything\nfrom a wild boar to a 280-pound white-tailed deer hunting in\n Iowa . He\u2019s now aiming to tap  China \u2019s need for raw materials.  INTL FCStone Inc., where the 54-year-old Midwesterner is\npresident of the commodity unit, will hedge part of the $6.7\nbillion of soybeans that Chinese customers agreed to buy during\nVice President  Xi Jinping \u2019s visit to the U.S. last month, which\nincluded a stop in Des Moines. The New York-based company wants\nto expand the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s share of  revenue  fivefold\nfrom 4.4 percent now, Nessler said, visiting his office on the\n52nd floor of a skyscraper overlooking the Strait of Singapore.  \u201cWe\u2019ve made this part of the region an integral part of\nour thought process and expansion,\u201d said Nessler, whose home is\ndecorated with the heads of 18 animals from antelope to rams.\n\u201cWhen you had the Chinese vice president going from  Washington \nand bypassed everywhere else and ended up in Iowa, that made\npeople in Iowa feel very good as it\u2019s a big part of the\nagricultural trade with China.\u201d  At stake are the fees that come from serving China, the\nbiggest consumer of everything from soybeans to pork to cotton\nand the  buyer  of $20 billion of U.S. farm goods last year. The\n U.S. Department of Agriculture  is leading what Secretary Tom Vilsack is calling its biggest-ever trade mission to the nation\nlater this month, seeking to bolster the record $136.3 billion\nof agricultural exports made worldwide in 2011.  Soybean Contracts  INTL FCStone hosted about 40 people from the Chinese\ndelegation during a dinner given by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad\non Feb. 15. The 650 attendees were served a  menu  that included\nbacon, lettuce and tomato canapes, bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin\nand apple pie cupcakes with maple-syrup frosting.  Three of the Chinese firms in the delegation, existing\ncustomers of FCStone, were among those signing the soybean\nagreements reached in Iowa, Nessler said. The company is\nadvising them on how to hedge prices and manage risk from when\nthe soybeans are bought to their delivery in China, as well as\ncontrolling freight costs. That includes the use of futures and\noptions traded in Chicago and on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  For INTL FCStone, China is an opportunity to diversify its\nbusiness beyond  North America , which represents 73 percent of\nrevenue. The company had already expanded in  Europe  before\nbuying the London Metal Exchange unit of MF Global Holdings\nLtd., the broker-dealer that filed for bankruptcy, in November.\nTraded on  Nasdaq , where its market capitalization is $420\nmillion, INTL FCStone handled $75 billion of physical trade in\noilseeds, grains, cattle and metals last year, data on its\nwebsite show.  Wen Jiabao  The drive to win more business in China comes amid slowing\nexpansion in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy after the U.S.\nPremier  Wen Jiabao  lowered the annual  growth  goal to 7.5 percent\nin a state-of-the-nation speech March 5. While that\u2019s the lowest\nsince 2004, it\u2019s a sign the ruling Communist Party wants to\nshift growth toward consumption and away from exports.  China\u2019s  population  of 1.34 billion will consume 27 percent\nof the world\u2019s soybeans this year, 22 percent of its corn and 50\npercent of its pork, USDA estimates show. Growth of 7.5 percent\nwould still be more than twice the 3.3 percent anticipated for\nthe global economy this year by the International Monetary  Fund (IGDYWRLD) .\nSoybean futures have climbed 9.9 percent this year in  Chicago ,\nand corn is down 1.2 percent.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good time for companies to push into China,\u201d said\nNicholas Zhu, head of macro-commodity research for  Asia  at\nAustralia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Shanghai . \u201cHaving\na trading unit that can access futures exchanges here is not to\ncapture the latest pessimistic turn of things, but rather an\ninvestment for the next phase.\u201d  Shanghai Futures  INTL FCStone opened its fourth Asia-Pacific office in\nShanghai last year, trading physical metals as well as\nagricultural futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. The\ncompany may also get access to the Shanghai Futures Exchange\nthis year, Nessler said. The bourse is the nation\u2019s second-\nlargest after Zhengzhou, China Futures Association data show.  The firm, which traces its origins to an egg-selling\nventure founded in Chicago in 1924, is expanding at a time when\nZurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG,  Switzerland \u2019s second-\nlargest bank, and Natixis SA, the investment-banking and asset-\nmanagement unit of Paris-based Groupe BPCE, plan to cut their\ncommodity businesses.  Archer Daniels Midland Co. (ADM) , the world\u2019s largest grain\nprocessor, said Feb. 21 it would cut 1,200 jobs as the Decatur,\nIllinois-based company reduces costs. Cargill Inc., a\nMinneapolis-based grain trader and the largest closely held U.S.\ncompany, said in December it would eliminate 2,000 positions.  West Des Moines  Nessler, based in  West Des Moines  for three decades, became\npresident of FCStone LLC in October 2010 and oversaw four\nacquisitions since then. MF Global\u2019s LME unit, comprising 55\npeople, was bought for an undisclosed amount and came with a\nseat on the trading floor of the world\u2019s biggest metals bourse,\nalongside JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc and nine others.  INTL FCStone posted a loss of $2.4 million on a marked-to-\nmarket basis in the three months ended Dec. 31, the first\nquarterly loss since 2008. The company prefers that measure\nrather than generally accepted accounting principles partly\nbecause it reflects changes in the value of commitments to\nfuture commodity transactions. Its shares fell 6.8 percent this\nyear and were little changed in 2011.  The company has more than 20,000 clients across 100\ncountries, and trades solely on their behalf, said Nessler. The\nnumber of customers has doubled in two years as the workforce\nrose 70 percent to more than 1,000, he said. INTL FCStone may\nadd rubber trading if it can find the right team, Nessler said.  \u2018Millions and Millions\u2019  Among his first clients was Brad Davis, chief executive\nofficer of Gold-Eagle Cooperative, a firm based in Goldfield,\nIowa, that trades as much as 40 million bushels of corn and\nsoybeans a year and operates an ethanol plant with annual output\nof 60 million gallons.  \u201cYou always know where he stands,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTrust is\nvery important in this business. Millions and millions of\ndollars of business that\u2019s conducted verbally, at least\ninitially, so you need to have tremendous trust in the\nindividuals and the  company  you are doing your business with.\u201d  Nessler also oversaw the acquisition of Hencorp Becstone\nFutures LC, London-based Ambrian Commodities Ltd., and\nCoffeeNetwork, a news and analysis website. INTL FCStone said in\nDecember that it was in negotiations to buy London-based TRX\nFutures Ltd. About 65 percent of the group\u2019s revenue comes from\ncommodities. Other areas include foreign exchange and equities.  The Midwesterner\u2019s parents were from Yugoslavia and  Romania \nand came to live in Chicago during World War II. He gained a\ndegree in agricultural industries from the  University of\nIllinois  before trading soybeans at AGRI Industries in West  Des\nMoines . He also has a 250-acre non-commercial farm growing corn\nand soybeans.  \u201cAgriculture back then wasn\u2019t a very sexy world to get\ninto,\u201d Nessler said. \u201cI am lucky enough to have the foresight\nto realize that at the end of the day, there\u2019s a certain thing\nthat people couldn\u2019t live without, and that\u2019s food.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nChanyaporn Chanjaroen in Singapore at \n cchanjaroen@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJames Poole at \n jpoole4@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 29.886396408081055 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
