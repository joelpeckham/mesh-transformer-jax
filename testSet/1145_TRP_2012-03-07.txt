 "context": "The following article called 'Obama to Propose Tax Credits for Alternative Fuel Vehicles' was published on 2012-03-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPresident  Barack Obama  proposed\nexpanded tax credits and community research grants to make\nalternative-energy cars and trucks more attractive to buyers, as\nhe pitched his energy agenda in the battleground state of  North\nCarolina .  Electric, natural gas and hydrogen-powered vehicles would\nbe covered by the plan, which Obama said is part of his strategy\nto buffer the U.S. against rising oil costs.  \u201cBoth you and I know there are no quick fixes to this\nproblem,\u201d Obama told his audience at a Daimler Trucks North\nAmerica plant in Mount Holly, North Carolina. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to\ncontinually develop new sources of energy.\u201d  Obama has been focusing on energy in public appearances and\nspeeches over the past two weeks as rising gasoline prices\nthreaten to impede the recovery and the issue is being raised by\nthe Republicans seeking to run against him in November.  The  average retail price  for a gallon of regular gasoline\nwas $3.76 as of yesterday, according to the American Automobile\nAssociation. That\u2019s up from $3.51 a year ago. The increase has\nbeen a sour note among positive economic news as data from\nhomebuilding to car sales to jobless claims have beat forecasts.  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to just drill our way out\u201d of\nhigher energy costs, Obama said, repeating a message he\u2019s been\ndelivering to counter Republican criticism of his policies.  Factory Tour  Before speaking, Obama toured the factory, which has begun\nhiring more than 500 workers to meet demand for heavy-duty\ntrucks, a sign of economic recovery. The plant, near  Charlotte ,\nmakes Freightliner heavy-duty trucks as well as hybrid and\nnatural gas trucks.  Daimler Trucks North America, a unit of  Daimler AG (DAI) , is a\npartner in an Energy Department program focused on increasing\nthe fuel efficiency of long haul, 18-wheel trucks by 50 percent\nby 2015. Those trucks, about 4 percent of the on-road vehicles\nin the U.S., account for almost 20 percent of the nation\u2019s fuel\nconsumption, according to the White House.  Obama is asking Congress to make two changes in tax law to\ncoax drivers into less-polluting vehicles. One would raise the\ntax credit to $10,000 from $7,500 for the purchase of a so-\ncalled advanced vehicle. The credit would be applied instantly\nat the dealership, according to a White House fact sheet.  Commercial Trucks  The second tax change would target buyers of electric and\nnatural gas powered commercial trucks, including semi-tractor\ntrailers. Those vehicles would qualify for a 50 percent tax\ncredit for half the additional cost over a conventional truck,\nto help overcome the initial upfront cost.  Obama also offered a new, $1 billion program to as many as\n15 U.S. cities to finance investments in clean-vehicle\ninfrastructure, such as charging stations, which would require\ncongressional approval. The administration is highlighting an\nexisting research program on how to cut the cost of electric\nvehicles and increase their range. Action by lawmakers isn\u2019t\nrequired, though the administration is asking for an additional\n$650 million for the year that begins Oct. 1.  Obama\u2019s $1 billion plan for clean-vehicle infrastructure\nfollows a General Motors Co. announcement that it was halting\nproduction of the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid for five weeks\nbecause sales haven\u2019t met goals.  Republican Criticism  Republicans have accused Obama of wasting tax money on\nalternative energy programs.  \u201cThe president likes to talk about fairness,\u201d Senate\nRepublican Leader  Mitch McConnell  said in a Senate speech today.\n\u201cThe American people don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly fair that at\na time when they\u2019re struggling to fill up the tank, their own\ntax dollars are being used to subsidize failing solar companies\nof the president\u2019s choosing.\u201d  McConnell said Obama \u201ccan\u2019t claim\u201d to have a\ncomprehensive  energy policy  \u201cand any time he says he does, the\nAmerican people should remember one word: Keystone,\u201d a\nreference to the administration\u2019s decision to delay a permit for\n TransCanada Corp. (TRP) \u2019s oil pipeline.  Obama won North Carolina in 2008 by 0.3 percent, or 14,177\nvotes, the first Democrat to capture the Tar Heel state since\n Jimmy Carter  in 1976. North Carolina is also tied with  Florida \nas having the fifth highest  unemployment rate  at 9.9 percent in\nDecember, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Only\n Nevada ,  California ,  Rhode Island  and  Mississippi  are worse.  \u2018Bad\u2019 Numbers  \u201cWe\u2019ve had a real hit\u201d said Andy Taylor, a political\nscience professor at  North Carolina State University  in Raleigh.\n\u201cThose headline numbers have been bad and haven\u2019t helped the\nadministration.\u201d  The manufacturing sector, which accounts for one of five\njobs in the state, suffered during the recession, with job\nlosses in transportation, food and textiles among others. The\nstate has lost about 110,000 jobs since Obama took office,\ngovernment figures show.  Obama\u2019s visit to North Carolina, the 13th of his\npresidency, follows an appearance by first Lady Michele Obama on\nMarch 2. By the end of last week, the campaign had opened\noffices in Winston-Salem and Asheville, bringing to nine the\ntotal in the state, The News & Observer reported.  \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to getting a lot of attention,\u201d\nTaylor said. \u201cThe race will be very, very close.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nRoger Runningen in Washington at \n rrunningen@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSteven Komarow at \n skomarow1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of TransCanada Corporation was 27.807783126831055 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of TransCanada Corporation was ",
