 "context": "The following article called 'Old Mutual\u2019s Nedbank Says Profit Rises 27% on Boost in Loans' was published on 2012-08-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South African\nbank controlled by insurer  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , said first-half\nprofit rose 27 percent after consumers borrowed more.  Net income climbed to 3.49 billion rand ($422 million) from\n2.76 billion rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based lender\nsaid in a statement today. The bank extended 69 billion rand of\nnew loans to customers in the period, helping to increase net\ninterest income by 11 percent to 9.64 billion rand.  Nedbank, South Africa\u2019s fourth-largest lender by assets,\nhas been boosting lending to consumers to win a bigger share of\nSouth Africa\u2019s consumer market from rivals such as  Standard Bank\nGroup Ltd. (SBK)  and Barclays Plc\u2019s  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  The company added\n76 outlets, 385 ATMs and developed software for smart-phones in\nthe period to lure more customers.  \u201cNedbank has been growing in high-margin areas like\npersonal loans and cards, but not in problem areas like\ncommercial property finance or home loans, so it\u2019s doing the\nright thing,\u201d Patrice Rassou, who helps oversee about $41\nbillion as head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management in\n Cape Town , said today.  The company raised its half-year dividend 28 percent to 340\ncents. The stock rose 0.3 percent higher to 181.18 rand in\nJohannesburg. Nedbank is the third-best performing stock on the\nsix-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index (JBNKS)  this year after rising\nalmost 25 percent.  Mortgage Lending  The results were \u201cunderpinned by good revenue growth,\nprudent provisioning, responsible expense management and\nincreased capital and liquidity ratios,\u201d Chief Executive\nOfficer  Mike Brown  said in the statement. Percentage growth in\nlending should be in the \u201cmid-single digits\u201d in the second\nhalf, he said.  The bank increased the amount of money it sets aside for\nmortgages that sour to 29.5 percent of total home loans, up from\n28 percent. Absa, which experienced a 39 percent jump in bad\ndebts in the first half, increased its so-called coverage ratio\nto 22.6 percent last week.  Nedbank may lose market share in mortgage lending by\nfocusing on existing customers rather than taking on unknown\nclients, Brown said in a telephone interview today.  \u201cWe have tailored our risk appetite on different\nproducts,\u201d he said, adding that the bank may also lose some\nshare of the unsecured loans market because it doesn\u2019t want to\nincrease the size and duration of the personal loans it grants.  South Africa \u2019s 50 basis point  interest-rate cut  last month\nwill cost the lender 160 million rand after tax in the second\nhalf, Brown said. Nedbank\u2019s expenses and the number of bad debts\nshould continue to fall in that period, he said. Lending is\nlikely to increase and profit margins may widen, he added.
