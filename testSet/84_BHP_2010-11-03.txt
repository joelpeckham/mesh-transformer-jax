 "context": "The following article called 'Saskatchewan to Sue Canada If BHP's Potash Bid Is Approved' was published on 2010-11-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSaskatchewan is poised to sue the\nfederal government if Canada approves  BHP Billiton Ltd. \u2019s $40\nbillion hostile takeover offer for  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan\nInc. , Premier  Brad Wall  said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve made a well-rounded, compelling case that the\nanswer in this takeover bid from Investment Canada should be\n\u2018no,\u2019 and that the wishes of the province should be respected,\u201d\nWall told reporters yesterday in Regina, the provincial capital.\n\u201cIf we are going to make a legal challenge, it will have to\nhappen quickly, and it will.\u201d  Canadian Industry Minister  Tony Clement  plans to say today\nwhether Canada will allow the deal to proceed after markets\nclose at 4 p.m. New York time, a person familiar with the\nannouncement said. Saskatchewan has said the takeover of Potash\nCorp. by Melbourne-based BHP would cut provincial tax revenue by\nC$3 billion ($2.97 billion) over 10 years, lead to fewer jobs\nand forfeit Canadian control of a \u201cstrategic\u201d resource.  Wall said the Canadian government should reimburse the\nprovince for revenue lost if it approves BHP\u2019s bid.  \u201cIf they want to make this deal, then they can indemnify\nthe province of Saskatchewan against the costs,\u201d Wall said.\n\u201cIt will be Ottawa\u2019s deal, not Saskatchewan\u2019s deal, and the\npeople of Saskatchewan will not be on the hook for it.\u201d  While Potash Corp., based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, has\nrejected BHP\u2019s $130-a-share offer as too low, the proposed\ntransaction has stirred debate across Canada over the sale of\nsome of the country\u2019s largest natural-resources companies to\nforeign buyers.  Resource-Company Acquisitions  In 2006, Switzerland\u2019s Xstrata Plc made a successful bid\nfor nickel producer Falconbridge Ltd., while Brazil\u2019s Vale SA\nagreed to buy miner Inco Ltd. In addition, Rio Tinto Group,\nbased in London, bought aluminum producer Alcan Inc. in 2007.  Russia asked local fertilizer makers to consider a joint\nbid to counter BHP, according to OAO Acron, the nation\u2019s third-\nlargest producer of nitrogen soil nutrients. Acron told the\ngovernment it wouldn\u2019t join the plan after receiving a letter\nfrom the Industry and Trade Ministry on Nov. 1 proposing a\ncombined bid, Chairman  Alexander Popov  said today by telephone\nin Moscow. Artur Gimatdinov, a ministry spokesman, wasn\u2019t\nimmediately able to comment when contacted by Bloomberg.  If BHP\u2019s acquisition of Potash Corp. is approved by Clement\nand the transaction proceeds, the deal would be the largest\ntakeover of a Canadian company since Vivendi SA\u2019s $46.1 billion\npurchase of distiller Seagram Co. in 2000.  \u2018Massive Transfer\u2019  The BHP-Potash deal represents \u201ca massive transfer of\ncontrol outside of Canada,\u201d  Ralph Goodale , a Saskatchewan\nlawmaker and deputy leader of the opposition Liberal Party, told\nreporters in Ottawa yesterday. \u201cI think Saskatchewan has an\nimportant case to test in the courts.\u201d  Potash Corp. rose 52 cents to $145.50 at 4:15 p.m. in New\nYork Stock Exchange composite trading, 12 percent more than\nBHP\u2019s bid.  BHP  climbed 3 pence to 2,280 pence in London.  \u201cThe political side is always difficult, because they come\nfrom a different agenda, but that\u2019s the wild card,\u201d said  Greg Eckel , who helps manage C$900 million at Morgan Meighen &\nAssociates Ltd. in Toronto. \u201cI\u2019m sort of a split personality on\nthis. I\u2019d love to see it taken out for a quick gain, but I\nwouldn\u2019t know what to replace it with as a longer-term\ninvestment.\u201d  Case Under Review  Buying Potash Corp. would give BHP, the world\u2019s largest\nmining company, its first production of fertilizer, allowing it\nto benefit from the projected increase in demand as an expanding\nglobal population consumes more food.  BHP has said it would make Saskatchewan home to its\nheadquarters for potash operations, continue developing its C$12\nbillion Jansen potash mining project in the province, maintain\ncurrent employment levels and propose a Canadian nominee for\nelection to its board.  Under the  Investment Canada Act , the federal government can\nblock any transaction valued at C$299 million or more if it\nfinds the deal doesn\u2019t provide a \u201cnet benefit\u201d to the country.\nClement said as of yesterday he hadn\u2019t made a decision on the\nbid.  \u201cI am currently reviewing the facts of the case,\u201d he said\nin an e-mailed statement. \u201cAs of yet no decision has been made,\nand no decision or recommendation has been communicated to the\ninvestor.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Christopher Donville  in Vancouver at \n cjdonville@bloomberg.net .
