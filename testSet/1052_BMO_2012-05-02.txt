 "context": "The following article called 'Canadian Dollar Gains Versus Euro on Divergent Economies' was published on 2012-05-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanada \u2019s dollar strengthened for a\nsecond day versus the euro after manufacturing in the 17-nation\nregion shrank for a ninth month, signaling the region\u2019s economic\nmalaise is deepening.  The Canadian currency advanced 0.5 percent during the past\nmonth, third-most among 10 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg\nCorrelation-Weighted Indexes, on speculation the North American\neconomy will fare better than other developed regions. Bank of\nCanada Governor  Mark Carney  reiterated yesterday that higher\ninterest rates \u201cmay become appropriate\u201d as growth firms.  \u201cCarney is certainly an island now; he\u2019s the last of the\nhawks,\u201d  Dean Popplewell , chief strategist in Toronto at the\nonline currency-trading firm Oanda Corp., said in an interview\nat Bloomberg headquarters in  New York . \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly see a\nhike by the beginning of next year.\u201d  Canada\u2019s currency, nicknamed the loonie, rose 0.5 percent\nto C$1.2979 per euro at 5 p.m. in Toronto, touching the\nstrongest since April 18. It was little changed at 98.63 cents\nper  U.S. dollar . One Canadian dollar buys $1.0139.  The currency has strengthened 1.4 percent this year against\nthe Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The U.S.\ndollar is off 2.4 percent and the yen is down 6.8 percent.  Bonds Rise  Government bonds  rose, pushing the two-year  yield  down two\nbasis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.31 percent, the\nthird straight decline, as the price of the 0.75 percent\nsecurities due May 2014 increased three cents to C$98.92.  Canadian two-year bonds yielded 1.05 percentage points more\nthan equivalent-maturity U.S. Treasuries, the least since April\n16, the day before Bank of Canada policy makers suggested\n interest rates  may be rising as domestic economic growth and\ninflation exceeds forecasts.  Canada sold C$2.6 billion ($2.6 billion) of 10-year bonds.\nThe 2.75 percent securities due in June 2022 drew an average\nyield of 2.096 percent, with a bid to cover ratio -- the amount\nbid relative to the amount on offer --of 2.5 times, according to\nthe central bank\u2019s website. The previous auction of 10-year\nbonds, on Feb. 1, drew an average yield of 2.015 percent and a\ncoverage ratio of 2.31 times.  A manufacturing gauge in the euro region fell to 45.9 in\nApril, a 34-month low, from 47.7 in March,  Markit Economics  said\ntoday. Readings below 50 indicate contraction. The report also\nindicated that job losses at factories increased and there was\n\u201cweak\u201d demand from both domestic and export customers.  Economic Data  \u201cThe markets are reacting to the PMI numbers that were a\ndisappointment across the board,\u201d said  Jack Spitz , managing\ndirector of foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada (NA)  in\nToronto, in a telephone interview, referring to the European\nmanufacturing data. \u201cThe Canadian dollar will be influenced by\nthe broader sense of global risk, and by global and U.S.\neconomic data,\u201d  The loonie lost as much as 0.5 percent against the\ngreenback earlier after figures from Roseland, New Jersey-based\nADP Employer Services showed U.S. companies added 119,000\nworkers in April, the fewest in seven months. The median\nforecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a\n170,000 advance.  \u201cThe weaker-than-expected ADP report sparked a modest\nretreat for the Canadian dollar,\u201d said Blake Jespersen,\ndirector of foreign exchange in Toronto at Bank of Montreal\u2019s\nBMO Capital Markets unit, in an e-mail. \u201cThe bias now is for a\nweaker Canadian dollar tomorrow on expectations of a lower non-\nfarm payroll number.\u201d  Canada ships about three quarters of its  exports  to the\nU.S., the world\u2019s largest economy.  Jobs Numbers  U.S. employers added 160,000 workers to payrolls in April,\nbased on the median of 80 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. The\nLabor Department is due to release the report on May 4.  \u201cThe Canadian dollar is going to be influenced by Friday\u2019s\npayroll number,\u201d said National Bank\u2019s Spitz. \u201cFunds continue\nto be supported above 98 cents and offered below parity,\u201d he\nsaid, referring to the U.S.-Canada exchange rate.  The loonie, which traded as low as C$1.0319 in January,\nwill weaken to parity with its U.S. counterpart by the end of\nJune before strengthening to 98 cents at year-end, according to\nthe median of 40 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.
