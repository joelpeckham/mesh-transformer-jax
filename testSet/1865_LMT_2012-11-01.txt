The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMilitary spending cuts among\ndeveloped countries and changes in export markets will force\ndefense companies to restructure, U.K. Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said.  \u201cI have no doubt the reorganization of the defense\nindustries across the developed world will be required over the\ncoming years,\u201d he said at the  Royal United Services Institute \u2019s\nannual air-power conference in London today. \u201cThere are a\nnumber of permutations that are possible,\u201d he said, without\noutlining details.  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and  European Aerospace, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) \nexplored merging into the world\u2019s largest aerospace and defense\ncompany by sales, in part to broaden  market access  in the face\nof lower spending prospects in Europe. The plan unraveled amid\ngovernment opposition to the deal.  \u201cThe merger shows just how significant the national-\ninterest barriers are that have to be overcome,\u201d Hammond said.\nThat is true even if the German concerns were over jobs rather\nthan defense considerations, he said.  Changes being made within the defense ministry should help\ncompanies generate overseas sales, such as building in\n\u201cexportability\u201d into programs as they are defined, Hammond\nsaid. Having a strong  aerospace industry  is \u201cvital,\u201d he said.  The defense ministry will publish more details of its\nequipment plan in the coming months, Hammond said. \u201cThis will\nprovide greater granularity than ever before about how money\nwill be spent across the breadth of capabilities by breaking\ndown spending for equipment and support.\u201d  Balanced Budget  Prime Minister  David Cameron \u2019s government says it has\nclosed a shortfall in the  defense budget  inherited from the\nprevious Labour administration and the National Audit Office is\ndue to make an assessment by year-end.  Budget concerns persist, though, with submarine plans set\nto create a cash spending increase after 2020 that needs to be\ndealt with to avoid derailing other equipment projects.  The U.K. is still debating whether to use both aircraft\ncarriers now under construction. The cost of operating a second\ncarrier would be 70 million pounds ($113 million) per year,\nHammond said. \u201cI think that\u2019s an extremely good investment,\u201d\nhe said, while noting a decision on whether to proceed with\ndeploying both will be made in 2015 at the next strategic\nreview.  The U.K. will put one carrier into operation starting in\n2018 with around 12  Lockheed Martin (LMT)  F-35B Joint Strike Fighters.\nThat figure could be increased if necessary, Hammond said.
