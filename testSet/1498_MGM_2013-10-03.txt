 "context": "The following article called 'Farney Daniels, Time Warner: Intellectual Property' was published on 2013-10-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA cease-and-desist letter by\n Nebraska \u2019s attorney general to a law firm representing a patent\nowner isn\u2019t enforceable, a federal judge in Omaha ruled.  In a July 18 letter to Georgetown, Texas-based  Farney\nDaniels LLP , the state\u2019s Attorney General Jon Bruning said the\nfirm is making infringement assertions that \u201care\nunsubstantiated and contain false, misleading or deceptive\nstatements.\u201d  Its actions may violate the Nebraska Consumer Protection\nAct, Bruning said, demanding that Farney Daniels \u201cimmediately\ncease and desist the initiation of any and all new patent\ninfringement enforcement efforts within the state.\u201d  Bruning accused Farney Daniels\u2019s client, Activision TV\nInc., of being a \u201cpatent troll,\u201d a pejorative term for a\npatent owner who doesn\u2019t make goods or provide services covered\nby the patents it seeks to enforce.  Farney Daniels said in response that while Bruning \u201cmay\nhave concerns about the U.S. patent system and how it works or\nparticular types of patent owners,\u201d the firm had lawfully\nrepresented its clients in upholding their rights, according to\ncourt papers.  Bruning\u2019s actions \u201cshould be of concern to every firm in\nthe country that works to protect and enforce the lawful rights\nof U.S. patent owners,\u201d Farney Daniels said.  The firm then asked the court to determine whether it could\nrepresent Activision without running afoul of the cease-and-desist order and if the court had the jurisdiction to determine\nthe constitutionality of the cease-and-desist order.  The underlying suit was filed July 12. Naples, Florida-based Activision had claimed that Pinnacle Bancorp Inc., of\nCentral City, Nebraska, infringed two patents relating to a\nremote control display system.  In dispute are patents 8,330,613, and 7,369,058. \nActivision filed suits in other judicial districts claiming \nadditional defendants also infringed the two patents.  In his Sept. 30 ruling, U.S. District Judge Joseph F.\nBataillon said that Activision\u2019s right to hire counsel of its\nown choosing \u201cis clearly impeded by the cease-and-desist\norder.\u201d He also said that allowing the attorney general to\ninterfere in the case might be \u201charmful to the patent\nprocess.\u201d  Bruning would be free to return to court to seek a lifting\nof the court order if the evidence supports a finding that the\nsuit was filed in bad faith, the judge said.  Bruning said in an Oct. 1  statement  that nothing in the\ncourt order stops \u201cour ongoing investigation into patent trolls\nand law firms that represent them, specifically Farney\nDaniels.\u201d  Among the companies Activision sued over the two patents\nare  Pernod Ricard SA (RI) \u2019s Dunkin Donuts unit,  Cinemark Holdings\nInc. (CNK) ,  MGM Resorts International Inc. (MGM) ,  Cianbro Corp., Tedeschi\nFood Shops Inc., and  Harley Davidson Inc. (HOG) , according to\nBloomberg data.  The case is Activision TV Inc., v. Pinnacle Bancorp Inc.,\n8:13-cv-00215-JFB-TDT, U.S. District Court, District of Nebraska\n(Omaha).  For more patent news, click here.

South Africa\u2019s Proposed IP Policy Said to Be \u2018Incoherent\u2019  The South African government\u2019s draft policy on  intellectual\nproperty  issues was called \u201can incoherent stream of\nconsciousness\u201d by the intellectual property law department of\nStellenbosch University,  South Africa \u2019s Business Day  reported .

Boston Court Enters Default Judgment Against Adult-Film Company  In an adult-film copyright case, a federal judge in  Boston \nallowed a default judgment against the film company.  AF Holdings LLC sued Sandipan Chowdhury in November 2012,\naccusing him of using the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol to\ndownload the film \u201cSexual Obsession.\u201d  Chowdhury responded by saying the law firm that filed the\nsuit represented a \u201cstraw plaintiff\u201d with no standing to\npursue the case. Additionally, Chowdhury said that the IP\naddress of the entity that distributed \u201cSexual Obsession\u201d\nindicated that the law firm representing the film maker may\nactually have put the film out on the Internet for others to\ndownload.  He said in his pleadings that the firm \u201crepresents an\nentire in-house copyright trolling monopoly, not designed to\npromote works for distribution and sale, but to allege\ninfringement and reap profits from the threat of litigation.\u201d  Chowdhury asked the court to order the film company to post\na $60,000 bond so that he could recover damages, attorney fees\nand litigation costs if he prevailed in the litigation.  On June 19 the court ordered the company to post the bond,\nwhich it failed to do. Chowdhury then requested that the court\nenter a default judgment, which was allowed by U.S. District\nJudge Joseph L. Tauro on Sept. 30.  The case is AF Holdings LLC v. Sandipan Chowdhury, 1:13-cv-12105-JLT, U.S. District Court, District of  Massachusetts .  For more copyright news, click here.
