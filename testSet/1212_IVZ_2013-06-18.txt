 "context": "The following article called 'Tissue Regenix Licenses Technology to U.S. Tissue Bank' was published on 2013-06-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTissue Regenix Group Plc (TRX) , a U.K.\nmaker of replacement body parts, agreed to license its cell-removal technology to a U.S. tissue bank that will produce a\nhuman-skin replacement for sale next year.  Tissue Regenix will pay  Community Tissue Services  of\nDayton,  Ohio , a processing fee for decellularized skin that the\ntissue bank produces with the company\u2019s dCell technology,\nmanaging director Antony Odell said.  The agreement gives the York, England-based company a\nsupply of tissue to make the product, which it can then sell in\nthe U.S. and in other countries. U.S. laws prohibit the non-profit bank, which handles 10 percent of tissue grafts in the\nU.S., from making money on the tissue, though the bank can\nprovide the tissue to its own service users, Odell said.  \u201cThey will get to distribute the dermis to some of their\ncustomers,\u201d Odell said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt enables\nthem to use more tissue. We can also market the tissue through\nselected partners in the U.S. to increase the coverage beyond\nwhat they can achieve.\u201d  The skin tissue produced with Tissue Regenix\u2019s dCell\ntechnology will be used in wound-care products for chronic skin\nulcers and potentially for burns and orthopedic and dental\npurposes, Odell said. The projected market for wound-healing\ndevices and equipment is $1.5 billion in 2016 in the U.S., he\nsaid. The agreement with the tissue bank covers other potential\napplications in orthopedics and vascular conditions.  Removing Cells  Tissue Regenix was unchanged at 8.88 pence in London\nyesterday, giving the company a market value of 57.9 million\npounds ($91 million). The stock has fallen 30 percent this year.\nThe company\u2019s  biggest shareholder  is  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , which owns\n29.5 percent of the shares, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg.  The dCell technology involves taking animal tissue and\nremoving cellular material from it that would cause humans to\nreject the implant. That allows doctors to replace worn out or\ndiseased body parts without anti-rejection drugs.  \u201cWe take human tissue, apply a series of very gentle\nwashes and remove the cells and DNA,\u201d Odell said. \u201cWhat you\nend up with is a matrix which, when it\u2019s placed into the wound\nspace, it repopulates with the patient\u2019s own cells. It\u2019s a\nnatural healing mechanism.\u201d  A  pilot study  of Tissue Regenix\u2019s technology found there\nwas complete wound healing in 12 of 20 patients who had 13-centimeter to 14-centimeter (5-inch to 6-inch) skin wounds that\nhad existed for an average of just under five years, Odell said.  Tissue Regenix is establishing a sales force to help\npromote the wound-care product in the U.S. in the first half of\nnext year and is talking to a number of distributors who are\ninterested in selling it there, too, Odell said. He declined to\nidentify the potential partners and said Tissue Regenix is\nweighing whether to ally with multinational companies or smaller\nU.S.-focused ones.  \u201cThere are pros and cons to both,\u201d Odell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t\nwant to become a little thing in somebody else\u2019s portfolio.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAndrea Gerlin in  London  at \n agerlin@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nKristen Hallam at \n khallam@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Invesco Plc was 23.577728271484375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Invesco Plc was ",
