The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nKKR & Co.  ended talks to buy\n Perpetual Ltd.  for at least A$1.75 billion ($1.73 billion),\ntriggering the biggest drop in the Australian fund manager\u2019s\nshares in more than two years.  The parties couldn\u2019t agree on acceptable terms, they said\nin separate statements today. KKR won\u2019t carry out due diligence\nand Sydney-based Perpetual doesn\u2019t expect further discussions\nwith the New York-based buyout firm, Perpetual said.  Perpetual\u2019s 15 percent  tumble  in Sydney trading erased most\nof the gain since announcing the approach in October. KKR\u2019s\nchallenge was to lock in the target\u2019s senior  investment managers ,\nled by head of equities  John Sevior , to avoid buying a business\nleft bare if key workers defect. That\u2019s not a typical private-\nequity investment, said  Shaun Manuell  at Equity Trustees Ltd.  \u201cIt didn\u2019t really fit the mould,\u201d said Manuell, who helps\nmanage A$750 million in Australian stocks at Equity Trustees in\nMelbourne. \u201cThey tend to look for steady, stable cash flows and\nimprove operational efficiencies. It\u2019s a difficult model for\nservice industries.\u201d  Perpetual  shares  fell to A$31.54 at the 4:10 p.m. local\ntime close in their biggest decline since October 2008. KKR\u2019s\nproposal was as high as A$40 a share. Before the approach was\nmade public nine weeks ago, Perpetual stock fetched A$30.97.  Not Acceptable  Perpetual said this month it signed confidentiality\nagreements with KKR and gave the private-equity firm access to\nsome data. An estate trustee since 1888, Perpetual had said the\nlegal implication of selling that unit was among issues to\nresolve before a bid could be recommended to shareholders.  \u201cThe parties have agreed that such an offer by KKR cannot\nbe formulated,\u201d Perpetual said in its statement. \u201cMutually\nacceptable terms were unable to be developed.\u201d  For KKR, the collapse of talks is at least the second\nfailure since July. That month, a group including Carlyle Group\nand TPG Capital beat KKR after bidding A$2 billion for\nAustralian hospital operator Healthscope Ltd. KKR bid alone,\npeople familiar with the matter said at the time.  \u201cKKR was satisfied with the level of access and\ninformation received,\u201d Ian Smith, an Adelaide-based spokesman\nfor the private-equity firm, said in a statement today. He\nconfirmed the two companies couldn\u2019t reach agreement.  Rising Currency  Perpetual on Oct. 15 was  valued  at 13.6 times earnings, 29\npercent below its average of 19.2 times over the past five years,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Perpetual was founded in Sydney in 1886 by a group that\nincluded Edmund Barton, who became Australia\u2019s first prime\nminister in 1901. The company on Nov. 30 managed more than A$27\nbillion in investment funds, according to its website.  KKR was seeking an asset manager in Australia\u2019s A$1.35\ntrillion pension-fund industry. The offer followed a surge by\nthe Australian dollar to parity with the U.S. currency in\nOctober, driving up the cost to foreign investors buying the\nnation\u2019s assets.  Perpetual, which is also searching for a new chief\nexecutive officer, reiterated that it expects underlying profit\nafter tax for the six months ending Dec. 31 of between A$35\nmillion and A$40 million.
