 "context": "The following article called 'Ratings Ratio Worst Since 2009 as Profits Slow: Credit Markets' was published on 2013-06-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCorporate creditworthiness in the\nU.S. is deteriorating at the fastest pace since 2009 with\nearnings growth slowing as yields rise from record lows.  The ratio of upgrades to downgrades fell to 0.89 times in\nthe first five months of the year after reaching a post-crisis\nhigh of 1.55 times in 2010, according to data from Moody\u2019s\nCapital Markets Group. At Standard & Poor\u2019s, the proportion has\ndeclined to 0.83 as of last week from 1 a year earlier.  The Federal Reserve has pumped more than $2.5 trillion into\nthe financial system since markets froze in 2008, helping\ncompanies improve profitability by lowering their borrowing\ncosts. Policy makers are considering curtailing $85 billion in\nmonthly bond buying intended to prop up the economy as analysts\nsurveyed by Bloomberg forecast earnings growth of 2.5 percent in\nthe current quarter, the least in a year.  \u201cThe trend of improving credit quality has slowed as\nprofits are slowing,\u201d Ben Garber, an economist at Moody\u2019s\nAnalytics in New York, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAs the\nrecovery matures, companies are liable to get more aggressive in\ntaking on share buybacks and dividends.\u201d  Buybacks, Dividends  Rather than using cash to pay down debt, companies in the\nS&P 500 Index are attempting to boost their share prices by\nbuying back almost $700 billion of stock this year, approaching\nthe 2007 record of $731 billion, said Rob Leiphart, an analyst\nat equity researcher Birinyi Associates in Westport,\n Connecticut .  Borrowers controlled by buyout firms are on pace to raise\nmore than $72.7 billion this year through dividends financed by\nbank loans, surpassing last year\u2019s record of $48.8 billion,\naccording to S&P Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary & Data.  After cutting expenses as much as they could to improve\nprofitability, companies \u201cwill need to see further revenue\ngrowth to boost earnings from here,\u201d Anthony Valeri, a market\nstrategist in San Diego with LPL Financial Corp., which oversees\n$350 billion, said in a telephone interview.  Elsewhere in credit markets, U.S. asset-backed bonds linked\nto auto debt are poised for the worst month in more than two\nyears. Yields on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds that\nguide U.S. home-loan rates headed for the first decline in six\ndays after reaching the highest since August 2011. The cost of\nprotecting corporate bonds from default in the U.S. fell for a\nsecond day.  Mortgage Yields  A Bloomberg  index  of Fannie Mae\u2019s current-coupon 30-year\nsecurities declined 0.04 percentage point to 3.48 percent as of\n12:10 p.m. in New York. The measure ended yesterday at 3.52\npercent and is up from 2.98 percent on June 18. The  average cost \nof new 30-year, fixed-rate home loans has climbed to 4.58\npercent from a record low 3.36 percent in December, according to\nBankrate.com data.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a\ncredit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or\nto speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 3.6 basis points to\na mid-price of 88.7 basis points, according to prices compiled\nby Bloomberg. The benchmark ended June 24 at the highest level\nsince December.  Europe Benchmark  In  London , the  Markit iTraxx Europe Index , tied to 125\ncompanies with investment-grade ratings, dropped 8.5 to 119.3.  The indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves\nand rise as it deteriorates. A basis point equals $1,000\nannually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of\ndebt market stress, declined 2.9 basis points to 14.75 basis\npoints. The gauge typically narrows when investors favor assets\nsuch as company debentures and widens when they seek the\nperceived safety of government securities.  Bonds of  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  are the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate securities by dealers today, accounting\nfor 3.04 percent of the volume of dealer trades of $1 million or\nmore, according to data from Trace, the bond-price reporting\nsystem of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Top-ranked securities tied to vehicle loans have lost 0.15\npercent this month, the largest decline since the securities\nfell 0.2 percent in November 2010, according to a Bank of\nAmerica Merrill Lynch index.  Downgrades, Upgrades  Investors are pulling back from auto debt, the largest part\nof the asset-backed market, threatening to constrain financing\nto borrowers with blemished credit histories. Subprime vehicle\ndebt accounted for 13.2 percent of asset-backed issuance this\nyear compared with 10.5 percent in 2012, Wells Fargo & Co.\nanalysts led by John McElravey said in a June 7 report.  Downgrades exceeded upgrades at Moody\u2019s Investors Service\nin the first five months of the year, with the New York-based\ncredit rater cutting rankings on 194 U.S. companies and lifting\n173. That\u2019s the weakest ratio since the firm cut 632 borrowers\nand raised 126 in the first five months of 2009 as markets\nstruggled to recover from the failure of Lehman Brothers\nHoldings Inc.  The long-term ratings of PepsiCo were cut one step to A1\nfrom Aa3 yesterday by Moody\u2019s, which said increasing leverage at\nthe world\u2019s largest snack food maker was inconsistent with its\nprior grade. Moody\u2019s also reduced the corporate family rating of\nTransDigm Inc. one level to B2 from B1, citing the Cleveland-based aircraft component maker\u2019s use of a proposed $700 million\nterm loan and a $500 million note offering to finance a\ndividend.  Sales Slow  S&P, the world\u2019s largest credit rater, has cut 138 U.S.\ncompanies this year through June 17 and upgraded 114 companies.  Credit markets have been roiled since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told Congress on May 22 that the central bank\u2019s policy-setting board could start scaling back purchases of $40 billion\nin mortgage bonds and $45 billion in Treasuries in its \u201cnext\nfew meetings\u201d if the U.S. employment outlook shows sustained\nimprovement. After the Fed\u2019s meeting on June 19, Bernanke said\nthe policy could end entirely by mid-2014.  With yields on 10-year Treasuries at the most in almost two\nyears, corporate borrowing costs have reached 4.28 percent, the\nhighest level since June 2012, according to the Bank of America\nMerrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Index.  Issuance has slowed, following the busiest May on record,\nas company yields have soared from a record low 3.35 percent on\nMay 2. Bond sales last week of $16.5 billion fell below the 2013\naverage for the fourth straight period, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  \u2018Apprehensive\u2019 Raters  Earnings growth at S&P 500 companies is poised to slow from\n2.7 percent in the first quarter and 8 percent in the final\nthree months of last year, Bloomberg  data  show.  The ratio of cash to total assets for S&P 500 companies\nstands at about 10.3 percent, close to a record high 10.4\npercent reached June 19, Bloomberg data show. The ratio was as\nlow as 5.6 percent in March 2007.  \u201cCompanies have done a great job cleaning up their balance\nsheets but now the focus has moved on to dividends and share\nbuybacks,\u201d Rajeev Sharma, who manages $1.5 billion of fixed-income assets in New York at First Investors Management Co.,\nsaid in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the ratings\nagencies get apprehensive.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMatt Robinson in New York at \n Mrobinson55@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAlan Goldstein at \n agoldstein5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Chevron Corporation was 81.74678039550781 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Chevron Corporation was ",
