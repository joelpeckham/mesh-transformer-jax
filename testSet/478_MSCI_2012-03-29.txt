 "context": "The following article called 'Palladium Seen Beating Gold With Record Car Sales: Commodities' was published on 2012-03-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInvestors are buying palladium at\nthe fastest pace in more than a year as analysts predict rising\ndemand and declining supply will turn this quarter\u2019s worst-\nperforming precious metal into the best by December.  Holdings in palladium-backed exchange-traded products rose\n14 percent this year, poised for the best quarter since the end\nof 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The metal will average\n$850 an ounce in the final three months of 2012, 32 percent more\nthan now, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts\nsurveyed by Bloomberg. They expect a gain of 15 percent for\ngold, 13 percent for silver and 11 percent for platinum.  Palladium lagged behind other metals this year on concern\nabout slowing growth in vehicle sales in  China , the world\u2019s\nlargest car market. Autocatalysts account for 65 percent of\ndemand, according to  Barclays Capital . Prices are poised to rise\nbecause carmakers are still using the most metal ever, with the\nprospect of shortages because of less supply from state reserves\nin  Russia , the biggest producer, the bank estimates.  \u201cI like palladium the best among precious metals, it\u2019s\nrelatively cheap compared to the others,\u201d said  Bart Melek , the\nhead of commodity strategy at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto and\nthe most accurate price forecaster tracked by Bloomberg Rankings\nin the eight quarters through the end of 2011. \u201cAutocatalyst\ndemand for palladium should grow. Russian government stocks will\nlimit supply growth.\u201d  Mine Production  Palladium fell 1.8 percent to $643.75 in  London  this year,\nbeaten by all other precious metals for the first time since the\nthird quarter. Gold rose 5.7 percent, silver 15 percent and\nplatinum 16 percent. The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI gauge of 24\ncommodities added 6.4 percent and the MSCI All-Country World\n Index (MXWD)  of equities appreciated 10 percent. Treasuries lost 1.2\npercent, a Bank of America Corp.  index (MXWD)  shows.  The increase in palladium ETP holdings means investors now\nhold 58.9 metric tons, equal to more than eight months of\nRussian mine output and valued at about $1.2 billion, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show. Gold held through ETPs rose 1.4\npercent to 2,389.8 tons as platinum increased 8.5 percent to\n43.5 tons and silver added 2.5 percent to 17,719 tons.  Sales from Russian reserves, created during a glut in the\n1970s and 1980s, will probably drop by 60 percent to 300,000\nounces this year, Barclays estimates. Supply from those\nstockpiles, a state secret, won\u2019t exceed 4.5 tons (144,678\nounces) this year or next and may end in 2014, Interfax reported\nin October, citing an unidentified Finance Ministry official\nlinked to Gokhran, the state-run body managing the inventory.  Scrap Metal  Declining Russian sales will combine with the smallest\nSouth African output in three years. Supply from mines and\nstockpiles will drop 6.9 percent to 6.91 million ounces this\nyear, Barclays estimates. An 11 percent expansion in scrap metal\nto 2.43 million ounces still won\u2019t be enough to meet demand,\nleaving a 215,000-ounce shortage, the bank predicts.  Sales of cars and light commercial vehicles will rise 5.3\npercent to a record 79.3 million units this year, according to\nLMC Automotive Ltd., a research company in Oxford,  England .\nCarmakers will use 6.24 million ounces of palladium in catalytic\nconverters, 5.5 percent more than in 2011, Barclays estimates.  Actual consumption may be lower after an official of the\nChina Association of Automobile Manufacturers said March 20 that\nvolume growth would probably miss its original 2012 target of 8\npercent. Car sales had their slowest start to a year since 2005\nin January and February, association data show. Premier  Wen Jiabao  cut the country\u2019s annual growth target for gross domestic\nproduct to 7.5 percent this month, the least since 2004.  European Manufacturing  \u201cWe think people should be leaning toward monetary assets\nrather than industrial,\u201d said James Dailey, who manages $215\nmillion at TEAM Financial Asset Management LLC in Harrisburg,\n Pennsylvania . \u201cIf you want to be invested in a metal choose\ngold. You don\u2019t want to mess with industrial metals right now.\u201d  At least 59 percent of platinum and palladium is used in\nindustrial applications from electronics to autocatalysts that\nconvert emissions into less harmful substances, Johnson Matthey\nPlc estimates. Fifty-three percent of silver goes into products\nsuch as solar panels and batteries, according to The Silver\nInstitute, a Washington-based industry group. About 11 percent\nof gold is used in industry, World Gold Council data show.  Catalytic Converters  Shares (GMKN)  of OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world\u2019s biggest\npalladium producer, rose 8.2 percent this year. The Moscow-based\ncompany will report a 4.2 percent decline in net income to $4.49\nbillion in 2012, according to the average of 12 analyst\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Rhodium, a platinum-group metal also used in autocatalysts,\nwas unchanged at $1,400 an ounce this year, according to London-\nbased Johnson Matthey, which has made about one in three of the\nworld\u2019s catalytic converters. Ruthenium climbed 9.1 percent to\n$120 an ounce and iridium was unchanged at $1,085 an ounce. Both\nare also so-called PGMs.  Platinum is set for its best quarter in three years after\nworkers at  Impala Platinum Ltd. (IMP) \u2019s Rustenburg mine, the world\u2019s\nbiggest, started a month-long strike in January. It will average\n$1,800 an ounce in the fourth quarter, the analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg predict. The supply surplus will narrow to 37,000\nounces this year, from 364,000 ounces, according to Barclays.  Platinum now costs more than 2.5 times as much as\npalladium, compared with a five-year ratio of 3.6, data compiled\nby Bloomberg show.  Silver is headed for its best quarter in a year, and will\naverage $36 an ounce in the final three months, the forecasts\ncompiled by Bloomberg show. Holdings fell by more than 800 tons\nin 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors may\nbuy 2,000 tons through ETPs this year, Morgan Stanley predicts.  Central Bank  Gold is advancing for a 12th consecutive year and will\naverage $1,900 an ounce in the fourth quarter, the analysts\npredict. Prices slid more than 7 percent in the past month as\nsigns that U.S. growth is accelerating pared investors\u2019\nexpectations the  Federal Reserve  will buy more debt. The central\nbank bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of quantitative\neasing that ended in June 2011, during which gold appreciated\nabout 70 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said March 26 that while he\u2019s\nencouraged by the decline in the  unemployment rate , continued\naccommodative monetary policy will be needed. Gold jumped 1.7\npercent. The central bank has pledged to keep  interest rates \nnear zero through late 2014. Precious metals generally earn\nreturns only through price gains, diminishing their allure as\ninterest rates rise.  U.S. consumer prices increased 2.9 percent in the 12 months\nended in February, the Labor Department reported March 16. While\nthat\u2019s down from as much as 5.6 percent in 2008, it\u2019s still 2.65\npercentage points more than the Fed\u2019s target rate for overnight\nloans between banks of zero to 0.25 percent.  \u201cNegative real interest rates are very much a proven\nhistoric driver for the precious metals sector and we can\u2019t see\nany sign of that changing any time soon,\u201d said  Charles Morris ,\nwho oversees about $2.5 billion at HSBC Global Asset Management\nin London. \u201cAll the factors are lined up for precious metals to\nhave a run. The big picture is that there\u2019s a ton of money out\nthere and conditions are very loose around the world.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nNicholas Larkin in London at \n nlarkin1@bloomberg.net ;\nDebarati Roy in New York at \n droy5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nClaudia Carpenter at \n ccarpenter2@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 34.17353820800781 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
