 "context": "The following article called 'Peso Becoming Top Carry-Trade Currency as Exports Soar: Argentina Credit' was published on 2010-11-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nArgentina\u2019s peso is becoming the most\nattractive carry-trade currency in the world.  The peso\u2019s so-called Sharpe ratio, a gauge that measures\nthe reward for the risk investors take, tripled to 10.1 over the\npast month through yesterday, the highest among 35 currencies\ntracked by Bloomberg. The peso also posted the biggest drop in\nvolatility among emerging currencies this year, making it more\nappealing to investors who buy higher-yielding currencies with\nfunds borrowed in countries with lower interest rates.  Argentina\u2019s  overnight rate  of 10.13 percent compares with\nkey benchmarks of 1 percent or lower in the U.S., Japan and\nEurope. Surging soybean exports are fueling the fastest economic\ngrowth since 2005 and prompting analysts to boost their currency\nforecast to the strongest level in two years.  \u201cCapital is returning to Argentina, pointing to a stable\ncurrency,\u201d said  Nick Chamie , the global head of emerging\nmarkets at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. \u201cCombined with the\nyields, it is the most attractive currency in the universe we\nwatch.\u201d  The peso gained 0.1 percent in October, ending a nine-month\nslide and paring its decline this year to 4 percent. The\ncurrency will slide by 2 percent to 4.04 per dollar by year-end\nand drop to 4.3 by December 2011, according to the median\nforecast of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. In August, the\nanalysts predicted a decline to 4.2 per dollar by yearend and\n4.65 by the end of 2011.  Trade Surplus  A record soybean harvest and growing exports to Brazil and\nChina will push growth in South America\u2019s second-largest economy\nto 9 percent this year after a 0.9 percent expansion in 2009,\naccording to the central bank. Argentina\u2019s trade surplus widened\nto $1.07 billion in September, the highest in three months.  Buying the peso with dollar loans returned 0.8 percent\nsince Oct. 1, including interest-rate payments, the third-most\nin six major Latin American currencies after the Mexican peso\nand the Brazilian real, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty nice trade,\u201d said  Alejandro Urbina , who\nowns peso-denominated bonds as an emerging-market debt portfolio\nmanager at Chicago-based Silva Capital Management, which has\nabout $800 million in advisory and management. \u201cIt\u2019s all about\nthat large yield differential. The currency is very stable and\nthe growth picture is constructive.\u201d  Implied volatility of one-month options for the peso\ndropped to 4.4 percent, from 5.5 percent at the end of last\nyear, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Similar gauges\nfor the South African rand stand at 15 percent, 12 percent for\nthe Brazilian real and 11.8 percent for the Colombian peso.  Peso Forwards  The implied yield on one-year non-deliverable forwards for\nthe Argentine peso is 10.1 percent, compared with 2.7 percent\nfor the Chilean peso and 3.4 percent for the Mexican currency,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yields that Argentine assets offer are insufficient to\ncompensate investors for the risk that the peso may tumble,\naccording to  Guillermo Mondino , head of Latin America research\nat Barclays Plc in New York. The peso has lost 23 percent since\n2007 and 75 percent since Argentina defaulted on its debt in\n2001, the third-biggest drop in the world after the Venezuelan\nbolivar and Iranian rial.  Barclays and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimate inflation is\nmore than double the government\u2019s 11.1 percent rate. Economists\nhave questioned the accuracy of inflation data since 2007, when\nPresident  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner \u2019s late husband and\npredecessor,  Nestor Kirchner , changed personnel at the agency\nthat measures consumer prices. Fernandez has said the data is\naccurate.  \u201cIt\u2019s a lot riskier than people acknowledge,\u201d Mondino\nsaid. \u201cThe headline risk in Argentina is very high. When the\nmarket turns, people can get hurt very much.\u201d  Total Return  The Argentine peso is also \u201cilliquid,\u201d making it more\ndifficult for investors to sell the currency when they want to\nexit the trade, Mondino said.  Investing in the peso-denominated money-market instruments\ndelivered a total return of 3.7 percent this year, trailing the\n15.1 percent gain in the South African rand and 14.4 percent\nadvance in the Colombian peso, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg.  \u201cWe don\u2019t see much value in the peso relative to other\ncurrencies in the region,\u201d said  Vitali Meschoulam , a strategist\nat Morgan Stanley in New York.  The peso fell 0.1 percent today to 3.9594 per dollar.  The cost of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment\nfor five years with credit-default swaps fell 31 basis points,\nor 0.31 percentage point, today to 601, according to data\ncompiled by CMA. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value\nin exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent\nshould a government or company fail to adhere to its debt\nagreements.  Presidential Elections  The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine dollar\nbonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 32 basis points today\nto 486, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The gap is down from\n846 on July 1.  Fernandez\u2019s government will seek to keep the peso stable\nahead of presidential elections next year, said RBC\u2019s Chamie.\nKirchner said in July that either he or Fernandez would run for\npresident next year.  \u201cThey want to show stability,\u201d said Chamie, who\nrecommends his clients buy the peso in non-deliverable forwards\nto pick up yield.
