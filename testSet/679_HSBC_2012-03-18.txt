 "context": "The following article called 'Standard Chartered Hopes for London Yuan Center This Year' was published on 2012-03-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStandard Chartered Plc (STAN)  Chief\nExecutive  Peter Sands  said he hopes  London  will as soon as this\nyear become an offshore yuan center where companies can raise\nfunds denominated in the Chinese currency.  \u201cLondon is the logical place for it to happen,\u201d Sands,\n50, said in an interview yesterday. \u201cI would hope it would\nhappen this year but there are a number of things that have to\ncome together to make it possible.\u201d  China designated  Hong Kong  as the only current offshore\ncenter for yuan trading after allowing settlement of trade using\nthe currency in 2009. That\u2019s been a boon for banks including\n Standard Chartered , which underwrote 18.9 billion yuan ($3\nbillion) of bonds denominated in the Chinese currency in Hong\nKong last year. In addition to London,  Singapore  is also seeking\nto become a center for yuan trading.  \u201cSingapore may well be playing a role as well but London\nis in a different position because London is the natural place\nas a bridge to the West,\u201d Sands said in Beijing, where he\u2019s\nattending a forum. \u201cI think it will play quite a distinct role\ncompared to either Hong Kong or Singapore.\u201d  In Hong Kong, Standard Chartered has trailed only  HSBC\nHoldings Plc (5)  in underwriting Dim Sum bonds. HSBC underwrote 32.9\nbillion yuan of bonds in the city last year and more than 11\nbillion yuan this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nStandard Chartered has underwritten 5.6 billion yuan of Dim Sum\nbonds this year, the data show.  Yuan Settlement  The starting point for London would be to increase yuan\ntrade settlement through the city, which would increase the\namount of yuan deposits and create a market for yuan bond\nissuances, Sands said. The bank has \u201cdedicated resources\u201d in\nLondon dealing with the yuan, he said.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced in January that\nit plans to lengthen trading of the yuan by five hours by June,\nallowing London-based institutions the opportunity to expand\ntheir share of yuan trading outside China.  That announcement was made as U.K. Chancellor of the\nExchequer  George Osborne  visited Hong Kong and Beijing. Osborne,\nwho said he would discuss development of an offshore yuan market\nin London with Chinese leaders, met with officials including\nVice Premier  Wang Qishan  and central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan during his January trip.  \u2018Critical Mass\u2019  \u201cAt the moment, there isn\u2019t that much renminbi in London\nso it will require a certain critical mass of activity to get it\ngoing,\u201d Sands said yesterday. Renminbi is another name for the\nChinese currency. \u201cOur sense and our experience from Hong Kong\nis as soon as we get the component parts of infrastructure and\nthe regulatory frameworks agreed that it will happen pretty\nquickly,\u201d he said.  London isn\u2019t the only place interested in becoming a yuan\ntrading center.  China \u2019s central bank may allow Singapore to host\na yuan-clearing bank, Deutsche Bank AG strategists Linan Liu and\nDennis Tan wrote in a December report.  Japan  is also considering\nthe set up of a market for yuan trading, the Nikkei newspaper\nreported last week.  In the fourth quarter, London accounted for 46 percent of\nyuan foreign exchange transactions done outside of Hong Kong and\nChina, according to research by the  Society for Worldwide\nInterbank Financial Telecommunications . London accounted for 30\npercent of yuan payments sent and received outside of Hong Kong\nand China, according to SWIFT.  Hong Kong accounted for 78 percent of yuan payments sent\nand received outside China in December, according to SWIFT.
