 "context": "The following article called 'Best Buy Poison Put Elusive in Schulze Offer: Corporate Finance' was published on 2012-08-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBest Buy (BBY)  Co. founder Richard Schulze\nsays his takeover offer gives the world\u2019s largest electronics\nretailer its best shot at competing with  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and\n Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Bondholders aren\u2019t convinced.  Best Buy has $1.5 billion of  securities  that have a so-\ncalled poison put, which requires the company to purchase the\nnotes at 101 cents on the dollar in the event of an acquisition\ncombined with a ratings downgrade. A total of $1 billion of that\ndebt is trading as much as 11 cents below that repurchase price,\nindicating bondholders believe a buyout isn\u2019t imminent.  Talks between Schulze, 71, and Richfield, Minnesota-based\nBest Buy broke down on Aug. 19 and resumed two days later after\nthe company posted quarterly  earnings  that trailed analysts\u2019\nestimates. The retailer has been closing big-box stores and\nparing jobs to generate savings for promotions and training\nstore employees as it struggles to convince investors that its\nstrategy is still relevant.  \u201cWe don\u2019t think the credit market is putting much stock in\nthe transaction,\u201d Joscelyn MacKay, a credit analyst at\n Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cThere are just a lot of outside issues that we think are\nhurdles to get this deal done.\u201d  Online retailers like Amazon are willing to accept lower\nmargins than its brick and mortar counterparts, putting pressure\non companies like Best Buy to defend market share and reduce\ncosts through closing stores, MacKay said.  Bruce Hight, a Best Buy spokesman, and David Reno, a\nspokesman for Schulze, both declined to comment.  \u2018Further Downgrades\u2019  Best Buy\u2019s $650 million of 5.5 percent senior unsecured\nbonds due in March 2021 traded at 90 cents on the dollar to\nyield 7.08 percent yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price\nreporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\nIts $350 million of 3.75 percent notes due March 2016 are at 93\ncents, yielding 5.978 percent.  \u201cAny Schulze-led buyout would require incurring a large\namount of debt that would require further ratings downgrades,\u201d\nAlexander Diaz-Matos, an analyst at the credit research firm\nCovenant Review LLC, said in a telephone interview. \u201cEven if\nthe bonds are rated below investment-grade by all three  ratings\nagencies  prior to a buyout, it\u2019s extremely likely given the\nleverage required, a further downgrade would take place.\u201d  Without the buyout, \u201cyou\u2019re left without a 101 percent\nchange of control right and a deteriorating business,\u201d he said.  Bond Coupons  Best Buy\u2019s $500 million of 6.75 percent bonds due in July\n2013 compensate investors for downgrades, with the  interest rate \nincreasing 25 basis points for every level below junk the rating\nfalls until it reaches B, according to a Dec. 15, 2008,\nprospectus. Those bonds are trading at 103.1 cents, from as high\nas 107.3 cents on Oct. 11, Trace data show. Investors in that\ndebt are less concerned with buyout speculation as the maturity\ndate ticks closer, according to Diaz-Matos.  Once a $29 billion company, Best Buy has wiped out almost\n80 percent of its market value as it lost sales to Internet-\nbased retailers such as Amazon.com and  discount stores  like Wal-\nMart. It posted a net loss of $1.23 billion on revenue of $50.7\nbillion for the year that ended in March, its first annual loss\nsince 1991, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Best Buy and Schulze reached an agreement Aug. 27 allowing\nhim to conduct due diligence and bring a fully financed,\ndefinitive proposal to the company within 60 days. If that offer\nis rejected, he must wait until January to pursue an acquisition\nthrough other means, the company said in a statement.  Private Equity  \u201cThe board probably was frightened by the falling stock\nprice and felt that to cover itself it had to agree to allow Mr.\nSchulze to make an offer,\u201d Carol Levenson, an analyst at debt-\nresearch firm Gimme Credit LLC in Chicago, said in an e-mail.\n\u201cPerhaps they are calling his bluff about his ability to raise\nthe cash.\u201d  The agreement gave Schulze access to financial data that\nmay help him line up  private-equity  firms he needs to fund a\ntakeover of the company he founded more than four decades ago\nand left in June.  Best Buy fell to $17.72 as of 11:09 a.m. in  New York . The\n shares  have declined 24 percent this year and trade below\nSchulze\u2019s Aug. 6 offer of as much as $26 a share, or about $9\nbillion. That \u201ctells you folks don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely,\u201d Noel\nHebert, chief investment officer at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-\nbased Concannon Wealth Management LLC, said in an e-mail.  Like Junk  Traders already are treating some Best Buy debt like junk.\nAt 7.08 percent, the yield on the 5.5 percent notes due March\n2021 was higher than the average yield on BB rated bonds at 5.63\npercent on Aug. 28, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nindex data.  Standard & Poor\u2019s  lowered Best Buy\u2019s  credit rating  to BB+\nfrom BBB- on Aug. 6, as a result of Schulze\u2019s pitch. Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Services gives the company a Baa2 grade, two steps\nabove high-yield.  \u201cThe transaction, if completed, would materially weaken\nBest Buy\u2019s credit protection metrics because we believe it will\nadd a significant amount of debt,\u201d S&P analysts Jayne Ross and\nCharles Pinson-Rose wrote in the note.  Even without the buyout, \u201cmanagement still hasn\u2019t been\nable to keep the leverage in line,\u201d MacKay said. \u201cThis is a\ncompany that is going south. Yes, this company is investment-\ngrade right now, but in 2016, this paper might be more like a\nsingle B.\u201d  New CEO  The average yield on single B bonds was 7.196 percent Aug.\n28, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Best Buy named Hubert Joly as its new chief executive\nofficer on Aug. 20 to oversee a turnaround plan that entails\nshifting to smaller locations in a bid to fend off rivals.  The next day, the company reported second-quarter profit\nthat trailed analysts\u2019 estimates and will no longer provide an\nearnings forecast as sales of computers and televisions dropped.\nExcluding restructuring charges and other items, profit was 20\ncents a share, the company said, missing analysts\u2019 average\nestimate of 31 cents. Revenue of $10.5 billion last quarter is\ndown from $11.3 billion in the same period last year.  The company\u2019s leverage, or adjusted total debt to earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, was 1.9\ntimes May 5, according to the S&P rating report. That will\nincrease to 3.8 times after a $9 billion transaction, the rating\ncompany wrote.  Credit Swaps  Credit swaps protecting against the company\u2019s default for\nfive years have climbed to 14.3 percent upfront yesterday,\naccording to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill\nCos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately\nnegotiated market. That\u2019s in addition to 5 percent a year,\nmeaning it would cost $1.43 million initially and $500,000\nannually to protect $10 million of Best Buy\u2019s debt.  The credit-swap prices have climbed to levels implying the\ndebt is rated B3, according to Moody\u2019s Corp.\u2019s capital markets\nresearch group, seven steps below its actual rating. Credit\nswaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its\nobligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very tough deal, especially given where the\nCDS are trading,\u201d Melissa Weiler, a  money manager  who helps\noversee $10 billion at Crescent Capital Group LP, said in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cConsumers still like to go to a store to\nlook at and touch electronics. But the size of Best Buy stores\nneeds to shrink and it needs to significantly improve its\nbusiness online. It is a business that can survive, it is just\ngoing to have to dramatically change how it operates.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMary Childs in New York at \n mchilds5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAlan Goldstein at \n agoldstein5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 58.579620361328125 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
