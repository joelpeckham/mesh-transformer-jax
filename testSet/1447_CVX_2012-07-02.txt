 "context": "The following article called 'South Korea Shipbuilders to Post First Export Drop in 19 Years' was published on 2012-07-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSouth Korean shipbuilders, who\naccount for about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s exports, may post\ntheir first annual drop in overseas shipments in 19 years after\na slump in orders during the global financial crisis.  Full-year exports of ships and offshore products may fall\nto $43 billion from a record $54.5 billion in 2011, the  Ministry\nof Knowledge Economy  said in an e-mailed reply to Bloomberg News\nquestions yesterday. The value of first-half deliveries declined\n20 percent to $25.5 billion, based on preliminary data, it said.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540) , the world\u2019s largest shipyard,\nand other Korean shipbuilders are handing over fewer vessels\nthis year after the credit crunch and falling freight rates\ncaused orders to collapse from late 2008 into 2009. The yards,\nwhich take about three years to deliver vessels, are also\nfocusing more on offshore equipment and larger ships that take\nlonger to build, suggesting exports will rebound in 2013, said\nUm Kyung A, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities Co. in  Seoul .  \u201cThe credit crisis pretty much wiped out orders in 2009\nand that\u2019s now starting to show,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should get\nbetter next year when a lot of the offshore and big container-\nship orders start to be delivered.\u201d  The drop in ship and offshore project deliveries\ncontributed to South Korean exports falling in four of the first\nsix months of the year. The won has also dropped about 6.9\npercent in the past year against the dollar, the third worst\nperformance among 11 major Asian currencies tracked by\nBloomberg.  Trade Balance  \u201cShip exports greatly affect  South Korea \u2019s total\nexports,\u201d said Suh Jung Wook, head of research at  Korea\nDevelopment Bank , in Seoul. \u201cThe impact on the  trade balance  is\nalso great, given that there\u2019s very few components imported from\noverseas.\u201d  Ships, offshore units and components were South Korea\u2019s\nbiggest export category last year with $54.5 billion of sales,\nbased on  Korea Customs Service  data. Oil products were the\nsecond-largest segment at $59.6 billion.  Global ship orders plunged 69 percent from a year earlier\nin 2009 to 56.7 million deadweight tons, the least since the\nbeginning of boom of 2002, according to Clarkson data. Of that\ntotal, South Korean yards won contracts for 19.2 million\ndeadweight tons, 72 percent less than in 2008.  Hyundai Heavy, Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and  Daewoo\nShipbuilding (042660)  & Marine Engineering Co., the world\u2019s three biggest\nshipyards based in South Korea, all missed their order targets\nin 2009.  Hyundai Heavy fell 0.4 percent to 256,500 won in Seoul\ntrading yesterday. The Ulsan, South Korea-based shipbuilder is\nlittle changed this year, compared with an 8.9 percent gain for\nDaewoo Shipbuilding and a 37 percent jump for Samsung Heavy.  LNG Facilities  Hyundai Heavy doesn\u2019t have any major deliveries scheduled\nfor this year. In 2013, it will hand over processing facilities\ntotaling $2.06 billion for a  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  liquefied-natural-gas\nproject in  Australia .  Daewoo Shipbuilding also doesn\u2019t have any significant\ndeliveries pending this year. In 2013, it plans to hand over two\n18,000-container ships to A.P. Moeller Maersk A/S. The vessels\nare among 20 ordered by the Copenhagen-based shipping line that\nwill be the largest cargo-box ships afloat. It will also deliver\na $1.8 billion floating oil production vessel to Total SA next\nyear.  South Korean shipyards won orders for $11.7 billion of\nvessels in the first five months of the year, 50 percent less\nthan a year earlier, according to Clarkson data. The tally,\nwhich excludes offshore equipment, was more than triple the $3.6\nbillion of orders won by yards in  China , based on the data.
