 "context": "The following article called 'Deutsche Bank Faces Top Surcharge as FSB Shuffles Tiers' was published on 2012-11-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Bank AG (DBK)  would be required to\nhold more capital and  Bank of America Corp. \u2019s burden stands to\nbe reduced as global regulators shuffled the competitive balance\namong the world\u2019s biggest banks.  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \njoin Deutsche Bank as firms that will be targeted for a capital\nsurcharge of 2.5 percent, according to an updated list published\nyesterday by the Financial Stability Board. The change means\nBank of America already exceeds requirements, while Deutsche\nBank would be more than 2 percentage points below the new\nminimum of 9.5 percent.  \u201cThat limits earnings potential for Citigroup, JPMorgan\nand Deutsche Bank compared to Bank of America, all other things\nbeing equal, so it\u2019s certainly a competitive advantage for\nthem,\u201d said  David Kass , a professor at the University of\n Maryland \u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business.  The capital surcharges for systemic banks, set in half-\npercentage-point increments ranging from 1 percent to 2.5\npercent, come on top of agreements by the  Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision  to more than triple the core reserves they\nmust hold against possible losses. The extra requirements are\ncalculated against banks\u2019 interconnectedness, size, complexity,\nglobal reach, and the ability of other firms to take over their\nfunctions if they fail.  RBS, Dexia  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will be subject to a 1.5 percent\nbuffer, down 1 percentage point from last year\u2019s  list . Three\nbanks --  Dexia SA (DEXB) ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and Commerzbank AG -\n- were removed from the list, the FSB said.  Standard Chartered\nPlc (STAN)  and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , which weren\u2019t\nincluded in 2011, were added to the lowest surcharge group.  Dexia is being broken up by the French and Belgian\ngovernments after losing access to unsecured funding. The other\ntwo have seen a \u201cdecline in their global systemic importance,\u201d\nthe FSB said. The quality of data it used in determining the\nlist \u201cimproved considerably\u201d from last year, the group said.  \u201cIt would have been more helpful if FSB explained why some\nbanks fell off the list and why some joined or moved around\nbuckets -- does this mean the framework was wrong last year?\u201d\nsaid  Barbara Matthews , managing director of BCM International\nRegulatory Analytics LLC, a Washington-based consulting firm.\n\u201cThis is a classic case of informational asymmetry between\nbanks, regulators and markets that perpetuates moral hazard.\u201d  Capital Levels  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  last year\npredicted a \u201crace to the top\u201d as lenders tried to meet\nrequirements well before the deadline and said his company would\nwin business because of its higher capital levels.  Investment banks that aren\u2019t in the top group will have to\nsee if clients care whether they have as much capital as\nCitigroup and JPMorgan, said  Christopher Wheeler , a London-based\nanalyst at Mediobanca SpA.  \u201cThe guys at the top are stuck, and the guys below are\nscratching their heads and saying, \u2018Do we have to go up and be\nin line to be competitive,\u2019\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cIf your clients\ndon\u2019t worry, you\u2019re probably fine\u201d to hold lower equity\ncapital, he said.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  may face surcharges of 2\npercent. BNP, based in Paris, and Edinburgh-based RBS were\npreviously targeted for the highest 2.5 percent surcharges.\n Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America, the second-\nlargest U.S. lender, now faces  capital requirements  a full point\nlower than JPMorgan and Citigroup, the first- and third-biggest.  \u2018Head-Scratcher\u2019  \u201cBank of America is a head-scratcher,\u201d said Christopher Kotowski, an Oppenheimer & Co. analyst. \u201cHow you would come to\nthe conclusion that Bank of America is less of a SIFI and less\nrisky than JPMorgan and Citibank is just a real puzzler.\u201d  Bank of America said last month that it had an estimated\nBasel III common equity ratio of 8.97 percent, above the 8.5\npercent it would need with the surcharge in yesterday\u2019s list.\nStill, U.S. regulators may be cautious in letting the lender\nreturn capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or\nbuybacks, Kotowski said.  Deutsche Bank said earlier this week that it plans to have\na Basel III ratio of 7.2 percent at the end of this year, below\nthe 9.5 percent it would need with a 2.5 percent surcharge. The\nlender set a target of more than 10 percent by March 31, 2015.  \u201cThis ups the ante for Deutsche Bank,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been in a great hurry to get where they probably\nneed to be. We\u2019ve been rattling on about how weak their capital\nis.\u201d  Deutsche Bank  Then-CEO  Josef Ackermann  said last year he was proud that\n Germany \u2019s biggest lender was considered the world\u2019s most\nsystemically important financial institution by Japanese\nregulators.  Japan \u2019s Financial Services Agency and central bank\nranked Deutsche Bank the most important among 60 peers based on\nthe impact their failure would have on the global financial\nsystem, the Mainichi newspaper reported in December 2010.  Some banks in the European Union already face requirements\nto hold core reserves equivalent to 9 percent of their risk-\nweighted assets, after sovereign-debt writedowns, under plans\nadopted by EU regulators in response to the bloc\u2019s fiscal\ncrisis.  9 Percent  The definition of what banks can count as capital to meet\nthe international surcharges is stricter than that used by the\nEU, which allows lenders to use some contingent convertible\ninstruments to meet the 9 percent threshold.  Standard Chartered already exceeds the capital levels it\nneeds to meet the requirements, said Doris Fan, a Hong Kong-\nbased spokeswoman for the bank. \u201cOur inclusion in the list does\nnot change the way we run the bank or think about our  capital\nstructure ,\u201d she said in an e-mail.  Large international lenders would have faced a 374.1\nbillion-euro shortfall ($483.8 billion) in the capital needed to\nmeet the Basel capital rules had they been in force at the end\nof 2011, according to data published by the Basel committee in\nSeptember. The figure factors in the surcharges for globally\nsystemic banks.  Other changes included  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,\nwhich moved from 1 percent to 1.5 percent, pushing its total\nrequirement to 8.5 percent.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  moved down half a\npoint to 1 percent.  \u201cOur global scale and activities probably prompted the\nadjustment,\u201d Yuji Okumura, a spokesman for Tokyo-based\nMitsubishi UFJ, Japan\u2019s biggest publicly traded bank, said by\nphone today. He said the lender already had an estimated Basel\nIII common equity ratio of at least 9 percent as of June 30.  Japan Megabanks  Japanese Financial Services Minister Ikko Nakatsuka told\nreporters he\u2019s not concerned that Mitsubishi UFJ\u2019s proposed\ncapital surcharge was raised.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group\nInc. (8316)  and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , the country\u2019s other two\nso-called megabanks, remain on the list with targeted surcharges\nof 1 percent.  The capital buffers are scheduled to be phased in beginning\nJan. 1, 2016, the FSB has said. The updated list was based on\nbanks\u2019 data at the end of 2011, the group said. The FSB said\nlast year regulators would update the list annually, with each\nrevision to be published in November. The 2014 version will be\nthe first to be applied.  \u201cA lot of work remains to be done on determining what risk\nweightings these banks will ultimately be subject to,\u201d  Richard Reid , research director for the International Centre for\nFinancial Regulation in  London , said in an e-mail. It\u2019s also\nunclear how capital rules will \u201cbe applied in the coming\nyears.\u201d  Shrink Further  Regulators have said the list may shrink further as lenders\ntake steps to reduce their systemic importance and ensure they\ncan be wound down if they fail.  \u201cThere should come a day\u201d when the list is blank, Stephen Cecchetti, head of the monetary and economic department at the\n Bank for International Settlements , said in an October speech.\n\u201cThat day will come when either the institutions change, the\nrules change, or both.\u201d  The FSB published the updated list ahead of a meeting of\nGroup of 20 finance ministers starting Nov. 4. The FSB brings\ntogether central bankers, regulators and government officials\nfrom G-20 nations to coordinate financial rule-making.  Others included on the list are Bank of  New York  Mellon\nCorp.,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  Morgan\nStanley (MS) ,  UBS AG (UBSN) , Bank of China Ltd., Groupe BPCE,  ING Groep NV (INGA) ,\n Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ,  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , State\nStreet Corp.,  Unicredit SpA (UCG) , and Wells Fargo & Co.  \u201cCiti\u2019s estimated Tier 1 common ratio of 8.6 percent under\nBasel 3 at the end of the third quarter is among the highest in\nthe industry,\u201d said  Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for  New York- \nbased Citigroup. \u201cWe expect to continue to generate capital\nthrough earnings and divestitures of non-core assets.\u201d  Jerry Dubrowski , a Bank of America spokesman, JPMorgan\u2019s\nMark Kornblau and BNP\u2019s Cesaltine Gregorio all declined to\ncomment on the FSB report.  Duncan King , a spokesman for Deutsche\nBank, and Mary Guzman, a Credit Agricole spokeswoman in New\nYork, didn\u2019t immediately respond to e-mailed requests for\ncomment, as did a spokesman for Lloyds.
