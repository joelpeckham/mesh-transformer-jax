 "context": "The following article called 'VeriSign, Glaxo, Moody's, Goldman, J&J, Air France-KLM in Court News' was published on 2010-07-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVeriSign Inc. , the biggest operator\nof computers that direct Internet traffic, must face an\nantitrust lawsuit claiming it overcharged for .com and .net\ndomain names, a federal appeals court ruled.  \n The San Francisco-based court ruled July 9 that a lower\ncourt was wrong to dismiss a suit filed by the Coalition for\nICANN Transparency. CFIT, an organization of Web site owners,\nclaimed VeriSign violated antitrust laws by charging\nartificially high prices for the domain names and restrained\ncompetition in its renewal contracts, according to the ruling.  \n VeriSign, based in Mountain View, California, operates the\n.com and .net domain name registries under a contract with the\nInternet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers on behalf of\nthe U.S. Commerce Department.  \n In its lawsuit, CFIT asked the lower court to block\nVeriSign\u2019s registration service for expiring domain names based\non claims VeriSign attempted to monopolize that \u201callegedly\nseparate market,\u201d according to the ruling.  \n The district court \u201cfailed to appreciate the seriousness\nof the allegations of anticompetitive conduct\u201d and by rejecting\nthe existence of a separate market for expiring domain names,\n\u201cimproperly relied on already outdated authority,\u201d the appeals\ncourt said.  \n Sending the case back to district court, the appeals court\nsaid it agrees with CFIT\u2019s challenge of the terms and award of\ncontracts registering .com domain names, and with CFIT\u2019s claim\nthat there\u2019s a separate market for expiring domain names.  \n A spokeswoman for VeriSign didn\u2019t immediately return a call\nseeking comment.  \n The case is Coalition for ICANN Transparency Inc. v.\nVeriSign, 07-16151, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (San\nFrancisco).  \n Trials/Appeals  \n Glaxo Withheld Avandia Study, Ex-FDA Manager Said to Testify  \n GlaxoSmithKline Plc  withheld from regulators a study\nshowing its Avandia diabetes drug may cause heart attacks, a\nformer U.S. Food and Drug Administration official said,\naccording to two people familiar with her deposition in a\nlawsuit against the drugmaker.  \n Dr. Rosemary Johann-Liang, a former manager in the FDA\u2019s\ndrug-safety unit, told lawyers suing Glaxo that the 2001 study\nfound Avandia posed a greater heart-attack risk than rival\nmedicines, the people said. Glaxo also didn\u2019t turn over an e-\nmail from researchers who concluded Avandia \u201cstrengthens the\nsignals\u201d of heart ailments, she testified in a pre-trial\ndeposition last month, according to the people.  \n Johann-Liang left the FDA in 2007 following her\nrecommendation that London-based Glaxo add more information\nabout health risks to Avandia\u2019s label, the people said. Johann-\nLiang stated that FDA officials provided the drugmaker with\ndetails of internal agency discussions about beefing up the\nwarnings, according to the people, who also said she testified\nthe leaks \u201cshould not have happened\u201d and violated FDA policy.  \n Johann-Liang\u2019s deposition may be considered by an FDA\nadvisory panel meeting this week in Washington to consider\nwhether Avandia\u2019s ability to control blood-sugar levels\noutweighs a possible increase in heart attacks, strokes and\ndeaths from cardiovascular disease, the people said. They\ndeclined to provide a transcript of the testimony.  \n While Glaxo officials contend no studies have proven that\nAvandia is dangerous, drug-safety advocates have called for the\nmedicine\u2019s withdrawal from the market. Actos, a similar diabetes\ndrug sold by Tokyo-based Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., poses less\nof a heart-attack risk, researchers have found. Glaxo withheld a\nstudy on Actos from the FDA, Johann-Liang testified, according\nto the people.  \n Glaxo Mary disputes Johann-Liang\u2019s claims that it didn\u2019t\nturn over a 2001 review of Avandia\u2019s health risks to federal\nregulators, Mary Anne Rhyne, a company spokeswoman, said in an\ne-mailed statement. The company\u2019s study \u201cdetermined that there\nwas no signal of an increased risk for heart attacks associated\nwith Avandia,\u201d Rhyne said. \u201cGSK identified this internal\nreview and described its results in a Periodic Safety Update\nReport that was submitted to the FDA.\u201d Erica Jefferson, a\nspokeswoman for the FDA, declined to comment beyond confirming\nthat Johann-Liang isn\u2019t currently an FDA employee. Johann-Liang\ndidn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.  \n Glaxo faces its first U.S. trial over Avandia in\nPhiladelphia federal court in October, Rhyne said.  \n Avandia was once the world\u2019s best-selling diabetes pill,\ngenerating annual revenue of $3 billion by 2006, including sales\nof a combination pill called Avandamet. Sales plunged after a\nMay 2007 report in the New England Journal of Medicine linked\nthe drug to a 43 percent increased risk of heart attacks. That\nprompted U.S. and European regulators to order Glaxo to\nstrengthen its warnings.  \n The case is In Re Avandia Marketing, Sales Practices and\nProducts Liability Litigation, 07-01871, U.S. District Court,\nEastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).  \n Moody\u2019s, S&P, Fitch Seek to Dismiss Investors\u2019 Negligence Suit  \n Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc. , Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch\nRatings asked a judge July 9 to dismiss a lawsuit filed by two\nCalifornia investors who claim the companies gave inflated\nratings to inferior bonds.  \n Ronald Grassi, a retired California attorney, and his wife,\na retired teacher, sued the New York-based companies over claims\nthey had a conflict of interest in rating  Lehman Brothers\nHoldings Inc.  mortgage-backed bonds. The companies named the\nbonds \u201cinvestment grade\u201d to achieve more sales of their rating\nservices and didn\u2019t downgrade the bonds until Lehman filed for\nbankruptcy in 2008, Grassi said.  \n U.S. Magistrate Judge Dale A. Drozd in Sacramento threw out\nthe case in a March ruling, saying Grassi\u2019s negligence and fraud\nallegations weren\u2019t specific enough. Grassi filed a more\ndetailed complaint in April. A similar case in state court in\nSan Francisco survived the companies\u2019 request for dismissal in\nMay, Grassi said in a filing.  \n \u201cI\u2019m claiming the ratings agencies who spent 60 to 70\nyears becoming the only expert in town convinced everybody that\nthey knew what was going on,\u201d Grassi said in a phone interview.\n\u201cWhen they say \u2018investment grade,\u2019 they\u2019re saying this is a\npretty safe bond; you\u2019ll probably get your money back and\nprobably get your interest payments.\u201d  \n In court documents, the companies claim Grassi failed to\nmake a case that they owed him a \u201cduty of care,\u201d which is\nrequired to support his negligence claim. Grassi\u2019s second\ncomplaint still lacks \u201csubstantive allegations about the\nratings of the Lehman bonds\u201d and doesn\u2019t include allegations\nthat the companies \u201cmade any false statements in connection\nwith the specific bonds at issue in this case,\u201d they said in\ncourt filings. As with similar suits filed in other states, the\ncompanies also argue that credit ratings are statements of\nopinion protected by the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.  \n In January, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s won dismissal of\na lawsuit seeking to hold them responsible for defrauding\ninvestors who bought about $100 billion of mortgage-backed\nsecurities. Connecticut and Ohio also sued the ratings\ncompanies.  \n Fitch is a unit of Paris-based  Fimalac SA  and Moody\u2019s is a\nunit of  Moody\u2019s Corp . Standard & Poor\u2019s is a unit of  McGraw-Hill\nCos.   \n The case is Grassi v. Moody\u2019s, 09-00543, U.S. District\nCourt, Eastern District of California (Sacramento).  \n New Suits  \n Goldman Sachs Sued by Liberty on Fannie Mae Offering  \n Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  was accused in a lawsuit by\nLiberty Mutual Insurance Co. of misleading investors in 2007\nwhen it sold Fannie Mae preferred shares while betting against\nthe U.S. mortgage market.  \n Goldman Sachs misrepresented Fannie Mae\u2019s  health  when it\nunderwrote the offerings, in which the insurer invested $62.5\nmillion, according to a complaint filed July 8 in federal court\nin Boston. The investment bank misstated the purpose of the sale\nby saying the offering was to raise  surplus capital  when it was\nactually needed to help Fannie Mae sustain its business, said\nLiberty Mutual, which accused Goldman Sachs of securities fraud.  \n \u201cAs a knowledgeable and sophisticated investor in the U.S.\nreal estate financial  markets , and with access to Fannie Mae\u2019s\nfinancial records, Goldman Sachs knew or recklessly disregarded\nthe actual status of Fannie Mae\u2019s capital structure,\u201d Liberty\nMutual said in the complaint. The mortgage guarantor was seized\nby the U.S. in 2008.  \n Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman\nSachs, said the suit was without merit \u201cand we will contest it\nvigorously.\u201d  \n Goldman Sachs has come under fire from Congress and\nregulators for its underwriting and investments as mortgage\nmarkets collapsed during the credit crisis. The U.S. Securities\nand Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs in April, claiming it\nsold a collateralized debt obligation without disclosing that a\nhedge fund helped pick underlying securities and bet against the\nvehicles. Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing.  \n At the time that it was underwriting the Fannie Mae\noffering, Goldman was aware that there were \u201csignificant\nproblems\u201d in the real estate market and bet its own money\nagainst subprime-mortgage-related securities, Liberty Mutual\nsaid in the complaint, which drew on documents collected by the\nU.S. Senate\u2019s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.  \n The documents, including internal Goldman Sachs e-mails,\nestablish that during the time leading up to the disputed\nofferings, \u201cGoldman Sachs not only knew about the serious risks\nin the  mortgage market , but it was urgently moving to short the\nmortgage market,\u201d the suit says.  \n Rich Angevine, a spokesman for Liberty Mutual, declined to\ncomment. The Boston-based company is owned by policyholders and\nisn\u2019t publicly traded.  \n The case is Liberty Mutual v. Goldman Sachs, 10-cv-11150,\nU.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston).  \n J&J Sued by Consumers Over Children\u2019s Cold, Allergy Medicines  \n Johnson & Johnson , the world\u2019s largest health-products\ncompany, was sued by U.S. consumers accusing it of fraud and\nracketeering, and demanding cash refunds for recalled children\u2019s\ncold and allergy medicines.  \n In five complaints seeking class-action, or group, status\nfiled July 8 in federal court in Chicago, the consumers spurned\nan offer by J&J\u2019s McNeil Consumer Healthcare and McNeil-PPC Inc.\nunits for refund coupons and demanded  cash .  \n The coupons are \u201cworthless\u201d because McNeil has stopped\nmaking the medicines and \u201cwrongly assumes that all consumers\nwill want to purchase the company\u2019s children\u2019s products at some\nuncertain future date,\u201d according to the  complaints .  \n The companies on April 30 recalled more than 40 types of\npediatric pain and allergy drugs saying their quality and\npotency didn\u2019t meet internal requirements. Among the products it\nnamed were children\u2019s formulations of liquid Tylenol, Motrin and\nBenadryl. J&J\u2019s over-the-counter medicines and nutritionals  unit \nhad  revenue  of $1.21 billion in the first quarter.  \n Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for New Brunswick, New Jersey-\nbased J&J, said consumers can request a refund or coupon at\n mcneilproductrecall.com . She declined to comment further, saying\nthat as a policy the company doesn\u2019t discuss litigation.  \n The complaints say that purchasers who have used up or\nthrown out the drugs without keeping receipts won\u2019t be able to\navail themselves of the company\u2019s recall.  \n The suits seek to proceed on behalf of plaintiffs\u2019 groups\nfor residents of Illinois, Texas and Florida, as well as\nconsumers in the U.S. and Canada, who have bought the drugs\nsince December 2008.  \n The cases are Burrell v. McNeil Consumer Healthcare,\n10cv4252; DeGroot v. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, 10cv4253;\nMichaud v. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, 10cv4254; Nguyen v.\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare, 10cv4255; Roberson v. McNeil\nConsumer Healthcare, 10cv4256, U.S. District Court, Northern\nDistrict of Illinois (Chicago).  \n Verdicts/Settlements  \n Air France-KLM Agrees to $87 Million Cargo Price Settlement  \n Air France-KLM  Group and its Martinair Holland unit agreed\nto pay $87 million to settle class-action lawsuits in the U.S.\naccusing them of fixing prices for air-cargo shipments.  \n The deal, which must be approved by a judge in New York,\nwill resolve claims by companies that purchased shipping\nservices to and from the U.S. by Air France, KLM and Martinair\nbetween 2000 and 2006, the carriers said today in a statement.  \n The cases were filed in 2006 after the U.S. and the\nEuropean Union began probing dozens of companies, leading to a\nseries of settlements, fines and plea agreements by airlines and\nexecutives. Air France, KLM and Martinair reached plea deals in\n2008 to end the U.S. probe. The EU investigation is pending, Air\nFrance said.  \n The probe was disclosed by U.S. and European Union\nofficials in February 2006. The EU issued complaints to 26\nairlines the next year, after what regulators said were the\nlargest coordinated antitrust raids. Regulators in South Korea,\nCanada and Australia have also fined carriers.  \n Cargo airlines often work together to carry freight,\nsetting aside as much as 10 percent of space for partners.\nCarriers\u2019 price structures include surcharges that change\ndepending on factors such as oil prices and security measures.  \n A call to Air France wasn\u2019t immediately returned. EU\nspokeswoman  Amelia Torres  declined to immediately comment on the\nstatus of the probe.  \n Legislation  \n U.K. to Review Defamation Laws, Stem Flow of Libel Tourists  \n The U.K. will review its anti-defamation laws to protect\nfreedom of speech after the nation became the destination of\nchoice for libel cases against journalists, academics and\nscientists.  \n The government plans to propose legislation next year\nfollowing a public consultation, Justice Minister Tom McNally\nsaid July 9.  \n The U.K.\u2019s strongly defined anti-defamation laws have\nencouraged so-called libel tourism where overseas firms and\nindividuals pursue cases through the British courts.  \n \u201cWe want to ensure that the right balance is achieved so\npeople who have been defamed are able to take action to protect\ntheir reputation but so that freedom of speech is not\nunjustifiably impeded,\u201d McNally told lawmakers in the upper\n House of Lords .  \n Peta Buscombe, a Conservative lawmaker and chairman of\nnewspaper watchdog, the Press Complaints Commission, told\nlawmakers during the same debate that changes are \u201coverdue.\u201d  \n Labour Party lawmaker David Triesman, who stood down as\nchairman of the Football Association after a newspaper reported\na private conversation in which he criticized other nations,\nsaid a \u201csavage\u201d  media should not be given greater powers.  \n \u201cI have seen some newspapers, journalists and proprietors\n-- although by no means all of them -- savage people who did not\ndeserve it and had no equal chance of fighting their corner,\u201d\nTriesman said in the same debate on July 9.  \n Changes should be made to the costs of bringing and\ndefending libel actions, which can cost \u201cmillions of pounds,\u201d\nsaid Dan Tench, a partner at Olswang LLP in London.  \n \u201cMany would say the real issue in respect to our libel law\nis to do with the costs,\u201d said Tench. \u201cThere\u2019s not very much\nlibel tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s commonplace, but\nit\u2019s really not.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Ellen Rosen  in New York at \n erosen14@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of GlaxoSmithKline PLC was 18.789352416992188 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of GlaxoSmithKline PLC was ",
