The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  got a boost in\nits fight against a 612 million-euro ($794 million) damage suit\nby the founders of competitor  Telegate AG (TGT) , after a judge voiced\ndoubts on the merits of the case.  Klaus Harisch and Peter Wuensch may not be entitled to\nclaim compensation for the depressive effect that Deutsche\nTelekom\u2019s overcharging for directory data had on Telegate shares\nthey sold, Presiding Judge Rainer Hahn said at a hearing in\nCologne today. The men are claiming damages that would have been\nincurred by the company and not them individually, Hahn said, as\nhe gave his initial view on the case.  \u201cWhat the plaintiff seeks is a mere refection of the\ncompany\u2019s damage\u201d and in such a situation, \u201cthe law doesn\u2019t\nallow them to seek any payments,\u201d said Hahn. \u201cThat\u2019s my\npreliminary view of the issue but I want to stress that this\ncourt will still deliberate and reserves to rule in any way it\nseems fit in the end.\u201d  Deutsche Telekom has fought complaints for years by\ndirectory service providers who said they were being charged too\nmuch for the services and data that  Germany \u2019s former phone\nmonopoly was legally obliged to provide.  The country\u2019s top civil court this year backed two lower\ncourt rulings requiring Deutsche Telekom to pay back a combined\n97.2 million euros in overcharged fees and legal costs.  The Cologne court today also heard another case by Telegate\nseeking an additional 86 million euros in damages. The Munich-\nbased company argues that Deutsche Telekom\u2019s overcharging curbed\nprofits.  Hahn told Telegate\u2019s lawyers they have to show their\nbusiness plans from the time the alleged lost profits were\nincurred.  \u2018Wishful Thinking\u2019  \u201cLost profits may not consist of wishful thinking only,\u201d\nsaid Hahn. The court scheduled a ruling for April 16.  Georg Jochum, a lawyer for Telegate and the two founders,\nsaid the court has taken a debatable view of the law. The case\nmay end up in German\u2019s top civil court unless Hahn and his two\ncolleagues change their minds, he said after the hearing.  Deutsche Telekom lawyer Joachim Schuetze told the court\nTelegate tries to \u201cdress up the figures\u201d by claiming it would\nhave made more money. He asked the court to dismiss the cases.  Telegate is majority owned by  Italy \u2019s  Seat Pagine Gialle\nSpA. (PG)   Today\u2019s cases are LG Koeln, 87 O 7/06 and 87 O 8/06.
