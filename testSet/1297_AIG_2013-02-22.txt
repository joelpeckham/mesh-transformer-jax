 "context": "The following article called 'AIG Jumps on Surprise Operating Profit as Investments Gain' was published on 2013-02-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmerican International Group Inc. (AIG) ,\nthe insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout, gained in early trading\nas fourth-quarter results beat analysts\u2019 estimates after\ninvestments drove a surprise operating profit.  AIG jumped 3.8 percent to $38.70 at 7:40 a.m. in New York.\nOperating profit was 20 cents a share, beating the average\n estimate  for a loss of 8 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 17\nanalysts. The net loss was $3.96 billion, driven by claims from\nsuperstorm Sandy and costs tied to a deal to sell the plane-\nleasing unit, New York-based AIG said yesterday in a statement.  The operating profit was \u201cdriven primarily by better-than-\nforecasted capital-markets\u201d and other investment results,  Randy Binner , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said in a note.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , 68, has struck\ndeals to sell units including non-U.S. life insurers to simplify\nthe company and help repay the government. He reached an\nagreement in December to sell at least 80 percent of the\nInternational Lease Finance Corp. plane business to a group of\nChinese investors.  AIG  surged  36 percent in 12 months through yesterday in\nregular trading as the U.S. sold its stake. Taxpayers owned as\nmuch as 92 percent of AIG during a bailout that began in 2008\nand swelled to $182.3 billion. AIG sold more than $70 billion of\nassets such as Asian insurers and a U.S. consumer lender to help\nrepay the rescue, which ended in December.  \u2018New Era\u2019  \u201cWhen history is written, we will look back and see that\nby the end of 2012, a new era for AIG had begun,\u201d Benmosche\nsaid in the statement.  Operating profit at the life unit climbed to $1.09 billion\nfrom $912 million a year earlier as investment income rose about\n15 percent.  So-called  alternative investments  generated a gain of $617\nmillion, compared with a loss of $86 million a year earlier, AIG\nsaid in a supplemental filing. Income from private equity surged\nto $454 million from $10 million and hedge funds added $163\nmillion, compared with a loss of $96 million a year earlier.  AIG had $18.9 billion of alternative investments as of Dec.\n31, down from $19.3 billion on Sept. 30. Returns for hedge-fund\nand private-equity investments are reported on a one-month and\none-quarter lag, respectively.  Net unrealized gains on bonds available for sale widened to\n$23.8 billion from $23.2 billion three months earlier. The\nfigures, reflecting market fluctuations that aren\u2019t counted\ntoward earnings, are monitored by investors and rating firms as\na gauge of financial strength.  Claims Costs  The insurer booked a tax benefit in the year-earlier\nperiod, when net income was $21.5 billion. That result was tied\nto a projection that AIG would generate enough operating profit\nto use the tax assets, which are linked to prior losses and can\nlimit future payments to the government.  Full-year profit was $3.44 billion, compared with $20.6\nbillion a year earlier.  The property-casualty unit, led by  Peter Hancock , posted a\nfourth-quarter pretax loss of $983 million, compared with a\nprofit of $817 million a year earlier, as the company faced\nclaims from Sandy. The business that was known as Chartis spent\n$1.25 on claims and expenses for every premium dollar it\ncollected, compared with spending $1.07 a year earlier.  Sandy cost AIG about $1.3 billion after tax. The storm\nstruck the U.S. Northeast in October and cut profit at insurers\nincluding Travelers Cos., Chubb Corp., and Allstate Corp.\nTravelers, the lone insurer in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average ,\nreported $689 million of catastrophe costs in the fourth\nquarter, led by Sandy.  Premium Revenue  Premium revenue at AIG\u2019s property-casualty unit slipped 3.9\npercent to $8.61 billion. Premiums, deposits and other\nconsiderations at the life unit fell 11 percent to $5.22 billion\nfrom a year earlier on a decline in fixed-annuity deposits,\ndriven by low  interest rates .  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities,\ndecreased to $66.38 a share as of Dec. 31 from $68.87 three\nmonths earlier. There was a $4.4 billion charge tied to\ndiscontinued operations, fueled by ILFC, the insurer said. AIG\nsaid it was more selective about taking on risk.  The loss at the mortgage-insurance business widened to $45\nmillion from $25 million a year earlier. Longer foreclosure\nprocesses in some states pushed he company to increase reserves\nfor losses on first-liens. Mortgage insurers pay lenders when\nhomeowners default and foreclosures fail to recoup costs.  AIG reported having  63,000 employees , compared with 57,000\na year earlier. The increase was mostly the result of a decision\nto count agents who previously weren\u2019t classified as full-time\nemployees, Jim Ankner, an AIG spokesman, wrote in an e-mail\nbefore results were released. Some employees were added as AIG\nacquired broker-dealer Woodbury Financial Services from Hartford\nFinancial Services Group Inc., Ankner said.  AIG reported a staff of about 116,000 at the end of 2008.
