That helped push\ncopper to a record as global equities climbed to the highest\nlevel in more than two years. Gold has been supported by\nspreading Middle East political unrest and as the dollar slipped\nto an almost three-month low against the euro.  Manufacturing data \u201chas led to greater optimism over the\nglobal economy, putting further downward pressure on gold,\u201d\nMarc Ground, an analyst at Standard Bank Plc, wrote in a report.\n\u201cGiven the tide of risk appetite, as evident by a strong\nshowing of equities, we think that gold will continue to\nstruggle to break through $1,350 an ounce. The only real support\nis coming from a weaker dollar and concerns regarding global\ninflation.\u201d  Gold futures for April delivery lost $2.90, or 0.2 percent,\nto $1,337.40 an ounce at 7:55 a.m. on the Comex in New York.

Gold futures reached\na record $1,432.50 on Dec. 7.  \u2018Risk Appetite Improved\u2019  The manufacturing data removed \u201csome of gold\u2019s safe-haven\nappeal as risk appetite improved,\u201d  Mark Pervan , head of\ncommodity research at  Australia  and New Zealand Banking Group\nLtd., wrote in a daily report today. Political tensions in the\nMiddle East \u201ccould be supportive\u201d for gold, he said.

In Jordan,  King Abdullah  replaced his prime minister following street\nprotests, and Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh said today he\nwon\u2019t seek to extend his term when it expires in 2013.
