 "context": "The following article called 'Sprint Reports Profit as Fewer Users Leave Than Projected' was published on 2013-10-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSprint Corp. (S) , the third-largest U.S.\nwireless carrier, reported a third-quarter profit as fewer\nsubscribers departed than analysts had estimated.  The company lost 360,000 contract subscribers, compared\nwith the average estimate of 371,000, according to eight\nanalysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company expects to gain\nsubscribers in the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Joe Euteneuer said today on a conference call.  Sprint, which was acquired by  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  in July for\n$21.6 billion, closed down its outdated Nextel network on June\n30, losing some subscribers to other carriers in the process.\nThe Overland Park, Kansas-based company said it sold almost 1.4\nmillion of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhones.  \u201cYou have to wonder when Sprint will get aggressive on\npushing subscriber growth,\u201d said Kevin Roe, an analyst with Roe\nEquity Research based in Dorset,  Vermont . \u201cI believe Sprint\nwill ramp up their marketing and promotions this quarter and\nthrough the first half of 2014.\u201d  An increase in the value of an investment in Clearwire\nCorp. helped Sprint record net income of $383 million, compared\nwith a loss of $767 million a year earlier, the company said\ntoday in a statement.  Sprint rose 3.7 percent to $6.93 at the close in New York.\nThe shares have gained 25 percent since the SoftBank acquisition\nclosed in July.  Third-quarter revenue was $8.68 billion, below the $8.78\nbillion average estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The\naverage Sprint contract user\u2019s phone bill was $64.28, an\nincrease from $64.20 in the second quarter. Analysts projected\n$62.13 on average.  Clearwire Gain  The company recorded a one-time after-tax gain of $1.4\nbillion to reflect the higher value of its shares of Clearwire,\nwhich rose as Sprint competed with  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  for\ncontrol of the wireless-Internet company. Sprint eventually won\nthat battle with a $3.9 billion transaction, completing the\nacquisition on July 9.  Sprint\u2019s third-quarter operating loss widened to $398\nmillion from $231 million a year earlier.  Sprint is spending about $16 billion over two years on\nnetwork upgrades to catch up to  AT&T Inc. (T)  and Verizon Wireless\nin fourth-generation long-term evolution, or LTE, coverage. LTE\ndelivers fast Internet access allowing users to stream video and\ndownload music.  The company is introducing a service called Sprint Spark to\ndeliver faster download speeds in about 100 cities over the next\nthree years, it said today.  \u2018Tough Transition\u2019  T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS) , which has been attracting customers with\ncheaper plans and no-contract service agreements, is neck-and-neck with Sprint in cities covered with LTE service.  \u201cThey are still in a tough transition as they work to\nupgrade their network,\u201d James Moorman, an analyst with S&P\nCapital IQ in New York, said of Sprint. \u201cUntil their network is\nmore comparable to the bigger carriers, they will have a problem\nwith customer churn.\u201d  Last month, in response to T-Mobile and the other carriers,\nSprint gave customers an option to upgrade their phones more\noften. The Sprint One Up plan lets users get a new phone every\n12 months, imitating similar offers like Jump from T-Mobile,\nwhich lets customers upgrade twice a year for an extra $10 a\nmonth.  Earlier this month, in the first management shake-up under\nnew owner SoftBank, Sprint reorganized its sales organization,\nincluded the exit of Chief Sales Officer Paget Alves and Chief\nMarketing Officer Bill Malloy.  While expectations are low for Sprint this year, the\noutlook may improve as the company starts to use airwaves\nacquired from Clearwire Corp. to improve network quality,\ncompeting with the top carriers on performance,  Jennifer\nFritzsche , a Wells Fargo analyst, wrote in a note earlier this\nweek.  \u201cSpectrum could be Sprint\u2019s secret sauce,\u2019\u201d Fritzsche\nwrote. \u201cIn our view, the \u2018new\u2019 Sprint\u2019s strategy will be all\naround network speed and throughput.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nScott Moritz in New York at \n smoritz6@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nNick Turner at \n nturner7@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of DISH Network Corporation was 48.43000030517578 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of DISH Network Corporation was ",
