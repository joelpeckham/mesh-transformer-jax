The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the biggest\nmobile phone operator in  New Zealand , agreed to buy  Telstra\nCorp. (TLS) \u2019s local unit for NZ$840 million ($668 million) as it\nchallenges fixed-line leader Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd.  The agreement includes TelstraClear Ltd.\u2019s voice and data\nservices, network infrastructure and customers in New Zealand,\nMelbourne-based Telstra said today in a statement. The cash\npurchase is expected to close before the end of the year subject\nto regulatory approval, Vodafone said in an e-mailed statement.  Vodafone, which is seeking to win customers as the nation\nexpands high-speed Internet services with a new fiber network,\nis paying about 6.3 times TelstraClear\u2019s total earnings before\ninterest, tax, depreciation and amortization in the year ended\nJune 2011. That compares with the 5-times-earnings average of 68\ndeals for integrated phone companies announced in the past five\nyears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cThe deal premium paid for TelstraClear highlights the\nimportance of this asset to Vodafone New Zealand,\u201d Justin Diddams, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Sydney, said in a\nreport today. \u201cWe see Telecom New Zealand facing increased\ncompetition from Vodafone,\u201d wrote Diddams, who has neutral\nratings on Telstra and Telecom.  TelstraClear has about 16 percent of the fixed-line\nresidential Internet market, while Vodafone has a 13 percent\nshare, with both companies trailing the 49 percent held by\nTelecom Corp., according to Citigroup.  Newbury, England-based Vodafone approached the Australian\ncompany about a potential sale of the unit, Telstra said last\nmonth.  Number Two  \u201cWe see these businesses as very complementary,\u201d Russell Stanners, chief executive officer at Vodafone New Zealand, said\non a conference call today. \u201cWhat you see is the leader in\nmobile teaming up with the clear number two in fixed.\u201d  TelstraClear had sales of A$516 million ($525 million) in\nthe 12 months ended June 2011, with earnings before interest,\ntax, depreciation and amortization of A$84 million. On a\nvaluation that excludes TelstraClear\u2019s inter-company\ntransactions, Vodafone is paying 7.8 times Ebitda.  Telstra shares fell 0.3 percent to A$3.85 at the close of\ntrading in Sydney, trimming their gain this year to 16 percent.\nTelecom gained 2.2 percent to NZ$2.58 at the close of Wellington\ntrading. Vodafone shares droppped as much as 1.8 percent and\nwere down 1.3 percent as of 12.45 p.m. in London  Telstra Charges  Auckland-based Telecom said it\u2019s \u201cwell positioned\u201d to\ngrow, even if rivals combine.  \u201cTelecom New Zealand is in an extremely strong position to\ncompete no matter if this acquisition goes through or not,\u201d\nActing Chief Executive Officer Chris Quin said in a statement.  Telstra is exiting New Zealand as it focuses on winning\nmobile and Internet customers in its home market.  \u201cThe transaction is consistent with Telstra\u2019s overall\nstrategy and capital management framework,\u201d Telstra CEO David Thodey said in the statement.  Telstra will return about NZ$490 million in cash to\n Australia  via a dividend before the deal is completed.  As part of the transaction, Telstra agreed with Vodafone\nNew Zealand to ensure service continuity for its customers, the\nAustralian company said.  TelstraClear was formed when Telstra bought  British\nTelecommunications Plc (BT/A) \u2019s New Zealand unit, Clear Communications\nLtd., in 2001.  Separately, Telstra will take impairments of about A$130\nmillion each in the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years because of\nunrealized currency losses, it said in the statement.
