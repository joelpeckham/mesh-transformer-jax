 "context": "The following article called 'European Insurers May See \u2018Golden Year\u2019 as Disasters Push Prices' was published on 2012-04-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEurope \u2019s biggest insurers and\nreinsurers, including  Allianz SE (ALV)  and  Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN) ,\nare using last year\u2019s losses from natural catastrophes and auto\nunderwriting to increase policy prices.  Allianz, Europe\u2019s biggest insurer, expects higher profit\nthis year, helped by the \u201chigh single-digit price increase\u201d it\nsecured for German motor insurance in 2011. Zurich Insurance,\n Switzerland \u2019s biggest insurer, reported that general insurance\nrates rose by more than 3 percent last year.  The record $105 billion of natural disaster claims that\ndepressed earnings last year may give insurers and reinsurers\nthat help them shoulder risks for clients the leverage to push\nthrough property and casualty price increases. That will help\ncounter the effect of low  interest rates , which are crimping\ninvestment returns. Yields on German 10-year bunds fell close to\nan all-time low this month.  \u201c2012 could become a golden year for insurers and\nreinsurers off the back of last year\u2019s high claims,\u201d said\nMichael Haid, an equity analyst at MainFirst Group in Frankfurt.\n\u201cInsurers and reinsurers need to show they can push through\nprice increases if they want to assure investors they can\nsucceed in the low interest rate environment.\u201d  Net income at Munich-based Allianz may double to 5.29\nbillion euros ($7 billion) this year, according to the mean\nestimate of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Only two of the\n39 analysts who rated the stock in 2012 have sell ratings while\n23 say buy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Steady Process  Profit at Zurich Insurance, which had major catastrophe\nlosses of $1 billion last year, is expected to climb 12 percent\nto $4.22 billion, according to analysts, who have 10 times more\nbuy than sell ratings on the shares.  \u201cPrice increases that were pushed through last year will\nhelp net income this year,\u201d said Stefan Schuermann, a Zurich-\nbased analyst with Vontobel Holding AG. \u201cPrice increases are\nlikely to continue in many markets, which is a slow, steady\nprocess.\u201d  The 28-company Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index climbed\n9.8 percent this year, led by  Swiss Re AG (SREN)  and Munich Re with\ngains of 23 percent and 21 percent respectively. Allianz rose\nalmost 15 percent and Zurich Insurance 13 percent. The index\ndeclined more than 13 percent in 2011.  Global property insurance rates \u201ccontinued to firm\u201d in\nthe first three months of the year, underpinned by last year\u2019s\ncatastrophe losses,  Marsh & McLennan Cos. (MMC) , the world\u2019s second-\nbiggest insurance broker, said in a  report  this month.  \u2018Solid Growth\u2019  Allianz is seeing \u201cfavorable price effects in several\nmarkets\u201d and expects \u201csolid growth\u201d in its property-casualty\nsegment, Chief Executive Officer Michael Diekmann said last\nmonth in the Munich-based insurer\u2019s annual report. The company\naims to boost operating profit by as much as 11 percent this\nyear.  In motor insurance,  Germany \u2019s biggest segment of P&C\ncoverage, premium income climbed 3.5 percent to 20.9 billion\neuros last year as the average policy price rose for the first\ntime since 2004, the  GDV  industry association said on April 18.\nMotor insurance rates are still at a level comparable to the\nbeginning of the 1980s, the association said.  Insurers are trying to cut costs and boost prices amid\nslowing economic growth and market turmoil, said Axel Lehmann,\nchief risk officer at Zurich Insurance.  Changing Times  \u201cSince the end of the Second World War we have had\ncontinuous growth, but these times are changing,\u201d Lehmann said\nin an interview. \u201cTo overcome declining investment income\ninsurers need to cut costs, improve their underwriting and focus\non risk-adjusted prices.\u201d  Reinsurance rates rose in April 1 renewals, which focus on\nthe Asia Pacific region, after last year\u2019s losses from\nearthquakes and floods in  Japan ,  Thailand  and  New Zealand ,\nMarsh\u2019s reinsurance broker Guy Carpenter & Co. said on April 5.\nAbout two-thirds of annual property and casualty reinsurance\ncontracts typically come up for renewal in January, with the\nremainder renewed in April and July.  Munich Re , the world\u2019s biggest reinsurer, expects more\nprice increases this year, particularly in loss-affected\nregions. The firm\u2019s aggregate losses from natural catastrophes\nalmost tripled to 4.5 billion euros last year.  Primary property and casualty \u201cprices are starting to\nrise, but are not yet enough to compensate for the interest rate\ndecline,\u201d Swiss Re, the world\u2019s second-ranked reinsurer, said\non April 17. Pricing trends are on an \u201cimproving track,\u201d\naccording to  George Quinn , chief financial officer at Swiss Re,\nwhich had about $3.48 billion of large natural catastrophe\nclaims in 2011.  Catastrophe Looms  While Aon Benfield estimates that natural disasters caused\nless than $3 billion of insured losses in the first quarter,\ncompared with almost $53 billion in the year-earlier period,\nthey remain a threat to earnings forecasts, said  Christian Muschick , an analyst with Silvia Quandt Research in  Frankfurt .\nThe  Atlantic hurricane season  starts on June 1 and runs through\nthe end of November.  \u201cWhatever happens on the pricing front will be\novershadowed by the magnitude of catastrophe claims,\u201d said\nMuschick. \u201cOne major hurricane hitting the U.S. could knock\ndown earnings in one swift blow. Higher prices surely won\u2019t be\nable to counter that.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nOliver Suess in Munich at \n osuess@bloomberg.net ;\nCarolyn Bandel in Zurich at \n cbandel@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nFrank Connelly at   fconnelly@bloomberg.net ;\nEdward Evans at   eevans3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. was 26.732892990112305 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. was ",
