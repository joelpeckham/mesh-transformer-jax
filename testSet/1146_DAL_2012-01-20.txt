 "context": "The following article called 'US Airways Said to Consider American Airlines Merger to Fill Revenue Gap' was published on 2012-01-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUS Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  is studying a\npotential merger with bankrupt  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  that would fix a weak\ndomestic route system at  American Airlines  and boost revenue,\ntwo people familiar with the matter said.  President Scott Kirby is leading US Airways\u2019 analysis of\nhow to combine the airlines, said the people, who asked not to\nbe identified because the matter is private. Any bid may still\nbe close to a year away, because AMR now holds the exclusive\nright to file a reorganization plan, the people said.  American has pared its flight network to the point that\nsome corporate travelers have gone elsewhere, leaving the money-\nlosing carrier unable to support most of its hub airports, one\nperson said. That deficiency could be solved by blending\nAmerican, the third-largest U.S. airline, with No. 5 US Airways,\nthe people said.  \u201cUnsecured creditors would get a better return out of a\nmerged airline than American trying to go it alone,\u201d said Jeff Straebler, an independent airline analyst based in Stamford,\n Connecticut .  The combination would hold about a 20 percent domestic\nmarket share, basically putting it on equal footing with United\nContinental Holdings Inc.,  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and  Southwest\nAirlines Co. (LUV) , Straebler said in an interview. Those carriers\nrank first, second and fourth in the U.S. by traffic.  Evolving Plan  A merger attempt is likely, though Tempe, Arizona-based US\nAirways is still weighing options, the people said. The shape of\nany plan would evolve as Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR settles\nissues such as pensions and labor contracts in court, one person\nsaid.  Traffic to American\u2019s hubs would grow by funneling in\ntravelers from US Airways, the person said. In turn, a stronger\ndomestic system would feed into American\u2019s routes across the\nAtlantic and to Latin America, said the person, who declined to\ngive financial details because the numbers are preliminary.  A US Airways spokeswoman, Michelle Mohr, declined to\ncomment, as did  Sean Collins , an American spokesman.  TPG Capital and Delta also are evaluating possible bids for\nAmerican, people familiar with the matter have said. TPG and\nDelta have said they aren\u2019t commenting about any interest in\nAMR, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in  U.S. Bankruptcy\nCourt  in  Manhattan  on Nov. 29 after posting annual losses\nstarting in 2008.  No Contacts  US Airways hasn\u2019t discussed its interest with AMR\u2019s\nexecutives, one person said. Nor has it spoken with TPG about\nAmerican, the person said.  TPG founder David Bonderman led a group that invested more\nthan $200 million in America West Airlines Inc. as it exited\nbankruptcy in 1994, taking a 33.5 percent stake and controlling\na majority of its board. That carrier later became America West\nHoldings Corp., a  US Airways  predecessor.  US Airways rose 1.9 percent to $6.38 at the close in  New\nYork . AMR\u2019s 8.625 percent notes due in October 2021 fell 0.25\ncent to 106.5 cents on the dollar at 3:26 p.m., according to\nTrace, the bond-pricing service of the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority.  US Airways has been the airline most often cited by\nanalysts as a potential American partner. It has hired Millstein\n& Co. and Barclays Plc as advisers, according to people familiar\nwith the matter. The airline hasn\u2019t confirmed the arrangement.  Three Survivors  A tie-up with American would shrink the U.S. industry to\nthree major full-service carriers, increasing the survivors\u2019\npower to raise fares. It would surpass Delta as the second-\nbiggest U.S. airline and fulfill US Airways Chief Executive\nOfficer Doug Parker\u2019s call for industry consolidation.  The current US Airways was created in 2005 when Parker,\nthen CEO of  America West Holdings (AWA) , orchestrated a merger to\nbring the old US Airways out of bankruptcy. He failed in three\nadditional merger attempts since 2006, including a hostile bid\nfor Delta when that company was in Chapter 11.  American\u2019s passenger revenue for each seat flown a mile, an\nindustry benchmark, trailed that of US Airways, United\nContinental and Delta through 2011\u2019s first three quarters,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  American\u2019s hubs include Dallas- Fort Worth , Miami, New York\nand  Chicago , while US Airways has major operations in cities\nsuch as  Charlotte ,  North Carolina ; Philadelphia; and Phoenix.
