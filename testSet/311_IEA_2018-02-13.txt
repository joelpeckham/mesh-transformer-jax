Last week's volatile trading had seen major indexes record some of their biggest one-day falls.\nThe private American Petroleum Institute is due to publish crude inventory estimates on Tuesday, while the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration releases fuel storage and crude production data on Wednesday.\n\"The much-watched U.S. inventory levels are set to increase seasonally over the coming weeks as refineries go into maintenance,\" Julius Baer's head of macro and commodity research, Norbert Ruecker, said.\n\"This should challenge the still-prevalent market tightening narrative at least temporarily. We see more downside for oil prices and stick to our short position.\"\nIn an effort to tighten markets and prop up prices, OPEC and other producers including Russia have been withholding supplies since 2017. The cuts are scheduled to last through 2018.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Dale Hudson)\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. was 9.994999885559082 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. was ",
