The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBarnes & Noble Inc. (BKS)  founder  Leonard Riggio \u2019s $29 million settlement of investors\u2019 claims that he\nwrongfully pushed the biggest U.S. bookstore chain to acquire\nhis college-textbook firm won a judge\u2019s approval.  The agreement by Riggio, who is also New York-based Barnes\n& Noble\u2019s chairman, to give up payments due him as part of the\n$596 million buyout of the textbook seller was a reasonable\nresolution of claims the he reaped excessive benefits from the\n2009 acquisition, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Leo Strine\nconcluded.  \u201cThe only reason this got done was the plaintiffs\u2019 time\nand effort,\u201d Strine said today at hearing in Wilmington.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  agreed this year to invest $300 million in\na new Barnes & Noble unit set up to combine its  Nook  digital\nreader with the college-textbook business. Microsoft will own\nabout 18 percent of the unit, company officials said.  Barnes & Noble, the second-biggest U.S. seller of\nelectronic books, fell last month after officials said sales of\nthe Nook dropped for a second straight quarter.  The settlement, which will be paid personally by Riggio and\nwon\u2019t be covered by insurance covering Barnes & Noble officers\nand directors, came less than a week before Strine was slated to\nhear investors\u2019 claims over the buyout in June.  Promissory Note  Under the terms of the settlement, Riggio will forgo\n$22.75 million in payments he was to receive under a\n$150 million promissory note Barnes & Noble issued as part of\nthe purchase of  Barnes & Noble College Booksellers Inc.   Riggio also will cut $6.3 million in interest payments due\non the note, which matures in 2014, according to court filings\noutlining the settlement.  Shareholders\u2019 lawyers argued that the board allowed Riggio\nto dictate terms and timing of the buyout and didn\u2019t force him\nto seek other offers for the company to justify the price.  Both sides were gearing up for trial in June when they were\nable to reach the $29 million settlement, Pam Tikellis, a\nWilmington-based lawyer for Barnes & Noble shareholders, told\nStrine today.  \u201cThis was a hard-fought case where nothing was easy,\u201d\nTikellis said. The lawyer and her colleagues asked Strine in\ncourt filings to award them more than $11 million in fees and\ncosts for their work in the Barnes & Noble suit.  $7 Million  The judge cut the total award to $7 million for fees and\ncosts after Barnes & Noble officials objected to the $11 million\nrequest, saying the final figure provided \u201creasonable reward\u201d\nfor the plaintiffs\u2019 efforts.  Because the investors filed their suits as so-called\nderivative actions, the settlement -- minus legal fees and costs\n-- will be returned to the company\u2019s coffers rather than to\nindividual shareholders.  Mary Ellen Keating , a Barnes & Noble spokeswoman, declined\nin an e-mailed statement today to comment on Strine\u2019s approval\nof the settlement.  Barnes & Noble sells the second-most e-books in the U.S.\nafter  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  It was the target of a takeover bid by\nbillionaire  John Malone \u2019s  Liberty Media Corp. (LMCA)  last year. Liberty\ninvested $204 million in the company after dropping its bid.  Barnes & Noble also fended off a bid by billionaire\ninvestor  Ron Burkle  to invalidate its anti-takeover defenses and\nclear the way for a proxy fight over board seats in 2010. Strine\nconcluded the chain\u2019s so-called poison-pill defense didn\u2019t\nunfairly hamper Burkle\u2019s effort to have his designees elected as\ndirectors.
