 "context": "The following article called 'UBS, JPMorgan, MBIA, AIG, RBS, Lehman in Court News' was published on 2010-12-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThree former  UBS AG  executives who\npleaded guilty or were sentenced in U.S. courts over a 24-hour\nperiod put the largest Swiss bank in a different light than its\n website  touting the skill and professionalism of its bankers.  Yesterday and the day before, one banker pleaded guilty and\nanother was sentenced in separate cases involving insider\ntrading while a third pleaded guilty in a tax case. A fourth\nman, an ex-UBS client, admitted yesterday to hiding his Swiss\nbank account from U.S. tax authorities. Zurich-based UBS\nadmitted last year that it helped thousands of Americans evade\ntaxes, avoided U.S. prosecution by paying $780 million and gave\nthe Internal Revenue Service data on accounts.  Igor Poteroba, 37, pleaded guilty to one count of\nconspiracy to commit securities fraud and three counts of\nsecurities fraud on Dec. 21 before U.S. District Judge Paul A.\nCrotty in Manhattan, according to court records. He was accused\nof tipping friends to potential mergers and has agreed to\nforfeit $465,000 in proceeds from the crime.  Nicos Stephanou will serve no more prison time after\ntestifying for prosecutors at an unrelated insider-trading\ntrial. He was sentenced yesterday in federal court in New York\nafter spending 19 months in custody after his arrest. Freed in\nAugust, he was the government\u2019s star witness in the trial of\nJoseph Contorinis, a former money manager at  Jefferies Paragon\nFund  who was convicted in October in an insider-trading scheme\nthat prosecutors said netted more than $7 million in illegal\nprofits.  In a third case, former UBS banker Renzo Gadola pleaded\nguilty to helping wealthy American clients hide assets from the\nInternal Revenue Service.  Gadola, 44, yesterday admitted conspiring with a Swiss\nbanker to encourage U.S. clients who hadn\u2019t told the IRS about\ntheir UBS accounts to open undeclared ones at Basler\nKantonalbank. Gadola, who is cooperating with prosecutors,\nentered his plea in federal court in Miami.  The unidentified banker and Gadola told clients not to join\na partial amnesty program that led 18,000 Americans to disclose\noffshore accounts to the IRS, prosecutors said. Gadola and the\nbanker told U.S. clients \u201cnot to disclose their undeclared\naccounts at Basler Kantonalbank and other banks to the United\nStates government,\u201d according to court filings.  A former UBS client, Ernest Vogliano, pleaded guilty to six\nfederal tax charges for hiding about $1.8 million in a Swiss\nbank account from the IRS.  Vogliano, who lives in New York, was among seven one-time\nUBS clients who were arrested or whose guilty pleas were\nannounced in April. Vogliano entered his plea yesterday in\nfederal court in Manhattan.  The Poteroba case is U.S. v. Poteroba, 10-mag-00562, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan); The\nStephanou case is U.S. v.

JPMorgan to Pay Florida $25 Million for Securities Sales  JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  the second-biggest U.S. bank by\nassets, agreed to pay Florida $25 million to settle allegations\nit sold unregistered securities to a state-run municipal money-\nmarket fund that suffered a run on deposits because it held\ndefaulted debt.  Participants in Florida\u2019s Local Government Investment Pool\nwill get $23 million of the settlement to reimburse them for\nlosses in 2007 on asset-backed securities, some of which were\nsold by JPMorgan to the fund\u2019s overseer, the State Board of\nAdministration, Attorney General Bill McCollum said yesterday in\na  statement . The rest will pay fines and related costs, he said.  \u201cThis settlement is part of the state\u2019s continued efforts\nto secure the maximum valuation of investment securities held by\nthe SBA,\u201d McCollum said from Tallahassee, the capital.  Assets in what was once the largest U.S. manager of\nmunicipal cash plunged from $27 billion in November 2007 to\nabout  $6.9 billion  this week after it said that it held\ndefaulted mortgage-backed bonds. A rush by municipalities to\npull out money forced the fund to freeze withdrawals, leaving\nsome communities without cash to pay workers and other costs.  The fund, since renamed  Florida Prime , was reorganized to\nsegregate the defaulted securities under a plan from New York-\nbased  BlackRock Inc. , the biggest publicly traded U.S. money\nmanager. The best-quality securities were set aside as Fund A\nand resumed paying withdrawals.  \u201cThe settlement is a fair, reasonable and a responsible\nresult for the participants,\u201d Ash Williams, the state board\u2019s\nexecutive director, said in the statement from McCollum.  McCollum said the New York-based bank\u2019s JPMorgan Securities\nLLC unit had violated Florida law by selling unregistered bonds\nto the fund.  JPMorgan \u201cdesires to resolve this matter to avoid the\nburden and cost of any litigation, and accordingly does not\nadmit or deny\u201d the findings of Florida\u2019s investigation, the\ncompany said in the settlement agreement.  \u201cWe are pleased that both parties can now move past this\nissue and we look forward to continuing our service to the state\nof Florida,\u201d JPMorgan said in a statement e-mailed from the\noffice of its spokesman, Joe Evangelisti, in New York.  ICAP Fails to Force Ex-Brokers to Boost Compensation  ICAP Plc , the world\u2019s biggest broker of trades between\nbanks, lost a bid to force two former employees to pay a further\nHK$32.9 million ($4.2 million) in compensation for resigning\nwith immediate effect.  Former Hong Kong equity desk head Elaine Chan and deputy\nPaul Kwok don\u2019t have to pay ICAP funds equivalent to the bonuses\nthey would have earned had they stayed, Hong Kong Court of First\nInstance Judge Arjan Sakhrani ruled yesterday.  Chan and Kwok quit in November 2006 to join Nittan Capital\nAsia Ltd. and paid ICAP a combined HK$5 million in lieu of\nworking their notice period to January 2008. Sakhrani said ICAP\ncouldn\u2019t be paid what the workers may have earned in bonuses,\nwhich can\u2019t be considered wages.  \u201cWe are reserving our position with respect to an\nappeal,\u201d said London-based ICAP\u2019s spokesman Mike Sheard in an\ne-mailed statement.  ICAP\u2019s Hong Kong unit said the bonuses would have been the\nsame as they earned a year earlier: HK$19.5 million for Chan and\nHK$13.4 million for Kwok.  \u201cI am happy with the result and am glad this episode is\nover after more than three years,\u201d Chan said by e-mail\nyesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move on.\u201d  The case is ICAP (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Elaine Chan and Kwok\nChi Leung, CA636&637/2007, Hong Kong Court of First Instance.

New Suits  Martek Biosciences Option Buyers Accused of Inside Trades  Unknown buyers of  Martek Biosciences Corp.  options were\nsued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims\nthey traded on inside information of  Royal DSM NV \u2019s acquisition\nof the company.  The SEC said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal\ncourt in Manhattan that the unknown purchasers used an anonymous\nUBS AG account to buy 2,615 call options on Martek stock from\nDec. 10 to Dec. 15 and then sold the options on Dec. 21, the\nsame day the acquisition was announced. Martek, based in\nColumbia, Maryland, develops products made from microalgae.  \u201cAs a result, the unknown purchasers are in a position to\nrealize total profits of approximately $1.2 million from the\nsale of call options,\u201d the agency said in its complaint.  Royal DSM , a chemical company based in Heerlen,\nNetherlands, said it would pay $1 billion, or $31.50 a share,\nfor all outstanding Martek common stock, a 35 percent premium\nover the previous day\u2019s closing price, according to the SEC. The\nSEC said there was no publicly available information about the\nMartek acquisition before it was announced.  The SEC is seeking an order blocking the buyers from\nviolating U.S. securities law and requiring them to turn over\nthe profits and pay civil fines.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. One or\nMore Unknown Purchasers of Securities of Martek Biosciences\nCorp., 10-cv-09527, U.S. District Court, Southern District of\nNew York (Manhattan).  Bloomberg Sues ECB to Force Disclosure of Greece Swaps  Bloomberg News filed a lawsuit against the European Central\nBank, seeking the disclosure of documents showing how Greece\nused derivatives to hide its fiscal deficit and helped trigger\nthe region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis.  The lawsuit asks the European Union\u2019s General Court in\nLuxembourg to overturn a decision by the ECB not to disclose two\ninternal documents drafted for the central bank\u2019s six-member\nexecutive board in Frankfurt this year. The notes show how\nGreece used swaps to hide its borrowings, according to a March 3\ncover page attached to the papers obtained by Bloomberg News.  ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet withheld the documents\nafter the EU and International Monetary Fund led a 110 billion-\neuro bailout ($144 billion) for Greece. The dossier should be\ndisclosed to stop governments from employing the derivatives in\na similar way again and to show how EU authorities acted on\ninformation they had on the swaps, according to the suit, filed\nby Bloomberg Finance LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.  The EU is dependent \u201con member states taking an open and\ntransparent approach in relation to their levels of debt,\u201d\nBloomberg said in its suit. \u201cIf Greece has failed to take such\nan approach in the past, there is a compelling public interest\nin relevant information being disclosed.\u201d  An ECB spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit,\nwhich is based on the EU\u2019s freedom of information rules.  The Greek government didn\u2019t originally disclose the swaps,\ndesigned to help it comply with the deficit and debt rules it\nagreed to meet when it joined the euro in 2001.  Eurostat , the\nEU\u2019s statistics agency, said last month the swaps added 5.3\nbillion euros to the country\u2019s debt, without giving details.\nRepeated revisions of Greece\u2019s national accounts, beginning last\nyear, spurred a surge in borrowing costs that pushed the country\nto the brink of default and triggered a regionwide debt crisis.

J&J Directors Ignored \u2018Red Flags\u2019 on Recalls, Probes  A group of  Johnson & Johnson  shareholders accused the\ncompany\u2019s directors of ignoring \u201cred flags\u201d foreshadowing\nproduct recalls and government probes of manufacturing defects\nand marketing practices.  The  shareholders  asked a judge to find that directors and\ntop executives mismanaged  J&J  and order them to pay damages.\nThey also want J&J to \u201cimprove its corporate governance and\ninternal procedures,\u201d according to a complaint filed Dec. 17 in\nfederal court in Trenton, New Jersey. Any money recovered would\ngo to the company and not investors individually.  J&J, the world\u2019s  biggest maker  of health-care products,\nrecalled more than 40 types of medicines this year because of\ncontamination and incorrect labeling. U.S. lawmakers began\ninvestigating J&J after a recall of batches of children\u2019s\nTylenol in April forced the company to suspend operations at a\nPennsylvania plant. The probe uncovered the use of contractors\nto buy defective Motrin painkiller.  J&J also faces government investigations into whether it\nillegally marketed drugs and devices for uses not approved by\nthe Food and Drug Administration and paid kickbacks. On Dec. 17,\nshareholders amended their so-called derivative lawsuits that\nseek to force directors and officers to pay the company.  Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for New Brunswick, New\nJersey-based J&J, said the company is reviewing the complaint\nand has no comment.  The case is In Re Johnson & Johnson Derivative Litigation,\n10-cv-2033, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey\n(Trenton).  For more, click here.  ASIC Sues Macquarie, Bank of Queensland Over Storm  Bank of Queensland Ltd.  and  Macquarie Bank Ltd.  breached\ncontracts with investors and together with the  Commonwealth Bank\nof Australia  were involved in an unregistered investment scheme\nrelated to the collapse of Storm Financial Ltd., Australia\u2019s\nsecurities regulator said.  The Australian Securities & Investments Commission sued the\nthree banks in federal court yesterday seeking compensation for\ninvestors in Storm, which had managed A$4 billion ($4 billion).\nThe suit was filed after the regulator said it failed to reach\nan out-of-court settlement with the banks.  \u201cASIC has maintained that a commercial resolution is the\npreferred approach,\u201d Tony D\u2019Aloisio, the commission\u2019s chairman,\nsaid in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, discussions did not result\nin a satisfactory outcome.\u201d  Storm  induced investors to mortgage their homes, take out\nmargin loans, and put the money into Storm Australian Index\nTrusts with the promise their returns would be enough to pay the\nloans and live off the proceeds in retirement, according to\nASIC\u2019s statement of claim filed in federal court in Sydney\nyesterday.  Storm, which was based in Townsville, Queensland, received\ncommissions from the investments in the trusts and had a\nincentive to encourage clients to maximize the amount of money\nthey put into the funds, the regulator said.  The company collapsed in January, 2009, after banks\nnotified customers they were in breach of their margins. Storm\nsaid at the time trading losses resulted in a decline in income\nwhich the company couldn\u2019t absorb any longer.  Bank of Queensland said in a regulatory filing yesterday it\nintends to defend itself. The bank didn\u2019t act illegally or\ndishonestly, it said.  Commonwealth Bank said, \u201cThe bank fundamentally disagrees\nwith ASIC\u2019s view of the role of banks in losses suffered by\nStorm investors,\u201d the bank said in an e-mailed statement\nyesterday.  Macquarie and its staff acted ethically, lawfully and\nprofessionally, the bank said in an e-mailed statement\nyesterday.  The case is Australian Securities and Investments\nCommission v.

Lawsuits  MBIA May Use Statistical Sampling in Bank of America Suit  Bank of America Corp.  lost a bid to prevent  MBIA Inc.  from\nusing statistical sampling to pursue repurchase demands in a\nlawsuit claiming it was fraudulently induced to insure $21\nbillion in mortgage-backed securities.  MBIA  asked New York State Supreme Court Judge Eileen\nBransten to allow company lawyers to develop evidence using\nsamples from 368,000 mortgages in 15 securitized pools to\nestablish its fraud claims, rather than go through each loan.\nProceeding loan by loan might lead to \u201ca delay of several years\nbefore trial,\u201d Philippe Z. Selendy, an attorney for Armonk, New\nYork-based MBIA, said in an Oct. 13 letter to the judge.  \u201cThe court does not find any prejudice in deciding the\nmotion before it and allowing the use of statistically\nsignificant samples of the securitizations at issue,\u201d Bransten\nruled yesterday. She said the defendants could also choose to\nuse their \u201cown sampling chosen in a statistically valid\nmanner\u201d to rebut MBIA\u2019s arguments.  Bank of America said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d in the litigation\nto allow such sampling, according to court papers.  \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is limited and procedural in nature.\nNothing has been decided on the merits,\u201d Jerry Dubrowski, a\nspokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America,\nsaid yesterday in an e-mailed statement. \u201cAs the court notes,\nMBIA must prove each element of its claims -- this we believe it\ncannot do. We intend to continue to aggressively defend.\u201d  MBIA\u2019s suit against  Bank of America  and its Countrywide\nunit is one of at least 12 claims brought by insurers in state\nand federal courts targeting issuers of mortgage-backed\nsecurities, including Deutsche Bank AG, Credit Suisse and GMAC\nMortgage LLC. Government-owned mortgage companies Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac, and bond investors such as MetLife Inc., are also\npursuing repurchase demands from originators of the securities.  Bank of America is in talks with institutional investors,\nincluding Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blackrock Inc.,\nover repurchase demands, the bank said in a Dec. 16 statement.  A decision to allow sampling would reduce the time and cost\nof MBIA\u2019s litigation and aid other insurers and investors\npursuing put-back lawsuits, New York attorney David Grais said\nbefore the ruling was issued.

AIG Fine May Give Competitors Momentum in $1 Billion Lawsuit  American International Group Inc. , the company defending\nitself against a $1 billion workers\u2019 compensation lawsuit filed\nby rival insurers, may have handed its accusers momentum by\nagreeing to pay $146.5 million to settle a probe by regulators.  \u201cThat certainly can\u2019t help their position in court,\u201d said\nEdward Priz, president of Riverside, Illinois-based commercial\ninsurance consultant Advanced Insurance Management LLC.  AIG will pay $100 million in fines and $46.5 million in\ntaxes and assessments to resolve the 50-state investigation, the\nPennsylvania insurance regulator said yesterday. New York-based\nAIG was suspected of cheating state-run funds that serve as\ninsurers of last resort against workplace injuries.  AIG, once the world\u2019s largest insurer, shortchanged the\nstate pools by underreporting premiums it made selling workers\u2019\ncompensation protection, rivals including Liberty Mutual Holding\nCo. said in court documents filed in 2009 in U.S. District Court\nin Chicago. The state insurers of last resort, which cover\ninjuries at employers that pose unattractive risks, are funded\nby contributions from carriers that offer the coverage.  \u201cAccurate company financial data is an essential\ningredient of proper insurance regulation,\u201d Pennsylvania acting\ncommissioner Robert Pratter said in a statement. \u201cThis reflects\nthe seriousness of the violations in this instance over a\nsustained period of time -- primarily prior to 1996 -- by AIG\u2019s\nprior senior management.\u201d  The agreement, endorsed by eight states including\nPennsylvania, is contingent upon approval by at least 35 other\nregulatory jurisdictions and AIG\u2019s settlements with rival\ninsurers, according to the statement.  \u201cIf this settlement becomes final, we will have resolved\nall remaining regulatory issues related to AIG\u2019s workers\u2019\ncompensation premium reporting for our stakeholders,\u201d Mark\nHerr, an AIG spokesman, said in a statement.  The case is National Council on Compensation Insurance Inc.\nv. American International Group Inc. 1:07-cv-02898, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  For more, click here.

Trials/Appeals  RBS Unit May Win U.K. Tax Case After EU Court Ruling  A German unit of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  should\nwin a dispute with U.K. authorities over value-added tax in a\ncar-leasing agreement with a Vinci SA subsidiary, the European\nUnion\u2019s highest court said.  The  European Court of Justice  yesterday rejected claims by\nthe U.K. tax office that the car-leasing transaction amounted to\nan abusive practice solely aimed at getting a fiscal advantage.  RBS Deutschland  \u201cprovided the services at issue in the\ncourse of a genuine economic activity,\u201d a  five-judge panel  of\nthe EU court in Luxembourg ruled. \u201cWhere it is possible for the\ntaxable person to choose from among a number of transactions, he\nmay choose to structure his business in such a way as to limit\nhis tax liability.\u201d  Yesterday\u2019s ruling follows an EU court decision from 2006\nthat said the U.K. may ban companies from cutting their VAT bill\nby setting up artificial transactions that seek no other\ncommercial purpose than to avoid paying tax. U.K. Revenue and\nCustoms argued RBS\u2019s German unit had set up such a deal with\nVinci Fleet Services. The EU court disagreed.  The U.K. can\u2019t \u201crefuse to allow\u201d companies to recoup VAT\npaid on goods that are subsequently leased in other EU states\njust because these leasing transactions aren\u2019t subject to the\nlevy, the court said.  U.K. Revenue and Customs \u201cis currently considering the\nimpact of this judgment carefully,\u201d the tax office said in an\ne-mailed statement.

Lehman Client-Money Appeal by GLG Going to U.K. Supreme Court  A  GLG Partners Inc.  fund can appeal part of a ruling over\nbillions of dollars that Lehman Brothers International Europe\ndidn\u2019t properly protect by putting it in separate accounts.  The U.K. Supreme Court granted permission Dec. 20,\naccording to the judgment, which was posted yesterday on the\nwebsite of LBIE administrator PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  GLG, which had its money separated from the bank\u2019s, is\nappealing an August ruling by a London court. That decision said\nthe administrators must identify all client funds that weren\u2019t\nproperly segregated and pool them with accounts that were kept\nseparate. GLG is a unit of London-based  Man Group Plc .  Clients can claim from the pool, whether their money was\nseparated or not, according to the August judgment. It overturns\na lower court\u2019s decision to treat clients whose money wasn\u2019t\nseparated as unsecured creditors in the U.K. insolvency case,\nlikely giving them only a fraction of what they are owed.  \u201cThe joint administrators and the client money team\ncontinue to make progress in identifying client money in\nunsegregated bank and transaction accounts,\u201d PwC said.  Arun Srivastava, a lawyer for Hong Leung Bank Bhd., which\nrepresented the general estate in the dispute, said their\ninterests \u201cwill be put forward by GLG\u201d in the appeal.  Robert Turner, a lawyer for CRC Credit Fund Ltd., which\nacted on behalf of clients whose money wasn\u2019t segregated, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Another appeal in the case, by Lehman Brothers Inc., was\ndenied. The administrators also weren\u2019t granted permission to\nappeal but can act as respondents.  Modified Sugar Beet Crop\u2019s Destruction Put on Hold by Court  Genetically modified sugar beet plants that would produce\nseeds for the 2012 planting season can\u2019t yet be destroyed as\nordered by a judge, a federal appeals court in San Francisco\nruled.  The U.S. Court of Appeals put on hold until Feb. 28 a\njudge\u2019s Nov. 30 order to dig up 256 acres of sugar beet\nseedlings, or until it issues an order, whichever is first,\naccording to a ruling yesterday. Environmental groups sued the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture to block planting permits given\nfour companies for beets that were modified to withstand\n Monsanto Co. \u2019s Roundup herbicide.  Sugar beets, grown on 1.3 million acres in 10 states,\nprovide half the nation\u2019s sugar supply, according to the  Sugar\nIndustry Biotech Council . The groups and organic seed\norganizations claim wind-blown pollen from the genetically\nengineered crops will contaminate conventional sugar beets and\nother closely related plants.  Monsanto and sugar beet companies said the genetically\nmodified seedlings, or stecklings, could \u201csave the livelihoods\nof thousands of our nation\u2019s sugarbeet farmers,\u201d according to\ncourt filings. The plants won\u2019t flower before the permits expire\nin February, so there is no risk of gene flow, the USDA said in\ncourt filings.  The appeals court on Dec. 6 put a temporary hold on U.S.\nDistrict Judge Jeffrey White\u2019s Nov. 30 order, which the\ngovernment is appealing.  The case is Center for Food Safety v.
