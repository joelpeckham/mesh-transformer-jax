Home sales fell to 1,246 units last month compared with\n2,621 in September 2012, according to data from the  Urban\nRedevelopment Authority  released today. From the previous month,\nsales increased 65 percent from a revised 756 units sold in\nAugust as developers marketed more projects, the data showed.  Record home prices amid low  interest rates  raised concerns\nof a housing bubble and prompted the government to widen a\ncampaign that started in 2009 to curb speculation in Asia\u2019s\nsecond-most expensive housing market. Singapore unveiled new\nrules in June governing how financial institutions grant\nproperty loans to individuals, in addition to previous curbs\nincluding new taxes and higher down-payments.  \u201cThe total debt-servicing ratio measures is really biting\ninto the market now,\u201d said David Neubronner, national director\nof residential project sales in Singapore at broker  Jones Lang\nLaSalle Inc.
