 "context": "The following article called 'Brookfield Spinoff Plans to Expand Beyond Offices, Malls' was published on 2013-04-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrookfield Property Partners LP,\nthe $48 billion business being spun off by its Canadian parent,\nplans to pursue purchases beyond office and retail, the firm\u2019s\npast areas of focus, as its access to capital improves.  The spinoff, taking effect April 15, is the last of three\nmain business units to be carved out by Toronto-based  Brookfield\nAsset Management Inc. (BAM)  Like the other two, Brookfield Renewable\nEnergy Partners LP and  Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP (BIP) ,\nBrookfield Property Partners will be a limited partnership based\nin  Bermuda , a traditional tax haven.  \u201cFor capital efficiency and to simplify our story, we\nwanted the three big businesses to operate separately with their\nown balance sheets,\u201d Ric Clark, Brookfield Property\u2019s chief\nexecutive officer, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAt the\nheight of the economic crisis in \u201909, there were lots of\nopportunities but also competition amongst the groups at\nBrookfield for a finite amount of balance-sheet capital.\u201d  Brookfield Property is designed to give investors global\nexposure to commercial real estate, including investments in\nmultifamily and industrial as well as retail and office\nbuildings.  Brookfield Asset Management (BAM/A)  began investing in U.S.\nreal estate in 1976 with purchases of office buildings and\nshopping malls.  \u201cThey only locate in top markets and top-quality assets,\u201d\nRoss Moore, director of research for CBRE Canada, a unit of  CBRE\nGroup Inc. (CBG) , the world\u2019s largest commercial-property brokerage,\nsaid of Brookfield. \u201cThey\u2019re good investors and good operators.\nThey are very financially astute.\u201d  Rental Demand  Brookfield has been trying to expand in apartments and\nindustrial properties, two sectors where it hasn\u2019t had large\ninvestments, as rental-housing demand and global trade grow. One\npossible acquisition target is Gazeley Ltd., a London-based\nindustrial developer owned by Dubai-based Economic Zones World\nthat\u2019s valued at about 300 million pounds ($459 million),\naccording to a person briefed on the situation.  Melissa Coley , a spokeswoman for Brookfield Property,\ndeclined to comment on possible interest in Gazeley. Economic\nZones World didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail seeking comment on a\npotential sale.  Brookfield Asset Management tried to acquire Archstone Inc.\nin 2011 when the U.S. apartment landlord\u2019s shareholders sought\noffers for the company, according to two people with knowledge\nof the effort. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Archstone\u2019s\nbiggest shareholder at the time, later bought all of Archstone\nand last year agreed to sell its assets to  Equity Residential (EQR) \nand  AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB)   Andrew Willis, a spokesman for Brookfield Asset, and\n Kimberly Macleod , a spokeswoman for Lehman, declined to comment\non Brookfield\u2019s possible past interest in Archstone.  Apartment Purchases  In February, Brookfield Asset Management bought 19\napartment complexes in the Carolinas and Virginia from Babcock &\nBrown Residential Inc. for $414 million. The multifamily\nportfolio is part of Brookfield Property Partners, which has\nassets valued at about $48 billion.  \u201cNow that we\u2019ve created a separate company, we have the\nability to raise our own equity in the public markets to support\nour growth plans,\u201d Clark, 54, said.  Brookfield Property Partners today consists mainly of\nstakes in two publicly traded companies: 50 percent of\n Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO) , the biggest U.S. office\nlandlord, with about 64 million square feet of space either\nwholly or partly owned, and about 22 percent of  General Growth\nProperties Inc. (GGP) , the No. 2 U.S. shopping-mall landlord.  General Growth  Together with warrants and fund partners,  Brookfield owns \nabout 42 percent of General Growth. Brookfield also has a 37\npercent direct stake in  Rouse Properties Inc. (RSE) , a mall landlord\nspun off from General Growth, and a 54 percent stake with its\npartners.  The stakes in Brookfield Office, General Growth and Rouse\nmake up about 75 percent of Brookfield Property Partners, with\nprivate real estate funds and directly owned assets accounting\nfor the rest, said Coley, the Brookfield Property spokeswoman.\nThat percentage is likely to shrink as the company makes more\ndirect purchases of real estate, she said.  \u201cThe intention is to change that balance so in the near\nterm it\u2019s more like 50-50,\u201d Coley said. \u201cLonger term, the\npublic companies could be less significant -- more like 10 or 20\npercent,\u201d with directly held real estate and funds making up\nthe balance.  Hard Rock  In 2011, Brookfield Asset Management seized control of the\nHard Rock Hotel and Casino in  Las Vegas  through a mezzanine loan\nthat was converted to equity, and took over three resorts from\nSouth African casino magnate Sol Kerzner\u2019s company, including\nthe Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas. Those assets also\nare now part of Brookfield Property Partners.  Brookfield Asset Management will spin off the property unit\nthrough a special dividend of about 36 million units of the new\ncompany. Holders of Class A and B shares will receive 5.74 units\nof Brookfield Property for every 100 Brookfield Asset shares\nheld as of March 26. After the spinoff, the parent will hold an\neffective economic stake of about 92.5 percent in the property\nunit, according to a company filing.  The stake held by Brookfield Asset will decline as\nBrookfield Property, which pays its parent a management fee,\nsells shares to fund acquisitions, Coley said. Brookfield Office\nProperties, meanwhile, will continue to operate as a separate\npublicly traded company.  \u2018Get Exposure\u2019  \u201cIf there\u2019s a Class A office building that\u2019s for sale in a\nmarket that\u2019s a part of Brookfield Office\u2019s strategy, they\u2019re\ngoing to pursue that transaction, and Brookfield Property would\nget exposure through its investment in Brookfield Office\nProperties,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe creation of Brookfield Property\ndoes not change the way Brookfield Office operates.\u201d  Brookfield Asset Management traces its roots to  Brazil ,\nwhere it started as a power company in the 1890s. One of the\ngroup\u2019s early real estate investments was the 1971 acquisition\nof the company that owns the Montreal Forum and the Montreal\nCanadiens hockey team. The arena and the team were sold in 1978,\nafter the Canadiens won five Stanley Cup championships.  Brookfield Infrastructure Partners, which began trading in\nJanuary 2008, has  doubled  since then, compared with a 12 percent\ngain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index. Brookfield  Renewable\nEnergy  has risen about 21 percent since it began trading on the\nToronto Stock Exchange on Nov. 30, 2011, compared with 1.1\npercent for the S&P/TSX Composite Index. The returns exclude\ndividends.  Flagship Complex  Brookfield Asset Management acquired its flagship U.S.\nproperty, formerly called the World Financial Center, in the\n1990s through the recapitalization of Olympia & York USA,\npreviously owned by Canada\u2019s Reichmann family. The property is\nnow part of Brookfield Office Properties.  Brookfield Office needs to find tenants for the complex,\nwhere lead tenant Merrill Lynch\u2019s lease expires in September.\nNew tenants are needed for 3 million square feet (280,000 square\nmeters) after Merrill, which leased 4.6 million square feet,\ndecided to keep some space and Brookfield signed leases for part\nof the space being vacated. The World Financial Center was\nrenamed Brookfield Place last year.  \u201cI suspect they\u2019re wishing they didn\u2019t have quite that\nmuch exposure in lower  Manhattan ,\u201d said Moore of CBRE. \u201cThat\u2019s\na fairly large albatross hanging from their neck. It\u2019s a big\nchunk of real estate and now you\u2019re having to compete with all\nthe new construction.\u201d  Toronto Tower  Other Brookfield Office assets include the 72-story First\nCanadian Place in Toronto, Bank of America Plaza in  Los Angeles ,\nHouston\u2019s Allen Center complex and properties in  Australia .  Besides its public-company holdings, Brookfield Property\nPartners also has stakes in private-equity funds. Its funds\ninclude vehicles for opportunistic investments, real estate\nfinance, Canadian offices and Brazilian retail properties.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing opportunities in almost all sectors,\u201d Clark\nsaid. \u201cThe  U.S. economy  is poised for growth. We think  Europe \u2019s\ngot a way to go, but we are seeing lots of opportunities\nthere.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nHui-yong Yu in Seattle at \n hyu@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nKara Wetzel at \n kwetzel@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP Limited Partnership Units was 15.628921508789062 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP Limited Partnership Units was ",
