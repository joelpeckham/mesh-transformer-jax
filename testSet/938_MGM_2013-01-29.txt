(1928) , the Macau casino\noperator controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , could get a\nrevenue and profit boost after receiving government approval\nthis month for 200 more gaming tables.  The gambling company may get about $500 million in added\nrevenue annually from the new tables, CLSA Ltd. analyst Aaron\nFischer said via e-mail. It would get an additional $200 million\nof Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization each year, he said.  Sands China has joined rivals such as  Galaxy Entertainment\nGroup Ltd. (27)  in expanding on Macau\u2019s popular Cotai strip, a piece\nof reclaimed land that is Asia\u2019s equivalent of the Las Vegas\nstrip. Sands plans to invest at least $2.5 billion to build The\nParisian, its fifth resort in Macau.  Sands China Chief Executive Officer Edward Tracy confirmed\nthe company received approval for the new tables in a press\nconference yesterday. Some of the new tables will be added ahead\nof the Chinese New Year holiday that starts Feb. 10, he said.  Sands China gained 1.6 percent to HK$38.15 in Hong Kong\ntrading, boosting its  advance  this month to 12 percent. While\nthat beats the Hang Seng Index\u2019s 4.4 percent gain, it\u2019s lower\nthan the 26 percent jump for MGM China Holdings Ltd. and the 22\npercent surge for Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd.  Market Share  The increase in tables will mean Sands China will have\nabout 26 percent of casino tables in Macau, David Bain, an\nanalyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. who recommends buying the\nstock, said in a research note.  Billionaire Stanley Ho\u2019s  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880)  has the highest\nmarket share by revenue among Macau\u2019s six casino operators this\nmonth, at 26.2 percent, with Sands China ranked second at 19.6\npercent, according to Bain\u2019s estimates.  Macau casino  revenue  rose 20 percent to a record of 28.2\nbillion patacas ($3.5 billion) last month, as Christmas\npromotions drew more holiday-makers to the only city in China\nwhere casino gambling is legal. Full-year casino revenue\nincreased 14 percent to 304 billion patacas, also a record.
