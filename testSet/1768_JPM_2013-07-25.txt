 "context": "The following article called 'Repo Market Contracts as Dealers Face More Capital Requirements' was published on 2013-07-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe market for borrowing and lending\nU.S. government debt, after shrinking 31 percent in the past\nfive years, risks contracting further as global regulators\nconsider raising capital and leverage standards for banks.  The 21 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve\naveraged $2.71 trillion a day in repurchase agreements last\nmonth, down from a peak of $4.28 trillion in the first quarter\nof 2008, according to Fed data compiled by the Securities\nIndustry and Financial Markets  Association . Combined with\nreverse repurchase agreements, the average was $4.82 trillion,\ndown from $7.02 trillion in the first three months of 2008.  U.S. regulators on July 7 proposed ordering eight of the\nlargest lenders to hold capital equivalent to 5 percent of\nassets at their parent companies and 6 percent at their banking\nunits, surpassing the 3 percent global minimum that the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision approved to help prevent\nanother financial crisis. In a repo, a dealer provides\nsecurities as collateral to another in exchange for cash; in a\nreverse repo, the opposite takes place.  \u201c\u2018The proposals for higher capital and lower leverage\nwon\u2019t eliminate repo, but are factors that will squeeze it,\u201d\n Alex Roever , head of short-term fixed-income strategy at\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. in  Chicago , said in a July 23 telephone\ninterview. \u201cIf you are thinking about dealers providing\nliquidity to the bond market, then anything that weighs on repo\nmarket is another limiting factor. We already have dealers who\nare constrained as far as using their balance sheet to provide\nliquidity to the market.\u201d  Leverage Ratios  The push for larger capital cushions and less leverage for\nU.S. lenders was followed last week by a proposal from European\nregulators for an enhanced leverage ratio to measure equity to\ntotal assets, eschewing formulas that let banks hold less\ncapital for assets deemed less risky. If the proposals are\nincorporated into U.S. regulations, it could cause derivatives,\nsecurities financing transactions and other off-balance-sheet\nitems to be counted as assets in the leverage ratios, making\nrepo activity less appealing.  The Basel Committee proposals would disallow the current\npractice of banks netting repos against reverse repos, causing\nbanks\u2019 leverage exposure levels to rise and triggering needs to\ncut repo activity. The Basel III requirements for securities\nfinancing transaction would cause repos, reverse repos, margin\nand securities lending and borrowing transaction to be reported\non a gross basis, with no provision to net exposure.  Average Rate  Reduced dealer activity in the repurchase-agreement market\nhas been a contributing factor in driving repo rates down over\nthe past year, according to Roever.  The  average rate  for borrowing and lending Treasuries for\none day in the repo market was 0.046 percent yesterday and has\naveraged 0.12 percent this year, according to a GCF repo index\nprovided on a one-day lag by the Depository Trust & Clearing\nCorp. That compares with a 0.157 percent average over the past\nthree years. The overnight Treasury general collateral\nrepurchase agreement rate opened yesterday at 0.07 percent,\naccording to ICAP Plc, the world\u2019s largest inter-dealer broker.  In a general collateral repo transaction, the lender of\nfunds is willing to accept a variety of Treasury, mortgage-backed securities or agency collateral.  Market Volatility  \u201cLiquidity in fixed-income markets could be impaired and\ntrading volumes would likely fall, particularly for Treasuries\nand other low-return-on-asset businesses\u201d if the stronger Basel\nIII rules are implemented in the U.S., wrote Brian Smedley, an\ninterest-rate strategist in New York at Bank of America Corp.,\nin a note published on July 19. \u201cMarket volatility would likely\nbe amplified by the new rules, if and when they take effect, as\nthe reduced elasticity of bank balance sheets will constrain\ntheir ability to provide liquidity to clients during periods of\nfinancial stress. We would also expect bid-ask spreads to widen\nand hedging costs to rise,\u201d he wrote.  In a repurchase agreement, one party provides cash to\nanother in exchange for a security, and vice versa. Repos are\ntypically used to finance holdings, meaning movements in the\nrates affect the cost of holding the securities in inventory.\nThe Fed uses the agreements to meet its target interest rate for\novernight loans between banks.  Collateral Netting  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch\nOption Volatility Move  index  surged to 117.89 on July 5, the\nhighest since December 2010. The gauge, which measures\nvolatility based on prices of over-the-counter options on\nTreasuries maturing in two to 30 years, has averaged 64.8 over\nthe last year.  Banks have been focused on increasing their highest-quality\ncapital since 2007 to shore up balance sheets after the global\nfinancial crisis and to meet tougher rules. The focus on\nleverage is the latest effort by financial watchdogs to prevent\na repeat of the taxpayer-funded bank rescues of 2008.  The most significant impact if the enhanced Basel III\nregulations are implemented by U.S. regulators would to the repo\nmarkets, according to JPMorgan, due to the provision disallow\nthe netting of collateral.  All of \u201cthese regulations will affect the repo market as\nit essentially changes the entire perspective that you approach\nyour bank balance sheet,\u201d Andrew Hollenhorst, fixed-income\nstrategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in a July 23\ntelephone interview. \u201cWith the new supplementary leverage ratio\nis doing is forcing you to look at our balance sheet from the\nperspective of return on total assets given it doesn\u2019t apply any\nrisk weighting. So some of the assets that might have made sense\nbefore, such as repo, might not make sense anymore.\u201d  -With assistance from Nicholas Comfort in  Frankfurt  and Elisa\nMartinuzzi in Milan.
