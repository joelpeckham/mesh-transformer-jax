 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Multinationals Lobby to Alter Tax Rules They Sought' was published on 2012-06-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. multinational companies have\nbeen seeking a tax break on overseas income for years, and the\ntop Republican tax writer in Congress is proposing to give it to\nthem. There\u2019s a catch they don\u2019t like.  Businesses and trade groups are lobbying House Ways and\nMeans Committee Chairman  Dave Camp  to loosen rules in his draft\nplan that would make it more difficult for companies to shift\nincome from the U.S. to lower-taxed countries. Among those\ngroups is the  National Foreign Trade Council , whose board\nincludes officials of  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ,  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)   \u201cIt\u2019s a good-faith effort, but we are a long way from\ndeveloping a package that everyone can sign on to,\u201d said\nCatherine Schultz, vice president for  tax policy  at the trade\ngroup, which advocates expanded international commerce. \u201cYou\nwould not get a lot of the business community supporting this if\nthis was a final draft.\u201d  The debate over foreign income is a preview of how\ndifficult a tax overhaul, which both political parties say they\nwant, is going to be. While many -- though not all -- companies\nknow they don\u2019t like what Camp proposes, they don\u2019t agree about\nhow to fix it. What some companies call fair others see as\nunjustified, depending on what line of business they are in and\nhow their global operations are organized.  \u201cThere are a few Veruca Salts who want it all and want it\nnow,\u201d said Camp, comparing a minority of companies to the\nfictional spoiled rich kid from the book and movie \u201cCharlie and\nthe Chocolate Factory.\u201d  Offsetting Gain  In many cases, tighter rules on moving income to low-tax\ncountries such as  Bermuda  would offset much of the gain from the\nexemption Camp is proposing.  U.S. multinational companies, including Google Inc., Cisco\nSystems Inc., and Forest Laboratories Inc., save billions of\ndollars in  taxes  annually by shifting profits into subsidiaries\nin tax havens, often using techniques with nicknames like\n\u201cdouble Irish\u201d and \u201cDutch sandwich.\u201d  Under current law, U.S. companies owe the 35 percent U.S.\ncorporate tax rate on all the income they earn around the world.\nThey get credits for tax payments to foreign governments, and\nthey don\u2019t pay the U.S. anything until they bring the money\nhome.  Camp, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Republican\npresidential candidate Mitt Romney say the U.S. tax system makes\nit harder for American companies to compete internationally with\nbusinesses from the U.K.,  Germany  and Japan whose home countries\ndon\u2019t impose additional taxes on foreign profits.  President Obama  President  Barack Obama  contends the  tax code  already\nprovides incentives to move business offshore. He wants to deny\ntax deductions for the cost of moving production abroad and make\nit harder for companies to defer U.S. taxes on overseas income.  \u201cIt still makes no sense for us to be giving tax breaks to\ncompanies that are shipping jobs and factories overseas,\u201d the\npresident said May 30.  The plan offered by Camp, a Michigan Republican, assumes\nthe corporate tax rate will drop to 25 percent from 35 percent,\nand it would give companies a 95 percent exemption on their\nforeign income. The plan has three options to keep companies\nfrom eroding the U.S. tax base by shifting income overseas, and\nthat\u2019s what has prompted much of the business reticence.  Not Popular  \u201cThe base-erosion provisions have not been particularly\npopular,\u201d said Pamela Olson, deputy tax leader at\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in  Washington . Companies are trying\nto come up with an alternate proposal though it is a \u201ctortuous\npath,\u201d she said.  Camp, 58, said in a statement that companies should be\nrealistic and understand the choice is between Republicans\u2019\n\u201cpro-growth reforms\u201d and \u201cmassive tax hikes the president and\nDemocrats are talking about.\u201d  Most companies realize a tax plan must \u201cbalance the need\nof raising the same level of revenue with reforms that make us\nmore competitive and lead to stronger economic growth, and that\nincludes necessary safeguards,\u201d he said.  Dave Cote, chairman and chief executive officer of\nHoneywell International Inc., based in Morris Township, New\nJersey, said in a statement that the company supports Camp\u2019s\nefforts.  Prohibit Abuse  \u201cWe applaud the chairman\u2019s invitation to the business\ncommunity to provide feedback and recognize that the legislation\nwill include provisions to prohibit abuse and maintain a U.S.\ncorporate tax base,\u201d Cote said. He said the plan needs to\n\u201cserve both American business competitiveness and the need to\npreserve  tax revenue  in order to address our growing national\ndeficit and debt issues.\u201d  Camp\u2019s plan would offset the tax revenue lost from the 95\npercent exemption. Some would be made up by requiring companies\nto pay taxes on more than $1 trillion in overseas profits they\naccumulated earlier and haven\u2019t brought home.  Part would come from Camp\u2019s options for making it tougher\nfor companies to gain an advantage by shifting income to a\nlower-tax country. One idea, borrowed from the Obama\nadministration, would tax excess profits -- as defined by the\ngovernment -- from companies\u2019 intangible overseas assets, such\nas patents and trademarks. A second, modeled after a Japanese\nlaw, would exempt overseas income from U.S. taxes if a company\npaid at least 10 percent in foreign taxes.  Third Option  The third alternative would set a 15 percent tax rate on\ninternational income from all intangible assets. If a country\u2019s\neffective tax rate isn\u2019t at least 13.5 percent, the company\nwould have to immediately pay enough U.S. taxes to bring the\ntotal to 15 percent.  For example, a company that earns $1 million from\nintangible assets in Ireland, which has a 12.5 percent tax rate,\nwould pay $125,000 to Ireland and $25,000 immediately to the\nU.S.  The  National Association of Manufacturers  has criticized\nthe provisions.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be overseas and we\u2019re trying to be\nprofitable and compete,\u201d said Dorothy Coleman, the trade\ngroup\u2019s vice president of domestic and economic policy. \u201cThe\ngoal is not to erode the U.S. tax base. The goal is to be\ncompetitive and be part of the global economy.\u201d  Semiconductor Industry  The three options may undercut the gain from the 95 percent\nexemption, the  Semiconductor Industry Association  said in a\nMarch 14 letter to Camp.  \u201cWe urge the committee to look at other countries and\nexplore how these proposals would fit within the norms of\ninternational taxation, and how these proposals fit within a\ngoal for a competitive tax system,\u201d Bill Blaylock, vice\npresident and senior tax counsel at Texas Instruments Inc.,\n wrote  on the group\u2019s behalf. \u201cIt appears to us that they would\nnot fit.\u201d  The semiconductor group\u2019s letter said Camp\u2019s three options\nwould lead to disputes over how to define income from intangible\nassets and calculate effective tax rates.  Camp and Obama understand how companies are trying to\nreduce their taxes by taking advantage of lower-taxed\njurisdictions, said Reuven Avi-Yonah, a law professor at the\n University of Michigan  in Ann Arbor.  Businesses don\u2019t like Camp\u2019s approach \u201cfor precisely the\nreason that I like it,\u201d Avi-Yonah said.  \u2018Hopeful Area\u2019  Camp\u2019s base-erosion proposals represent \u201ca very important\nand very hopeful area of consensus,\u201d  Jason Furman , the deputy\ndirector of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said at\na May 17 National Tax Association conference.  Executives from some companies, including  Intel Corp .,\nPraxair Inc. and United Technologies Corp., say they can\ntolerate the base-erosion provisions, in part as a way to get\nthe 95 percent exemption on overseas taxes.  \u201cYou look at each provision and you find something good or\nbad about it, but in totality we look at the entire proposal,\u201d\nsaid Tobin Treichel, a tax vice president at  United\nTechnologies (UTX) , the maker of Otis elevators and Pratt & Whitney\naircraft engines.  Treichel called Camp\u2019s third option \u201cmore refined and more\ntargeted\u201d than the second option. His company relies on\nintellectual property based in the U.S., while high-tech\ncompanies have moved such assets out of the country and would be\nmore likely to face higher taxes under the third alternative.  Business Roundtable  The  Business Roundtable , an association of chief executives\nof the largest U.S. companies, wants to ensure that the rules\ndon\u2019t put U.S. companies at a disadvantage, said  Matt Miller , a\nvice president at the group.  \u201cNone of our trading partners have such broad rules that\nhave such broad application, so that\u2019s kind of the concern,\u201d he\nsaid.  Coleman, of the manufacturers\u2019 group, said companies are\nstudying how the proposal may affect international operations\nestablished under today\u2019s rules.  \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress,\u201d she said, \u201cand that\u2019s the way\nwe viewed it.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nRichard Rubin in Washington at \n rrubin12@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJodi Schneider at \n jschneider50@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Oracle Corporation was 22.604087829589844 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Oracle Corporation was ",
