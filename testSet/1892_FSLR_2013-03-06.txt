Our problem is the impact of fiscal contraction, sluggish growth and investors being overly enthusiastic about the implications of the housing market.\u201d  Raw-material, financial and health-care companies had the largest gains among  10 groups  in the S&P 500, while telephone and consumer staples fell the most.
