REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nThe San Diego-based firm withdrew its earlier antitrust application on Saturday at the request of China\u2019s commerce ministry, just days before the regulator\u2019s April 17 deadline to decide on the transaction expires, the sources said. \nClinching the NXP takeover, the world\u2019s biggest in the semiconductor sector, is crucial to Qualcomm, which is seeking to diversify its customer base and become the leading chip supplier to the fast-growing automotive market. \nThe U.S. chipmaker has already received approval from eight of nine required global regulators to finalise the acquisition, with Chinese clearance the only one pending. \nBy refiling, Qualcomm will provide the Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) potentially with another six-month window to review its application. It will be the second time Qualcomm would be refiling its antitrust application with Mofcom. \nAnalysts, however, said a decision by Mofcom on the deal is unlikely to come before trade and investment tensions between China and the United States are resolved. \n\u201cQualcomm is going to have to wait for Washington and Beijing to resolve their differences before this deal is going to move forward,\u201d said Erick Robinson, director of patent litigation and licensing at Beijing East IP. \nEarlier this month, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump proposed $50 billion worth of tariffs on some 1,300 industrial, technology, transport and medical products to force changes in Beijing\u2019s intellectual property practices. \nBeijing immediately responded with a list of proposed duties of $50 billion on key American imports.

Mofcom didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. \nAntitrust concerns were believed to have been raised during the most recent round of discussions, but Qualcomm\u2019s position was these were unfounded and not related to the deal, the sources said. \nQualcomm is understood to have offered a series of guarantees to Mofcom to assure that NXP customers wouldn\u2019t need to also purchase Qualcomm licenses. \nThe U.S. chipmaker, which initially announced its bid for the Dutch semiconductor company in October 2016, said in February that it was raising its bid to $127.50 per share, valuing NXP at $44 billion. \nThat sweetener came weeks before Trump, citing national security, ordered rival Broadcom Ltd to halt its proposed $117 billion buyout of Qualcomm.\u200d\u200b \nShares in Qualcomm have dropped about 13 percent since the start of the year, while NXP stock has shed about 3 percent over the same period.
