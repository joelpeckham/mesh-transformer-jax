The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  signed an\nagreement with BDL Ireland Management Ltd. that may allow the\ncompany to manage hotels tied to the bank\u2019s 1 billion-euro ($1.3\nbillion) of Irish lodging loans, according to two people with\nknowledge of the matter.  Receivers to hotels that defaulted on their loans from the\nLondon-based bank will have the option to use  BDL \u2019s property\nmanagement services, said the people, who declined to be\nidentified because the matter is private. BDL built 30 hotels in\nthe U.K. and managed 45 through November, according to its\nwebsite. Lloyds spokesman Ian Kitts and BDL Ireland managing\ndirector Andrew Gill declined to comment.  Lloyds said in February that two-thirds of its 24.8 billion\npounds ($40 billion) of loans in Ireland are unlikely to be paid\nback in full following the country\u2019s real-estate crash. That\u2019s\nup from 53 percent at the end of 2010. The bank is reaching\nincentive-laden deals in Ireland and the U.K. with real-estate\nmanagement groups such as BDL as it seeks to boost recovery on\nits loans.  \u201cThe hotel market in Ireland is still plagued by\noversupply,\u201d Jonathan Hubbard, Northern Europe chief executive\nofficer at the hotels division of broker  Jones Lang LaSalle\nInc. (JLL) , said in an April 10 statement. \u201cThe divergent trading\nperformance of the Dublin tourism and hotel market compared to\nIreland\u2019s provinces has created something of a two-tiered\nmarketplace, with the Dublin hotel market attracting the\nmajority of investor attention.\u201d  More than half of the loans to Ireland\u2019s hotels and\nrestaurants weren\u2019t performing at the end of 2010, according to\na report by its central bank. One in seven had defaulted or was\nimpaired.  Values Plunge  Hotel values in Dublin have fallen by 50 percent to 60\npercent since their peak in 2007,  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  director Paul\nCollins said. He handled last month\u2019s sale of the Morrison Hotel\non Dublin\u2019s north quays for 22 million euros to Russian\nbusinesswoman Elena Baturina, who bought it through Austrian\ncompany Beneco Privatstiftung, according to a statement from the\nbroker.  About 12 bids for the hotel were received after more than\n\u201c70 serious expressions of interest,\u201d Collins said by\ntelephone. \u201cThe market for prime Dublin hotels is very strong,\nfuelled by predominantly overseas buyers.\u201d  Last year Lloyds agreed to allow Dublin-based Green\nProperty Ventures Ltd. to manage real estate tied to as much as\n1 billion euros in Irish loans. The bank also signed a deal with\nLondon-based  Grainger Plc (GRI)  to manage U.K. residential properties\nthat are in the insolvency process after borrowers defaulted.
