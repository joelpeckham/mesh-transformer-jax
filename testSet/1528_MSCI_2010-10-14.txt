 "context": "The following article called 'Bunds Stay Near Two-Week High as Stocks Sap Demand; Two-Year Yield at 0.8%' was published on 2010-10-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGerman 10-year government bond\nyields were near their highest level in two weeks as rising\nequities drained demand for the safest assets.  Bund yields remained within the 16-basis-point range they\nhave occupied since Sept. 24. Italy sold 5.5 billion euros ($7.7\nbillion) of 2015, 2023 and 2037 bonds today.  The MSCI World\nIndex  advanced 0.4 percent, a second straight gain. Spanish\nbonds rose versus German bunds after the nation\u2019s central bank\nsaid local lenders reduced borrowing from the European Central\nBank by 11 percent in September.  \u201cRisk is on today, and that\u2019s putting bunds under a little\nbit of pressure,\u201d said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income\nstrategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. \u201cThe\nItalian bond auctions were comfortably absorbed, which led to\nmodest spread narrowing versus bunds.\u201d  German 10-year yields rose less than one basis point to 2.3\npercent as of 4:10 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security due\nSeptember 2020 fell 0.04, or 40 euro cents per 1,000-euro face\namount, to 99.65. The yield rose to 2.32 percent on Oct. 8, the\nhighest since Oct. 1. The two-year note yield rose one basis\npoint to 0.80 percent.  Irish bonds rose relative to benchmark German bunds,\nnarrowing the  yield spread  by 26 basis points to 387 basis\npoints. The  spread  between Italian and German 10-year bonds fell\nby two basis points to 145 basis points. Portuguese and Spanish\nbonds were also higher versus bunds, while Greek bonds fell.  Italy sold 3.5 billion euros of 3 percent 2015 notes at an\naverage yield of 2.53 percent, the Bank of Italy said today. The\nsale attracted bids worth 1.37 times the securities offered,\ncompared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.44 the last time they\nwere sold, on Sept. 13.  Italian Sales, Spanish Spread  Italy also issued 846 million euros of 4.75 percent 2023\nbonds at an average yield of 3.98 percent. The bid-to-cover\nratio was 2.49 versus 1.5 at the last sale, on July 14. The\n1.154 billion-euro sale of 4 percent 2037 bonds were issued at\nan average yield of 4.53 percent, and a bid-to-cover ratio of\n1.97 versus 1.9 at the previous sale on June 11.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year\ndebt instead of equivalent German paper shrank by four basis\npoints to 170 basis points. Spanish banks\u2019 ECB borrowings fell\nto 97.7 billion euros in September from 109.8 billion euros in\nAugust, the Bank of Spain said today on its website. That\ncompared with the overall euro region\u2019s increase to 447.7\nbillion euros from 428.5 billion euros.  ECB Liquidity  Greek bank reliance on ECB liquidity declined in September\nfor a second-straight month, according to the country\u2019s central\nbank. Lenders had a total of 94.3 billion euros for refinancing\noperations compared with 95.9 billion euros in August, according\nto a statement on the Athens-based Bank of Greece\u2019s website.  German 10-year yields climbed as much as seven basis points\nyesterday after European Central Bank Council member  Axel Weber \nsaid the ECB should stop its bond-buying program and prepare to\nwithdraw other emergency measures. Bund yields have stayed\nwithin a  range  of 2.36 percent and 2.2 percent since Sept. 24.  The ECB said a policy of raising interest rates to deflate\nasset-price bubbles shouldn\u2019t be dismissed on principle.  Recent research has shifted the balance in favor of such an\napproach, known as leaning against the wind, \u201ceven if the\neconomic science is still divided on these issues,\u201d the ECB\nsaid in a book published in Frankfurt today. In a footnote to\nthe book, entitled \u201cEnhancing Monetary Analysis,\u201d the bank\nsaid several members of its Executive Board have in the past\nshown \u201csome sympathy for the principle.\u201d  Monetary analysis confirms that \u201cinflationary pressures\nremain contained\u201d in the euro region, the ECB said. There are\n\u201cneither inflationary nor deflationary risks\u201d and credit\ngrowth is behaving \u201cin line with historical relationships.\u201d  Spain, Italy \u2018Well-Placed\u2019  Greek, Irish and Portuguese bond yields will remain at\n\u201cwide\u201d premiums to German debt because the nations\u2019 fiscal\nproblems will persist, HSBC Holdings Inc. said.  Spain and Italy, also seen as high-deficit countries, are\n\u201crelatively well-placed\u201d by comparison,  Steve Major , global\nhead of fixed-income research at HSBC in London, said in an e-\nmailed note. He cited the bank\u2019s so-called sovereign scorecard,\nwhich uses data such as ratios of interest payments to revenue\nand deficit to gross domestic product.  German bonds have returned 2.1 percent since June 30,\ncompared with 3 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 3.7 percent for\nU.K. gilts, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the\nEuropean Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Greek bonds handed investors 13 percent returns during the\nperiod, while Irish securities lost 2.6 percent and Portuguese\ndebt 0.9 percent.
