MegaFon, controlled by Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov \nand part-owned by Sweden\u2019s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , rose 1 percent at\n2:06 p.m. in  London , extending gains since its November initial\npublic offering to 69 percent. That valued the company at $20.9\nbillion, while MTS is worth $20.7 billion in  New York .  A focus on its network\u2019s data speeds has allowed MegaFon to\noutpace MTS in attracting Russians increasingly surfing the Web\nand watching video on their wireless devices. Moscow-based\nMegaFon boosted data revenue 23 percent in the first quarter,\nexpanding its profit margins.  \u201cMegaFon has reported excellent first-quarter results,\nwhich substantially beat expectations on profitability,\u201d\nKonstantin Chernyshev, an analyst at UralSib Capital, said today\nin a note.  Investors will get 64.51 rubles ($2.05) per ordinary share\nas a payout for 2012 and the first quarter of this year, MegaFon\nsaid today. Net income rose to 12.6 billion rubles in the\nquarter ending March 31 from 9.3 billion a year earlier. That\nexceeded the average analyst estimate by 19 percent, Chernyshev\nsaid.  Forecast Raised  Operating income before depreciation and amortization rose\n27 percent to 32.4 billion rubles as the company cut subscriber-acquisition costs by switching its dealer compensation\narrangements to revenue-sharing. The margin on that measure of\nprofit expanded to 47.8 percent from 40.6 percent a year\nearlier.  MegaFon raised its forecast for 2013 Oibda margin, saying\nit will be as wide as 44 percent compared with a previous\nprojection for up to 43 percent, Chief Financial Officer Gevork Vermishyan told reporters today. MegaFon expects \u201chigh single-digit\u201d revenue growth this year, it said in the statement.  MegaFon\u2019s share price reflects enterprise value of 6.1\ntimes 2013 forecast Oibda, while the ratio for MTS is 4.4,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company cut net debt 16 percent during the quarter to\n100.8 billion rubles.
