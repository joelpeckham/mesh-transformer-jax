 "context": "The following article called 'Tardif Favors Enbridge as Sprott Bull Days End' was published on 2012-09-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJean-Francois Tardif, who produced\n19 percent annual returns from 2004 to 2009 buying commodities\nshares for Sprott Asset Management LP, says he now favors\n\u201cboring\u201d stocks such as  HealthLease (HLP-U)  Properties REIT and\nEnbridge Inc., the pipeline operator.  He\u2019s focusing on income preservation at Timelo Investment\nManagement Inc., a firm he started in Aurora, Ontario in March,\nbecause he says the  bull market  in commodities is over. Tardif\ninvested in junior energy and gold companies before leaving\nSprott in 2009.  \u201cThe world was great then,\u201d said Tardif, whose firm was\nhired to manage the C$117.3 million ($119.9 million)  JFT\nStrategies Fund (JFS-U)  for First Asset Investment Management Inc.,\nwhich runs about C$2.6 billion. \u201cWe had a bull market in\ncommodities, but now we\u2019re deleveraging, and demand isn\u2019t\nexploding. It will be very hard for commodities to go up\nsubstantially.\u201d  Tardif, 43, was named the best Canada-based hedge fund\nmanager by global magazine  HFMWeek  in 2007. He left to spend\nmore time with his family and to lower his eight handicap in\ngolf, Tardif said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s Toronto office.  His new fund features fixed-income products, with seven of\nthe top 10 holdings in government and corporate bonds at the end\nof August, including debt from  Shoppers Drug Mart Inc. (SC) , BMW\n Canada  Inc., and  CI Financial Corp. (CIX)  About 40 percent of the fund\nis in fixed income. Tardif expects to reduce those positions as\nhe builds the fund.  Convertible Bonds  \u201cI\u2019d never invested in fixed income before in my life,\u201d\nhe said. He is also buying convertible bonds, a fixed-income\nproduct which allows the holder to convert the securities to\nequity. He also takes short positions, allowing him to bet\nagainst a stock by borrowing shares and selling them, aiming to\nprofit by repaying the shares at a lower price. The fund is\nrestricted to no more than a 15 percent position in a single\nsecurity.  Three of his equity positions -- HealthLease,  Enbridge (ENB)  and\n Badger Daylighting Ltd. (BAD)  -- are a change from the junior gold\nminers and oil and gas explorers he owned in his Sprott days.  \u201cI used to not care if a company gave a dividend or not,\nbecause my goal was for stocks that would double in three or\nfour years,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s more about income and making\nsure if something goes bad in the world economy you don\u2019t go\ndown 80 percent.\u201d  With his new fund, Tardif\u2019s equity strategy is to seek\ncompanies in Canada, the U.S. and elsewhere that generate income\nwith strong free  cash flow , backed by a solid balance sheet and\na \u201csafer\u201d track record.  Badger Daylighting  Calgary-based Badger Daylighting, which provides excavating\nservices, had flat  revenue  and earnings through the 2009\nrecession and is now expanding, Tardif said. Its  shares   have\nrisen 74 percent in the last five years and fell 1 percent to\nC$28.50 in Toronto.  Another favorite is  DirectCash Payments Inc. (DCI) , a Calgary-\nbased bank machine and prepaid phone-card company that operates\nin Canada, the U.S. and  Mexico . Tardif wouldn\u2019t disclose if he\nowns the stock or plans to buy. It has risen 19 percent this\nyear,  compared  with a 2.3 percent gain in the benchmark S&P/TSX\nComposite Index.  In the oil industry,  Tourmaline Oil Corp. (TOU) , a Calgary-based\noil and gas explorer and producer with a market value of C$4.9\nbillion, is a name that he doesn\u2019t own but would buy at the\nright price.  Tardif said investors shouldn\u2019t expect the same kind of\nreturns managers generated before the global financial crisis.  \u201cIf boring is safe and gives us a decent return, I don\u2019t\nmind calling it boring,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\nwill stay that way forever.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nEric Lam in Toronto at \n elam87@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDavid Scanlan at \n dscanlan@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Enbridge Inc was 24.158519744873047 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Enbridge Inc was ",
