 "context": "The following article called 'Gulf Skips Sukuk in Rush to Borrow: Islamic Finance (Correct)' was published on 2010-11-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n(Corrects to add Albaraka sale in second paragraph in\nstory first published yesterday.)  Persian Gulf issuers are choosing to\nsell non-Islamic bonds instead of sukuk in the borrowing rush\nthat has followed Dubai World\u2019s debt restructuring.  Non-Islamic bond sales from the region may almost double to\n$15 billion this quarter as companies from Qatar National Bank\nSAQ, the country\u2019s largest bank, to Oman-based MB Petroleum\nServices LLC tap the market, investment bank Exotix Ltd. in\nDubai estimates. Saudi Aramco and Total SA\u2019s $1 billion sukuk\nsale and Bahrain-based Albaraka Banking Group\u2019s $200 million\nissuance are the two known deals for the rest of 2010.  The abundance of liquidity in the non-Islamic debt market,\nthe enforceability of investors\u2019 rights in defaults and the\nextra cost associated with Islamic bond documentation are\nsteering issuers away from sukuk, Unicorn Investment Bank BSC\u2019s\nsenior vice president of capital markets, Nida Raza, said Nov.\n2.  \u201cPeople are just taking a quicker, faster execution\nroute,\u201d said Alex von Sponeck, London-based managing director\nat Goldman Sachs International\u2019s investment banking division.\n\u201cWho knows when liquidity dries up again or economic\ninstability can cause markets to shut down again.\u201d  Issuance of Islamic bonds from the six-nation Gulf\nCooperation Council dropped 28 percent in 2010 to $4.5 billion\nafter debt restructuring, defaults and tumbling property prices\nhurt investor confidence, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.\nThat contrasts with a drop of less than 1 percent to $26.8\nbillion in non-Islamic bond issues this year, with fourth-\nquarter sales of $8 billion, the data show.  Planned Sales  Global sukuk sales declined 29 percent to $13.7 billion\nthis year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as four\ndefaults in the past 18 months prompted investors to demand\nhigher returns from property-related issuers. Issuance reached a\nrecord $31 billion in 2007.  Improving risk appetite in the Gulf after Dubai World\u2019s\nagreement with creditors this year to restructure $24.9 billion\nin debt bodes well for sukuk sales in 2011, according to HSBC\nHoldings Plc and Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  \u201cWe continue to expect more issues to come to the market,\nwith the likes of Saudi Arabia leading the way,\u201d Shehzad Janab,\nhead of asset management at Dubai-based Daman Investments PSC,\nwhich has more than 5 billion dirhams ($1.4 billion) under\nmanagement, said in an interview on Nov. 2. \u201cTraditionally, the\nissue with pricing was due to a thin secondary market with sukuk\npriced higher due to the illiquidity; that doesn\u2019t hold as true\nanymore.\u201d  Outperforming Islamic Debt  The difference between the average yield for emerging-\nmarket sukuk and the London interbank offered rate narrowed 106\nbasis points, or 1.06 percentage points, in the second half to\n3.38 percent on Nov. 5, according to the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US\nDollar Sukuk Index.  Non-shariah-compliant issues are still outperforming\nIslamic debt. Bonds in developing markets returned 18 percent\nthis year, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBI Global Diversified Index,\nwhile global sukuk gained 13 percent, according to the\nHSBC/NASDAQ Dubai US Dollar Index. Islamic bonds in the GCC also\nreturned 13 percent, the HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai GCC US Dollar Sukuk\nIndex shows.  The yield on Malaysia\u2019s 3.928 percent Islamic note due in\nJune 2015 was little changed at 2.35 percent today, according to\nprices provided by Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. The extra yield\ninvestors demand to hold Dubai\u2019s government sukuk rather than\nMalaysia\u2019s narrowed seven basis points to 387 last week,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  QNB, MB Petroleum  Qatar National Bank confirmed hiring banks to manage the\nsale of a dollar-denominated bond on Oct. 28. It did not\ndisclose the amount it aims to raise through the issue. MB\nPetroleum\u2019s $350 million notes, the first high-yielding debt\nfrom the region this quarter, may be priced to yield about 11.25\npercent, two people familiar with the sale said Nov.4. Abu\nDhabi-based International Petroleum Investment Co. and First\nGulf Bank PJSC are also planning sales.  Dubai Electricity & Water Authority received orders worth\n$13 billion for $2 billion of debt last month in its largest\ndollar-denominated bond sale. Thirty-eight percent of the\noffering went to European investors, 30 percent to U.S.\ninvestors, and 16 percent each to Asian and Middle Eastern\ninvestors, the company said.  \u201cThe demand is coming from out of the region, so it\u2019s not\nprimarily Islamic in nature, people are looking for yield,\u201d\nDouglas Hansen-Luke, chief executive officer at Robeco Middle\nEast, which manages $200 billion globally, said in a Nov. 3\ninterview. \u201cConventional has rebounded so quickly and companies\nare taking advantage of that.\u201d  \u2018Chasing Yield\u2019  The Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank and Abu Dhabi\nIslamic Bank PJSC, the United Arab Emirates\u2019 second-biggest\nshariah-compliant bank, are the only GCC issuers to have raised\nIslamic debt this quarter.  \u201cThe markets are being heavily driven by opportunistic\nborrowing, rather than credit fundamentals,\u201d said John Bates\nhead of fixed income at Silk Invest Ltd., a London-based fund\nthat specializes in frontier markets in a phone interview on\nNov. 4. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a U.S. dollar investor-base chasing yield\naround the planet and they\u2019re always going to go for the\neasiest, most-liquid assets. Sukuk issues are not as well\nknown.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nCamilla Hall in Dubai at \n chall24@bloomberg.net \nHaris Anwar in Dubai on \n Hanwar2@bloomberg.net .
