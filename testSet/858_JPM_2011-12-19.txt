Banks (BKX) \nalso led declines in U.S. stocks amid concern about tighter\ncapital requirements under proposed international standards.  \u201cA lot of people are calling on the ECB to step in and buy\nmore  government bonds , but that\u2019s the wrong institution to do\nit,\u201d Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee about $209 billion as\nchief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in\nMenomonee Falls, Wisconsin, said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cThey want to stay independent and if they want to retain any\ncredibility as inflation-fighters, they need to have these\ncountries come together and fund\u201d  Europe \u2019s bailout programs and\nthe  International Monetary Fund , he said.  Banks Drop  The  S&P 500  has fallen 4.2 percent in 2011, poised to snap\na two-year rally, amid concern about slower global growth as\nEuropean leaders struggle to solve the region\u2019s debt crisis.\nFinancial shares had the biggest decline in the benchmark\nmeasure this year, tumbling 23 percent.  Citigroup Inc.,  Bank of America (BAC)  Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. tumbled at least 3.7 percent to help lead losses in all 24\nstocks in the KBW Bank Index today. Bank of America dropped\nbelow $5 for the first time since March 2009, closing at $4.99 a\nshare.  Banks should be forced to reveal more data about their\nfinancial reserves so that they can\u2019t conceal poor management\ndecisions and excessive risk-taking, global regulators said.\nLenders should \u201cdisclose the full list\u201d of instruments that\nthey are counting toward meeting their required minimum capital\nlevels, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision said in an e-\nmailed statement today.

ECB Loans  ECB Vice President  Vitor Constancio  said he expects\n\u201csignificant\u201d demand for the central bank\u2019s three-year loans,\nits latest attempt to keep credit flowing to households and\nbusinesses during the debt crisis.  \u201cI cannot put a figure to it, but I would think that it\nwould be significant,\u201d Constancio told Bloomberg Television in\nan interview in Frankfurt today. \u201cIt\u2019s an important instrument\nfor banks. They face very high refinancing needs early next year\nrelated to the repayment of medium-term debt.\u201d  IMF Loans  European finance ministers did agree to bolster their anti-\ncrisis arsenal, channeling 150 billion euros ($195 billion) to\nthe IMF. Four countries not using the euro -- the  Czech\nRepublic , Denmark, Poland and Sweden -- pledged to follow suit,\nLuxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said in an e-\nmailed statement after chairing a teleconference of EU finance\nministers today. Britain refused to commit, in a sign of the\ndifficulty of attracting outside cash to the rescue effort.  Germany  continued to oppose an early decision to raise the\nlimit of 500 billion euros on overall emergency aid. European\nleaders plan to tackle that question by March. Still, the IMF\ninfusion and jump in ECB bond purchases indicated that Europe is\nwielding more money instead of relying on budget cuts alone to\npersuade investors to return to markets scarred by two years of\nburgeoning debt and threatened defaults.  The ECB said it settled 3.36 billion euros ($4.4 billion)\nof bond purchases in the week through Dec. 16, up from 635\nmillion euros the previous week. The central bank will take\nseven-day term deposits tomorrow to absorb the 211 billion euros\nof liquidity created since its bond program started on May 10\nlast year, a practice it employs to ensure the purchases don\u2019t\nfuel inflation.
