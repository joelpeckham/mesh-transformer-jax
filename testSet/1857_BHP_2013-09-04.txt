(BHP) , the world\u2019s\nbiggest exporter of coking coal, said the market for the fuel\nused to make steel remains \u201cchallenging\u201d because of muted\ndemand in some markets and oversupply from rivals.  \u201cThe near-term will be challenging,\u201d Dean Dalla Valle,\npresident of Melbourne-based BHP\u2019s coal business, said at the\nopening of the $1.4 billion Daunia mine in Queensland. \u201cWe\u2019re\nseeing lower prices as a result of subdued demand in some\ntraditional markets and strong supply from some competitors.\u201d  Prices are under pressure because of rising supply after a\nrecovery from flood-affected mines in Queensland, and a slowdown\nin steel demand growth. Falling coal prices and high costs have\nprompted Australian producers including BHP to shutter\noperations and cut staff. Prices are expected to bottom this\nyear, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Coking coal prices for the third quarter settled at $145 a\nmetric ton, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group\nLtd., down from $172 during the three months to June 30 and the\nlowest since 2009 when prices were agreed annually.  The metallurgical coal business, which BHP describes as one\nof its \u201cfour pillars\u201d alongside iron ore and petroleum, has\nreturned to profitability, Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Mackenzie  said last month after flooding and industrial action\naffected the business.  Sale Canceled  BHP, spending $5.3 billion on its Australian coal business\nto expand mines and port facilities, in July canceled the sale\nof the Gregory Crinum mine in Queensland after making\noperational improvements. Growth projects in Queensland will\nboost total coking coal capacity production to 66 million metric\ntons annually, Mackenzie said Aug. 20.  \u201cWe\u2019ll still see a good long-term demand trend for\nmetallurgical coal,\u201d Dalla Valle said.  In Queensland, BHP operates seven mines in the Bowen Basin\nthrough the 50-50 BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance, as well as\ntwo operations through the BHP Billiton Mitsui Coal partnership,\nwhere the company holds an 80 percent stake. The company\u2019s\nDaunia mine will have an annual export capacity of 4.5 million\ntons of coking coal.  BHP last month reported a decline in profit, joining Rio\nTinto Group and Vale SA, as slowing economic growth saps demand\nfor raw materials, dragging down prices. Mackenzie cut  capital\nspending  this fiscal year as investors including BlackRock Inc.\npressure mining companies to defer expansions and acquisitions.  Peabody Energy Corp. in July said it would cut 400\npositions at its Australian coal mines to reduce costs and boost\ncompetitiveness. BHP shut the Gregory mine in Queensland last\nyear, while Anglo American placed its Aquila operation on care\nand maintenance next month because of the outlook for prices.  With a majority of BHP\u2019s 18 major projects nearing\ncompletion, capital spending is set to fall to $16.2 billion for\nfiscal 2014, the company said last month. That compares with\nexpenditure on new projects and expansions of $21.2 billion the\nprevious year.
