 "context": "The following article called 'China\u2019s Output Gains Probably Neared Two-Year Low in Case for Wen Stimulus' was published on 2012-03-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina  may report tomorrow the\nslowest  inflation  in 19 months and industrial-production growth\nnear a two-year low, increasing odds the government will step up\nefforts to stimulate the economy.  Consumer prices probably rose 3.4 percent in February from\na year before, after a 4.5 percent increase in January, while\noutput growth  eased  to 12.5 percent, Bloomberg News surveys of\neconomists indicate. Commerce Minister Chen Deming yesterday\nsignaled that export gains were less than analysts forecast.  Premier  Wen Jiabao \u2019s government this week highlighted plans\nfrom endorsing higher minimum wages to boosting public housing\nthat reduce risks of the slowdown turning into a so-called hard\nlanding. Concern over the magnitude of China\u2019s moderation\ncontributed to Asian stocks surrendering recent gains this week,\nwith a benchmark  gauge  poised to snap an 11-week winning streak.  \u201cGrowth will slide further if the government doesn\u2019t\nincrease fiscal investment,\u201d said Joy Yang, a Hong Kong-based\neconomist at Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd. who previously\nworked at the  International Monetary Fund . The data \u201cwill boost\nthe case for Wen to step up policy measures to bolster growth,\u201d\nshe said.  The benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index snapped the biggest\nthree-day fall since December, rising 0.6 percent today at 11:02\na.m. in  Tokyo . China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained\n0.6 percent at 10:03 a.m. local time after dropping 2.7 percent\nin three days. The yuan weakened a fourth day against the dollar\nto 6.3153.  Options Measure  The cost to protect against losses in China\u2019s biggest\ncompanies is the highest compared with the U.S. since 2008.\nOptions on the 40-member Hang Seng China Enterprises Index,\nwhich includes PetroChina Co. and China Construction Bank Corp.,\nshow investors are increasingly bearish on the gauge of Hong\nKong-traded China shares after it surged as much as 46 percent\nsince October.  The March 9 releases of industrial output, retail sales and\n fixed-asset investment  will be the first this year. The\ngovernment hasn\u2019t given data for January in part because the\nweeklong Chinese New Year holiday distorts data in the first two\nmonths.  Retail sales  probably cooled to a 17.4 percent gain in\nFebruary from 18.1 percent in December, economists\u2019 estimates\nshow. Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households may have\nincreased 20.5 percent in January and February combined,\ncompared with a 24.9 percent gain in the first two months of\n2011.  Wen, 69, opening the nation\u2019s annual legislative meeting on\nMarch 5, announced an economic-growth target of 7.5 percent for\n2012, after setting an 8 percent goal the previous seven years.\nHe signaled leaders want to cut reliance on exports and  capital\nspending  in favor of consumption.  Export Forecasts  Outbound shipments  gained about 7 percent over January and\nFeburary combined, Chen said during a press briefing yesterday.\nNomura Holdings Inc. said the comment indicated exports grew\nonly 18.7 percent, less than any of the 29 estimates in the\nBloomberg News survey before Chen spoke, and Societe Generale SA\nrevised its forecast to 18 percent from 30 percent. The\ngovernment report is due March 10.  Europe \u2019s economy  shrank  0.3 percent in the fourth quarter\nfrom the prior three months. Exports to the region fell about 2\npercent to 3 percent in the January-February period, Chen said.\n\u201cArduous efforts\u201d will be needed to meet a goal of increasing\nChina\u2019s trade by 10 percent this year, Chen said. The target is\nhalf of 2011\u2019s expansion.  Before Chen\u2019s comments, economists had forecast China to\nreport a $5 billion trade  deficit  for February, the first\nmonthly shortfall in a year and only the third since 2005.\n Societe Generale  changed its estimate to a $30 billion deficit\nfrom $5.3 billion. Estimates ranged from a $33.6 billion deficit\nto a $21.6 billion surplus.  Property \u2018Drag\u2019  \u201cFebruary data will be mixed, with downside risks due to\nthe holiday distortion and the drag of property curbs,\u201d said\nZhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in\n Hong Kong .  Zhu said the first quarter may mark a trough for growth in\n2012 as the government eases policy and the global economy\nimproves, helping \u201cdrive a strong recovery\u201d in the second half.\nChen also said the situation for trade may improve in the second\nhalf.  The People\u2019s Bank of China in February  lowered  banks\u2019\nreserve requirements for the second time in three months to\nboost lending and sustain growth.  Inflation in February may have slowed to below the\ngovernment\u2019s annual target for the first time since June 2010,\npartly on easing food costs and the fact that last year\u2019s\nChinese New Year holiday in February boosted spending and prices.\nThe festival fell in January this year, helping drive a higher-\nthan-forecast consumer price gain of 4.5 percent.  Inflation Goal  Wen this year set the inflation goal at 4 percent, the same\nrate as in 2011, and up from 3 percent in 2010.  Producer-price inflation  may have slowed to 0.1 percent\nlast month from a year earlier, the lowest since November 2009,\nfrom 0.7 percent in January, according to the median of 32\neconomist estimates.  \u201cInflation will be a relatively small issue this year,\u201d\n Li Daokui , an academic adviser to China\u2019s central bank, told\nreporters March 6. He forecast annual consumer-price gains of\n\u201caround 3 percent.\u201d  Banks in China may have extended 750 billion yuan ($119\nbillion) of new local-currency loans last month, economists\nestimated after lending grew a less-than-forecast 738 billion\nyuan in January, the smallest expansion in five years for that\nmonth. M2, the broadest measure of  money supply , may have\n increased  12.9 percent in February, compared with 12.4 percent\nin January.  Spending on property and infrastructure may have remained\n\u201csluggish\u201d and cold weather in the first two months of the\nyear may have hindered public-housing construction, Morgan\nStanley economists led by Helen Qiao said in a March 2 report.  That may weigh on growth prospects for developers and\nsteelmakers. Zhu Jimin, head of the China Iron and Steel\nAssociation and also the chairman of Shougang Corp., a Beijing-\nbased steelmaker, this week said nationwide steel output growth\nmay fall by half this year.
