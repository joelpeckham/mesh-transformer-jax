 "context": "The following article called 'Deutsche Bank Drops on Report Jain Will Warn on Trading' was published on 2013-09-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Europe\u2019s biggest\ninvestment bank by revenue, dropped in Frankfurt following a\nreport that one of its co-chief executive officers will warn\nnext week about a decline in the debt-trading business.  The stock fell 2.1 percent to 35.36 euros ($47.81), its\nfirst decline this week. Co-CEO Anshu Jain may tell investors at\na Sept. 25 conference in  London  that third-quarter revenue from\nfixed-income trading lags behind the same period in 2012, the\nFinancial Times reported, without citing anyone.  Global investment banks have seen a slowdown in debt\ntrading, a key portion of their revenue, amid uncertainty about\nthe  Federal Reserve \u2019s plans to reduce the pace of monthly bond-buying. Jain, 50, has previewed earnings at conferences before\nand will probably do so again next week,  Dirk Becker , an analyst\nwith Kepler Cheuvreux, said in an interview today.  \u201cI expect Jain to make a cautious statement on fixed\nincome in the third quarter,\u201d said Becker, who is based in\nFrankfurt and  recommends  buying Deutsche Bank stock. \u201cIt won\u2019t\nbe a terrible quarter, but Deutsche Bank will probably see\nrevenue fall from last year\u2019s quarter.\u201d  Deutsche Bank spokesman  Michael Golden  declined to comment\nwhen reached by phone in Frankfurt today. The company is\nscheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 29.  Jefferies Plunge  Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc have\nindicated to investors that trading revenue for the period\nprobably will be down from a year earlier. Jefferies Group LLC,\nwhose third quarter ended in August, said this week that fixed-income trading revenue plunged 88 percent while equity trading\nfell 28 percent.  Jain is scheduled to speak at a conference hosted by  Bank\nof America Corp. (BAC)  at 2 p.m. in London on Sept. 25. He used two\nsimilar occasions to give investors an indication of revenue in\nthe first and second quarters of this year.  Fed officials have been debating when to slow their $85\nbillion-a-month pace of bond buying, known as quantitative\neasing, as the economy recovers and low  interest rates  prompt\ninvestors to take more risk.  Most economists surveyed by Bloomberg now expect the\ncentral bank to begin tapering asset purchases in December after\nthe Fed decided this week to maintain the pace.  Fed comments in mid-May led some investors to anticipate a\nslowdown in the bond purchases, causing \u201ca broad sell-off in\nJune across most asset classes\u201d and making market conditions\n\u201csubstantially more challenging,\u201d Deutsche Bank Chief\nFinancial Officer  Stefan Krause  said on a July 30 conference\ncall with analysts.
