 "context": "The following article called 'Facebook First-Quarter Profit Drops; Costs Almost Double' was published on 2012-04-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFacebook Inc. (FB) , the social network\nplanning an initial public offering, said first-quarter profit\nfell 12 percent as sales growth slowed and marketing costs more\nthan doubled.  Net income dropped to $205 million in the three months\nthrough March,  Menlo Park , California-based Facebook said\nyesterday in a regulatory  filing . Sales climbed 45 percent to\n$1.06 billion, a slowdown from 55 percent in the December\nperiod.  Expenses surged to $677 million, reflecting higher costs of\nhelping marketers reach Facebook\u2019s growing user base, which\nswelled by one-third to 901 million last quarter. The company\nmay struggle to reach EMarketer Inc.\u2019s projection for 2012 sales\nof $6.1 billion as it awaits the full impact of new tools aimed\nat wringing more money from advertisers, said Debra Aho Williamson, who helped construct the researcher\u2019s estimate.  \u201cFacebook has a pretty steep hill to climb to meet the\nexpectations that we set out,\u201d Williamson said.  Facebook may seek an IPO valuation of $75 billion to $100\nbillion, people with knowledge of the matter have said. The\nupper end of that range would value the company at about 25\ntimes trailing 12-month sales, more than double  Google (GOOG)  Inc.\u2019s\nvaluation when the search-engine operator went public in 2004.  Before last quarter, Facebook\u2019s sales were already\nprojected to gain at a slower rate this year than Google\u2019s at\nthe time of its IPO, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. At\n$6.1 billion, 2012 revenue would be 64 percent higher than the\n$3.71 billion reported in 2011. Google\u2019s revenue more than\ndoubled to $3.19 billion the year it went public.  New Benchmark  Facebook unveiled a new benchmark that showed monthly\nrevenue per user climbed 6 percent to $1.21. The company valued\nits shares at $30.89 apiece at the end of January, up from\n$29.73 at the end of last year.  Facebook , which plans to raise $5 billion in the largest-\never Internet initial public offering, also disclosed new\ninformation about recent acquisitions. To finance the $1 billion\npurchase of Instagram, announced April 9, Facebook used 23\nmillion shares and $300 million in cash.  Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  is rolling out new\nadvertising services to step up competition with Google and\n Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  and generate higher sales from the advertisers eager\nto reach Facebook\u2019s user base. During the first quarter,\nFacebook said it would add mobile advertising along with new ads\nto reach users when they log off the company\u2019s website.  Zynga Revenue  Facebook said 82 percent of its revenue came from\nadvertising last quarter, down from 83 percent in the preceding\nperiod. The company also derived less revenue from gaming\ncompany  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , which contributed 11 percent of the total in\nthe quarter, down from 13 percent a year earlier.  The company said it may extend payments outside of games,\nand charge developers different fees than the 30 percent\ncurrently paid by Zynga and other sellers of virtual goods.  The number of daily active users rose to 526 million, an\nincrease of 41 percent from a year earlier. Facebook\u2019s employee\nbase rose 46 percent to 3,539.  \u201cOur costs are growing quickly, which could harm our\nbusiness and profitability,\u201d the company said in the filing.\n\u201cProviding our products to our users is costly and we expect\nour expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden\nour user base, as users increase the number of connections and\namount of data they share with us, as we develop and implement\nnew product features that require more computing infrastructure,\nand as we hire additional employees.\u201d  The company plans to list on the Nasdaq Stock Market under\nthe symbol FB, according to the regulatory filing.  Sales had risen 55 percent to $1.13 billion in the fourth\nquarter, and net income had climbed 20 percent.
