 "context": "The following article called 'ISE Renews CBOE Automated-Markets Patent Court Fight' was published on 2013-03-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInternational Securities Exchange\nLLC, an electronic options-trading forum, is set to renew legal\nhostilities with  Chicago Board Options Exchange  Inc. in a fight\nover an automated trading patent.  Jury selection began today at the federal courthouse in\nChicago for a trial that U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow told\nthe prospective panelists may last into early April. The case is\none of at least four legal disputes between Deutsche Borse AG-\nowned ISE and  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , the Chicago-based operator of\nthe biggest U.S. options exchange.  \u201cThe evidence will establish that CBOE deliberately copied\nISE\u2019s patented system for executing trades,\u201d New York-based ISE\nsaid in a court filing last month.  Competition is increasing among derivatives-exchange\noperators including NYSE Euronext and  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  ISE\nin a March 1 regulatory filing revealed plans to start a second\noptions market called Topaz which, if approved, would be the\n12th such U.S. forum. Nasdaq OMX owns three of the venues while\nCBOE and  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  have two each.  ISE\u2019s patent scrap with the Chicago Board Options Exchange\nbegan with a complaint filed in federal court in  Manhattan  in\n2006. The case was transferred to Chicago after CBOE counter-\nsued there, seeking a finding of non-infringement.  Lost Profits  ISE seeks a royalty and lost profits, as well as either an\ninjunction barring further infringement or royalties for the\nbalance of the patent\u2019s life. The patent expires in 2019.  Lefkow, in a ruling dated March 10 and posted on the\ncourt\u2019s electronic docket today, said she will bar ISE from\npresenting evidence of pre-suit damages. The New York-based\nexchange failed to comply with a federal \u201cmarking statute,\u201d\nrequiring it to make public its patent claim, the judge said.  \u201cAlthough ISE sufficiently pleaded CBOE\u2019s knowledge of the\npatent and its infringement, ISE did not disclose its theory\nthat it was not required to mark because it did not make or sell\nthe invention after issuance of the patent,\u201d prejudicing CBOE\nas it prepared for trial, Lefkow said.  The statutory punishment for that failure is that damages\ncan only be recovered for that time period after notice of\ninfringement is given, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.  Used Elsewhere  CBOE contends in court papers that ISE did nothing more\nthan acquire a patent for a method that had already been used\nelsewhere.  \u201cAutomating such floor-based trading is far from new,\u201d\nthe  Chicago  exchange\u2019s lawyers said in a pretrial brief filed\nlast month. CBOE argued that the ISE patent claims lack\ninnovation and should be declared invalid.  Lefkow declared the patent invalid in March 2011. A federal\nappeals court reversed that ruling in May.  While the process of selecting eight jurors began today,\nthe judge told candidates for service they won\u2019t begin hearing\nevidence until March 14. Lefkow will hear arguments on still-\npending pretrial motions tomorrow and on March 13, according to\nher ruling.  C2 Options Exchange Inc., an all-electronic exchange owned\nby CBOE Holdings, in August sued ISE seeking a declaratory\njudgment that it too is not infringing the same patent at issue\nin the trial.  Chicago U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in January\ndenied ISE\u2019s bid for dismissal of that complaint. It filed an\nanswer on Jan. 28.  Case Transferred  CBOE, in a separate lawsuit filed in Chicago last year,\naccused ISE of infringing patents related to quote-risk\nmonitoring and quote-modification. That case, in which CBOE\nseeks at least $525 million in damages, has been transferred to\nfederal court in  New York .  An  Illinois  appeals court last year rejected ISE\u2019s bid to\noverturn a court order barring it from providing a forum for\ntrading S&P 500 index options. ISE had been sued by McGraw-Hill\nCos., parent of  Standard & Poor\u2019s , and CBOE, which claims an\nexclusive license to offer S&P 500-based options.  ISE has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review that ruling.  The cases are Chicago Board Options Exchange Inc. v.\nInternational Securities Exchange LLC, 07-cv-00623, and\nInternational Securities Exchange LLC v. Chicago Board Options\nExchange Inc., 07-cv-04709, U.S. District Court, Northern\nDistrict of Illinois (Chicago).
