 "context": "The following article called 'Thai Bankruptcies Rise as Minimum Wage Rolls Out: Southeast Asia' was published on 2013-02-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nConfederate International Co., a\nThai family-owned maker of nightwear, lost a German customer of\n22 years after last month\u2019s  minimum-wage  increase in the\nSoutheast Asian nation raised costs.  \u201cThey stopped talking to us, even though we have done\nbusiness together for a long time,\u201d said Veerayuth Sookhattako,\n57, owner of the Chiang Mai-based company that ships about 80\nmillion baht ($2.7 million) of apparel to Germany and  France \neach year. \u201cI established this company 28 years ago. I don\u2019t\nwant to let it go, but I may need to close down our business by\nthe end of the year if we can\u2019t get new orders.\u201d  Veerayuth isn\u2019t alone. Last quarter, 7,221 Thai companies\nclosed down, 27 percent higher than in the same period a year\nearlier, when the worst floods in 70 years swamped most of the\ncountry. The figure is also more than double the average of\n3,000 in the previous nine years, according to data from the\n National Economic & Social Development Board.   Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra\u2019s government raised the\ndaily minimum wage to 300 baht throughout the country last\nmonth, after a similar increase in April in seven provinces\nincluding Bangkok. Before the increase, minimum wages ranged\nfrom 159 baht in northern Phayao province to 221 baht in Phuket,\naccording to the Labour Protection and Welfare Department.  Government stimulus measures, including the wage rise and\nincreased payments to farmers, come as the country\u2019s\nmanufacturers struggle with a stronger baht and slowing export\ndemand amid a global slowdown.  Baht Strength  \u201cThe problem with the Thai minimum-wage hike is there\nmight be competitiveness issues because this will lead to high\ncosts for firms and if there\u2019s no way to offset these costs, it\ntranslates into higher inflation for consumers,\u201d said Eugene Leow, a Singapore-based economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd.\n\u201cThere\u2019s also some concern about how strong the  Thai baht  is.\u201d  The baht is the biggest gainer this year among 11 widely-\ntraded Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The Bank of\n Thailand  held the  benchmark rate  for a third straight meeting\nthis month even after Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong\nrenewed calls for lower borrowing costs to discourage inflows\nthat boosted the baht to a 17-month high in January.  Wages in Asia almost doubled between 2000 and 2011,\naccording to the International Labor Organization, and workers\nfrom  China  to  Indonesia  have pushed for more pay in recent years\nto counter rising living expenses. The increases will\npermanently increase business costs, forcing companies to boost\nprices, according to a report from HSBC Holdings Plc.  \u2018Fundamental Change\u2019  \u201cLately, far more persistent and permanent costs have shot\nup -- wage pressures are now ubiquitous across  Asia \u2019s\nfactories,\u201d HSBC economists Frederic Neumann and Julia Wang\nwrote in a report last month. \u201cA rise in wages is permanent and\nshould thus prompt a fundamental change in pricing.\u201d  Thailand\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises will suffer\nthe most from higher wages because they\u2019re labor intensive and\ndon\u2019t earn enough to benefit from reduced corporate income tax\nrates, according to the government and the central bank.  Costs for Thai companies will rise 6.39 percent on average\nbecause of the wage increase, according to state planning agency\nNESB. Costs will climb 0.57 percent for large companies, and as\nmuch as 17.8 percent for small companies, it said.  There are more than 2.9 million small and medium\nenterprises across Thailand, according to 2011  government data .\nThey account for 99.8 percent of all businesses in the country\nand generate employment for 9.7 million people, or almost 80\npercent of all jobs. These businesses earn 3.5 trillion baht\nannually, or more than a third of GDP.  Beneficial Effects  Even with factories closing down, Thailand\u2019s unemployment\nrate is still among the lowest in the world, standing at 0.48\npercent in the fourth quarter, down from 0.63 percent in the\nsame period in 2011.  While higher wages will increase costs for businesses and\nboost  inflation , they will also improve the purchasing power of\nconsumers and help bolster economic growth, said  Fred Gibson , a\nSydney-based economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics.  \u201cBy raising the minimum wage, you\u2019re also allowing lower-\nincome households to consume and this will help lift  consumer\nspending ,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend we\u2019re seeing across the\nregion, as governments try and spread the beneficial effects of\ngrowth. Having a higher minimum wage also is one of the steps\nthat helps you transition into higher value-added manufacturing\nbecause there\u2019s more incentives.\u201d  The salary increase boosted labor income by 16.5 percent in\nthe fourth quarter last year, while product prices rose 3.2\npercent, according to NESDB.  Labor productivity  rose an average\nof 2.3 percent in the last 10 years.  Cheap Products  \u201cProductivity rose much slower than wages,\u201d Suwannee\nKhamman, deputy secretary general at NESDB, said yesterday at a\nbriefing in Bangkok. \u201cThis is not good. It means that we will\ncontinue to produce cheap products, while our costs are\nhigher.\u201d  Southeast Asia \u2019s second-largest  economy  grew a faster-than-\nexpected 6.4 percent last year. Gross domestic product is\nforecast by the government to rise 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent\nthis year, with  export growth  predicted to be 11 percent.  For Veerayuth, whose business in  Chiang Mai  employs 140\nworkers, the benefits aren\u2019t yet apparent. \u201cMy clients said\nthey can\u2019t understand why our country raised wages drastically\nlike this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be done step by step.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSuttinee Yuvejwattana in Bangkok at \n suttinee1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nStephanie Phang at \n sphang@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 34.19647216796875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
