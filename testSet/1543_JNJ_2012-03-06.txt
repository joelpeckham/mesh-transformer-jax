(PFE) , the world\u2019s largest\ndrugmaker, sued a unit of Johnson & Johnson, contending it\ninfringes its U.S. patent 5,918,590, which covers pain-relieving\nheat-patch technology.  Pfizer, based in  New York , is seeking unspecified damages\nafter a jury trial and a halt to sales of Fort Washington,\nPennsylvania-based McNeil-PPC\u2019s Precise-brand patch, according\nto a complaint filed in federal court in  Delaware  yesterday.  \u201cMcNeil was aware of the patent\u201d because its number \u201cis\nclearly marked on the packaging of Thermacare, Pfizer\u2019s\ncompeting heat-wrap product,\u201d Pfizer lawyers allege.  Pfizer, with $67.4 billion in sales last year, also makes\nLipitor for cholesterol control. Last month, Pfizer and  Ranbaxy\nLaboratories Ltd. (RBXY)  were sued in an antitrust case in New York\nalleging the drugmakers engaged in an anti-competitive scheme to\ndelay generic Lipitor into the market.  Seema Kumar, a  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  spokeswoman, couldn\u2019t\nimmediately comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Pfizer v. McNeil-PPC, U.S. District Court,\nDistrict of Delaware (Wilmington).  WIPO Says PCT Patent Filings Up, With ZTE Corp. in the Lead  International patent filings under a treaty administered by\na United Nations agency increased 10.7 percent over the previous\nyear, the World Intellectual Property Organization said in a\n statement  yesterday.  A record 181,900 applications were filed in 2011, WIPO\nsaid.  China ,  Japan  and the U.S. accounted for 82 percent of the\nincrease in filings. Applications are filed under the Patent\nCooperation Treaty, which facilitates the process of seeking\npatent protection in multiple countries.  ZTE Corp.

Trademark  Australia Said to Face WTO Complaint Over Ban on Tobacco Logos  Australia  may face a complaint at the World Trade\nOrganization over its decision to ban trademarks and logos on\ntobacco products, according to two people with direct knowledge\nof the matter.  The complaint, which says the plain-packaging law violates\nglobal intellectual-property rules, will probably be lodged with\nthe Geneva-based trade arbiter this month, as soon as this week,\nsaid one person.  Australia is the first country to require identical\ncigarette packaging. As of Dec. 1, 2012, cigarettes there will\nhave to be sold in dark brown packets, with no company logos or\nimages and the same font for all brands.  Imperial Tobacco Group\nPlc (IMP) ,  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  and  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  are\namong companies that have challenged the law, which Australia is\nextending to include cigars and loose-leaf tobacco products.  The law violates \u201cseveral provisions\u201d of agreements\nprotecting intellectual-property rights,  Ukraine  said at a Feb.\n28 WTO meeting on the matter  Countries including Chile, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican\nRepublic, El Salvador, Honduras,  Indonesia , Jordan,  Mexico ,\nNicaragua, Nigeria, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe also say the\nAustralian ban breaks trade rules. They have challenged\nAustralia\u2019s scientific evidence and said the law will\nunnecessarily restrict commerce because the country\u2019s public-\nhealth goal can be met by other means.  The missions of Ukraine, Zimbabwe, Mexico, Indonesia and\nNigeria in Geneva didn\u2019t return calls or declined to comment.  Australia said at the Feb. 28 WTO meeting that it had\n\u201ccomprehensively responded to all the claims made by the\nDominican Republic and others.\u201d  The rule is \u201cnot anti-trade, it\u2019s anti-cancer,\u201d\nAustralian Trade Minister Craig Emerson said in an e-mailed\nstatement yesterday in Canberra. \u201cIt\u2019s in the public-health\ninterests of the Australian people and the Gillard government\nwill never give up on Australia\u2019s sovereign right to look after\nthe health of its people.\u201d  The World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on\nTobacco Control, the first international treaty aimed at cutting\ntobacco use, includes provisions on non-pricing measures to\nlower demand, including regulations on packaging and labeling.  While the treaty doesn\u2019t specifically address the use of\ntrademarked brands or logos, it requires signatories to ensure\nthat packaging and labeling don\u2019t promote a tobacco product by\n\u201cany means that are false, misleading, deceptive or likely to\ncreate an erroneous impression about its characteristics, health\neffects, hazards or emissions.\u201d  WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said on Nov. 23 that\nmajor tobacco companies were harassing governments including\nAustralia, Norway and Uruguay in a bid to overturn cigarette\npackage-labeling rules.  The European Union is also considering plain packaging for\ntobacco products.  EU to Decide on Future of Google Antitrust Probe Next Month  European Union regulators must decide next month on the\nfuture of their antitrust probe into  Google Inc. (GOOG) , the region\u2019s\ncompetition commissioner said.  Joaquin Almunia  said investigators still must define their\nobjections and clarify concerns over the world\u2019s largest search\nengine. Last year he said that the probe focused on whether the\ncompany is a gate keeper to the Internet that can influence\nusers\u2019 behavior.  \u201cNext month I will have to decide how to continue this\ninvestigation,\u201d Almunia said in an interview with Bloomberg HT\ntelevision. \u201cFirst we have to define our objections. We need to\nclarify\u201d the concerns \u201cafter a year-and-a-half of complex\ninvestigation. And we will communicate these to Google and we\u2019ll\nsee what happens.\u201d  Google, based in Mountain View, California, is under\ngrowing pressure from global antitrust agencies probing whether\nthe company is thwarting competition in the market for Web\nsearches. While Microsoft Corp. and partner  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  have\nabout a quarter of the U.S. Web-search market, Google has almost\n95 percent of the traffic in  Europe , Microsoft said in a blog\npost last year, citing data from regulators.  The EU is investigating claims Google discriminated against\nother services in its search results and stopped some websites\nfrom accepting rival ads. Microsoft and shopping-comparison site\nFoundem are among companies that asked for a review of Google\u2019s\nactions.  Investigators should report to Almunia at the end of March\nor the beginning of April on the status of the \u201cvery difficult\nand complex investigation,\u201d he said.  Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels, said the\ncompany continues \u201cto work closely and cooperatively with the\nEuropean commission to explain how our business works.\u201d  For more trademark news, click here.  Copyright  U.S. Files Formal Request With New Zealand to Extradite Dotcom  The U.S. government has formally asked  New Zealand  to\nextradite Megaupload.com founder Kim Dotcom, who was indicted in\n Virginia  on charges of involvement in the country\u2019s biggest\ncopyright infringement conspiracy.  The extradition papers for Dotcom; Finn Batato, the chief\nmarketing officer at Megaupload; Mathias Ortmann, co-founder and\ndirector of the file-sharing website; and Bram van der Kolk, who\noversaw programming at the website, were received at the North\nShore District Court near Auckland on March 2, said Magila\nAnnandale, a New Zealand Ministry of Justice spokeswoman.  Dotcom ran a \u201cMega Conspiracy,\u201d U.S. prosecutors said in\na Feb. 17 revised indictment filed in a court in Alexandria,\nVirginia, accusing him of generating more than $175 million in\ncriminal proceeds from the exchange of pirated film, music, book\nand software files. He faces as long as 20 years in prison for\neach of the racketeering and money-laundering charges in the\nindictment.  The U.S. extradition papers weren\u2019t immediately available\nfrom the North Shore District Court. A judge has to approve\nrequests from people not involved in the case for access to\nfiles after receiving a written application and obtaining views\nof all parties in the matter, Annandale said in an e-mail\nyesterday.  Dotcom, 38, was also charged in the U.S. with five counts\nof criminal copyright infringement and five counts of wire\nfraud. The defendant, who legally changed his family name from\nSchmitz, has denied any criminal misconduct.  He was released from jail on Feb. 22 over objections from\nthe U.S., after Judge N.R. Dawson ruled he wasn\u2019t a flight risk.\nDotcom is restricted to his rented $18 million mansion and\nsubject to electronic monitoring, according to the bail\nconditions.  An extradition hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 20.  For copyright news, click here.  IP Talk  China Proposes Certifying Professionals as Lawyers, Xinhua Says  China\u2019s State Council is seeking public feedback on a\nproposed law that will allow some professionals to apply to\nbecome lawyers, Xinhua News Agency said, citing the Cabinet\u2019s\nLegislative Affairs Office.  Professionals with bachelor\u2019s degrees and at least 15\nyears\u2019 experience in international trade,  intellectual property \nrights, finance, environmental protection, high technology,\njournalism or medical accidents will be eligible under the\nproposed law, the official news service reported.  In 1980, Chinese government regulations defined lawyers as\n\u201cstate legal workers,\u201d and were regarded as civil servants\nworking in legal advisory officers.  It took another 15 years for understanding of the legal\nprofession to evolve to the point at which a 1996 Chinese law\ndefined them as \u201cprofessionals providing legal service to\nsociety,\u201d according to a 2003 doctoral dissertation by\n Professor Ethan Michelson , a social scientist at the University\nof Indiana. By the end of 2002, Beijing had no more state-owned\nlaw offices, Michelson said in his dissertation.  In an  essay  published in 2010 by the Brookings Institution,\nMichelson noted that the legal profession has grown\ndramatically, from only a few thousand in 1979 to almost 150,000\nby 2007.  In a survey he conducted in 2009, whose results are\npublished in the essay, Michelson said of the more than 2,600\nwho responded, 9 percent reported incomes above $73,000, with\nfive reporting annual incomes in excess of $1.5 million.  Some of the lawyers who responded to his survey had only\njunior-college degrees, although most had at least an\nundergraduate degree. Their incomes were relative to the amount\nof education they received.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nVictoria Slind-Flor in Oakland, California, at   vslindflor@bloomberg.net .
