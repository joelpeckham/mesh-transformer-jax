The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA partnership led by Hines and\nAntarctica Capital Real Estate LLC was selected as the buyer of\n11  office properties  owned by the state of California after\nmaking a $2.33 billion offer.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay $1.09 billion of\nbond debt on the buildings and add $1.2 billion to the state\u2019s\ngeneral fund, the  Department of General Services  said in a\nstatement today. California will lease back the offices over 20\nyears, and will no longer be responsible for maintaining,\noperating or repairing the buildings.  \u201cThis sale will allow us to bring in desperately needed\nrevenues and free the state from the ongoing costs and risks of\nowning real estate,\u201d Ron Diedrich, acting director of the\ndepartment, said in the statement.  California went a record 100 days without a budget until\nGovernor  Arnold Schwarzenegger  signed an $87 billion spending\nplan Oct. 8, sparing the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy from\nhaving to issue IOUs for the second year in a row. The most\npopulous U.S. state was the last to enact a budget for this\nfiscal year.  More than 300 bids were received for the buildings, which\ntogether comprise almost 7.3 million square feet (678,000 square\nmeters), according to the department. The properties include the\nSan Francisco Civic Center, Ronald Reagan State Building in Los\nAngeles, Capitol Area East End Complex in Sacramento, Elihu M.\nHarris Building in Oakland and Judge Joseph A. Rattigan Building\nin Santa Rosa.  Completion This Year  Diedrich today notified the state Legislature of the\nagency\u2019s intent to sell the properties. The transaction is\nscheduled for completion by the end of this year, according to\ntoday\u2019s statement.  The acquiring partnership, known as California First LLC,\nwill provide 40 percent of the purchase price and finance the\nbalance with a loan from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. , according to the\ndepartment\u2019s  executive summary  of the deal.
