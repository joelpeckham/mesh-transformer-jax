 "context": "The following article called 'Manhattan Lures REITs Capitalizing on Soaring Rents' was published on 2012-02-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTom Toomey, chief executive officer\nof real estate investment firm  UDR Inc. (UDR) , is betting the best\nrental deal in Manhattan is owning the whole building.  The nation\u2019s third-largest apartment real estate investment\ntrust bought a five-tower apartment complex on Columbus Avenue\nbetween West 97th and 100th streets for about $630 million last\nmonth, with rents from $2,500 for a studio or one-bedroom\napartment to more than $10,000 a month for a penthouse suite.\nIt\u2019s Toomey\u2019s fifth purchase in Manhattan in the past year as\nrents soar and financing difficulties make it harder for\nindividuals to buy.  \u201cFinancing and underwriting are much tighter,\u201d Toomey\nsaid in a telephone interview. With purchases requiring larger\ndown payments, \u201cpeople are going to stay renters for a long\ntime,\u201d said Toomey, who\u2019s based in Highlands Ranch,  Colorado .  Strict lending standards for so-called  jumbo mortgages  have\ncontributed to declining  home buying  across the U.S. by even the\nmost creditworthy borrowers as issuance of the loans has dropped\n68 percent since 2007. Nowhere is that more evident than in\nManhattan, where the median price of a two-bedroom apartment is\nabout $1.2 million, almost twice the limit backed by government-\nsupported mortgage companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac .  Manhattan rents rose 9.5 percent last quarter to an average\n$3,121, Miller Samuel Inc. and Prudential Douglas Elliman Real\nEstate said in a report last month. That\u2019s about three times the\nrate for the 44 largest apartment markets in the U.S., according\nto Marcus & Millichap, a real estate brokerage firm. Manhattan\nrental apartment vacancy rates fell to a four-year low of 0.96\npercent last year, down from 1.2 percent a year earlier and 1.9\npercent in 2009, according to brokerage Citi Habitats. Vacancy\nbottomed in 2006 at 0.76 percent.  Wall Street Pay  \u201cThe key to the strength of the rental market is tightness\nof credit,\u201d Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser  Miller\nSamuel , said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt takes quadruple-A\nbizarre credit requirements to get approved.\u201d  Jumbo loans exceed limits set for government-controlled\nmortgage companies by congress. For  New York  that\u2019s $625,500.  Wall Street\u2019s pay practices are also making it harder to\nbuy, as financial firms increasingly pay bonuses in stock and\ndeferred cash, said Alan Johnson, managing director of\ncompensation consultant Johnson Associates Inc.  Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc.\nhave all reduced senior investment bankers\u2019 pay for last year as\nrevenue slows. Morgan Stanley is capping immediate cash bonuses\nat $125,000, people with knowledge of the move said last month.  Shorter Commitment  \u201cIt\u2019s not a great sign for the financial sector\ncontributing to purchasing apartments because there\u2019s no sense\nof urgency to buy,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cRentals are a much shorter\ncommitment.\u201d  Renters outnumber homeowners in the country\u2019s largest\ncities including New York,  Los Angeles  and  Chicago . More than 77\npercent of Manhattan\u2019s occupied units were rented in the decade\nended 2010, compared with nearly 23 that were owned, data from\nthe Census Bureau showed.  Nationally, the  home ownership  rate fell 1.1 percent to\n65.1 percent from 2000 to 2010, the largest decrease since the\nGreat Depression, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Falling\n home prices  have discouraged some homebuyers.  The  S&P/Case-Shiller index  of property values in 20 cities\nfell 4 percent in December from a year earlier. Values are down\n34 percent from a July 2006 peak.  Low vacancy rates and rents that are likely to continue\nclimbing this year have made apartments the \u201cdarling\u201d of\ncommercial real estate, according to Ryan Severino, economist at\nresearch firm Reis Inc.  Apartment Indices  The  Bloomberg REIT Apartment Index (BBREAPT)  of 16 publicly traded\nlandlords returned 10 percent in the past year, including\nreinvested dividends, compared with returns of 6.8 percent for\nthe  Bloomberg REIT Index (BBREIT)  and 5.2 percent for the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index.  Equity Residential (EQR) , the largest U.S. apartment\nREIT, returned 11.2 percent in the past year, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg, and UDR gained 10.8 percent.  Toomey said in August that the REIT planned to invest as\nmuch as $1.8 billion in Manhattan apartment buildings. Its most\nrecent purchase, about 700 apartment units at Columbus Square on\nthe Upper West Side, was a joint venture with  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the\nbiggest U.S. life insurer.  They partly funded the purchase with $302.3 million of 10-\nyear fixed- and floating-rate debt from  Fannie Mae , the\ngovernment-supported mortgage company, UDR said in a statement\nlast month. The loans pay 3.8 percent interest.  That compares with a rate of 4.85 percent for a 30-year\njumbo mortgage to an individual in  New York (ILMJNY)  and 4.73 percent\n nationally , according to Bankrate.com data. For conforming\n Freddie Mac (NMCMFUS)  loans, rates are 3.95 percent, after falling to 3.87\npercent this month, the lowest in records dating to 1971.  Housing Limits  Lenders have been wary to issue mortgages for non-\nconforming loans including jumbos since the housing market\nstarted falling in 2006 and losses on mortgage securities\npropelled the nation into the worst financial crisis since the\nGreat Depression.  For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the conforming limit is\n$625,500 in high-priced markets such as New York,  San Francisco \nand the Florida Keys, compared with $417,000 for most of the\nrest of the country. The  Federal Housing Administration (FHAVARM$) , a\ngovernment agency with the goal of expanding ownership for\n\u201cunderserved\u201d communities, according to its website, will\ninsure loans up to $729,750 in New York.  Banks and mortgage lenders issued $110 billion in jumbo\nloans last year, up 5.8 percent from 2010, according to  Guy Cecala , publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. The market has\ncontracted from $348 billion in 2007 after peaking in 2003 at\n$650 billion.  Origination Volumes  Mortgage origination overall was down 17 percent year-over-\nyear to $1.35 trillion, the lowest in over a decade, according\nto Cecala.  Lenders and bankers, no longer able to package jumbo loans\nand sell them to investors, are required to have enough capital\nto carry non-conforming debt on their books until maturity.  \u201cSome don\u2019t have the ability to keep it on their balance\nsheets,\u201d Monte N. Redman, president of bank holding company\nAstoria Financial Corp., said in a telephone interview.  FHA loans are also harder to get in Manhattan, and aren\u2019t\navailable at all for co-op apartments, because borrowers\npurchase shares in the building\u2019s management company instead of\nbuying the property itself. The FHA does limited lending for\ncondominiums, units individually grouped into a cluster. It\ninsured 107 mortgages for condos in Manhattan last year,\ncompared with 90 in 2010 and 42 in 2009, the FHA said.  Manhattan Sales  Manhattan co-op and condominium sales totaled 2,011 in the\nfourth quarter, 12.4 percent less a year earlier, according to\nMiller Samuel and Prudential.  Non-conforming loans nationally accounted for nearly 2\npercent of all purchase applications last year, up 33 percent\nrelative to 2010, according to the  Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation \u2019s monthly profile of state and national mortgage\nactivity.  Those loans have tougher standards such as high  interest\nrates  and down payments ranging from 25 to 40 percent, according\nto Mike Fratantoni, vice president of research for the Mortgage\nBankers Association.  \u201cThey\u2019re only available to the best credit borrowers,\u201d\nFratantoni said.  Financing a purchase with loans above government limits\nwon\u2019t get easier until the secondary market grows an appetite\nfor jumbo loans, according to Miller of Miller Samuel.  The secondary market comprises mortgage bankers, savings\nand loan associations and large private investment institutions\nthat buy mortgages from primary lenders or investors.  MBS Sales  There are signs of revival for mortgage-backed securities,\naccording to Jan Scheck, managing director at DE Capital\nMortgage, a New York-based mortgage consulting firm.  Redwood Trust Inc. (RWT) , a real estate investment trust based in\nMill Valley,  California , has completed four sales of bonds\ntotaling about $1 billion tied to new U.S. home loans since\n2010, according to Mike McMahon, managing director of Redwood,\nwhich specializes in jumbo loans.  Wells Fargo & Co ., the nation\u2019s largest home lender, plans\nto trim credit requirements this year as it aims to increase its\nloan volume, according to Greg Gwizdz, sales manager for the\neastern U.S. for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. The bank reduced the\ncost of loans over $2 million last month and is lowering post-\nclosing requirements for cash reserves, he said.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a fair amount of demand, we have a strong\nappetite and we\u2019re doing a lot of volume,\u201d Gwizdz said in a\ntelephone interview.  Jumbo Origination  Wells Fargo funded $13.7 billion in non-conforming loans\nacross the nation for the nine month period ending September,\nthe San Francisco-based lender said. In Manhattan its volume of\nloans without government backing increased 56 percent from a\nyear earlier.  For now, building owners don\u2019t have time to wait for the\nrebound.  William Beaver House  in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District\nwas mostly empty in 2010, two years after the 47-story\ncondominium tower was built. It\u2019s almost 90 percent occupied\nafter owner CIM Group converted the units to luxury rentals\ncosting more than $8,000 a month for a three-bedroom. A down\npayment on a $3 million apartment at William Beaver would range\nanywhere from $750,000 to over $1 million, per jumbo loan\nstandards. A pre-recession down payment, averaging 20 percent or\nless, would have cost $600,000.  \u201cWithout the conversion, the condos wouldn\u2019t have sold or\nwould have sold at half the price,\u201d Bob Scaglion of Rose\nAssociates, the company\u2019s manager, said. Eventually, the owners\nwant to put the condominiums back on the purchase market,\naccording to Heather McDonough, broker for Prudential Real\nEstate who works to sell William Beaver units.  \u201cThe rentals are in high demand,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cIn a\nfew years, maybe it will be different.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nChristine Harvey in New York at \n charvey32@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nRob Urban at \n robprag@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Redwood Trust, Inc. was 5.947166442871094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Redwood Trust, Inc. was ",
