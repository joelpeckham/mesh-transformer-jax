 "context": "The following article called 'Weber Says Euro Crisis to Persist as ECB Fails to Bring Calm' was published on 2012-10-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUBS AG (UBSN)  Chairman and former European\nCentral Bank Governing Council member  Axel Weber  said the euro\nregion\u2019s festering debt crisis will \u201ccontinue to linger\u201d as\nthe ECB fails to ease market disquiet and volatility.  \u201cWhile many expect that the ECB\u2019s strong action would\nbring stability to financial markets, the risk is that the\npattern of short-term rallies and long-term uncertainty will\nstay with us for some future,\u201d Weber said today at an\ninvestment conference in Moscow organized by VTB Capital.  The program of unlimited bond purchases unveiled last month\nby ECB President  Mario Draghi  has sought to stamp out the crisis\nby limiting government borrowing costs and giving debt-ridden\nnations the chance to fix their economies and preserve the euro.\nWeber, who during his tenure at the ECB opposed the central\nbank\u2019s previous bond-buying plan, predicted the monetary union\nwill overcome the crisis even as there won\u2019t be a \u201cquick fix.\u201d  \u201cThe underlying fundamental perspective is not great at\nthe moment,\u201d Weber said. \u201cAusterity programs which are badly\nneeded to restore market confidence and create fiscal room to\nmaneuver will take a toll on the economy. So this will be a\nrough patch that  Europe  is going through, but it will get\nbetter.\u201d  Confidence, Unemployment  Economic confidence in the region unexpectedly fell in\nSeptember after the euro-area economy contracted 0.2 percent in\nthe second quarter, and indicators have since shown signs of a\ndeepening slump. Unemployment in the economy of the 17 nations\nusing the euro reached the highest on record and factory output\ncontracted for a 14th straight month in September.  \u201cThe Europeans just need longer to work it out,\u201d Weber\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s very complex: this is a ship in storm, it has 17\ncaptains.\u201d  Weber, who is also a former president of  Germany \u2019s\nBundesbank, said \u201cthe known flaws of the European construction\ncannot be reversed,\u201d nor do they merit \u201cinfinite\u201d discussion.  \u201cWe are where we are,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no argument\nthat anything could be changed now. What needs to be done is\ncourageous political decisions need to be taken, forceful\nreforms need to be enacted, and the construction that we have\nneeds to be made to work.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nScott Rose in Moscow at \n rrose10@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nBalazs Penz at \n bpenz@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 7.892948627471924 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
