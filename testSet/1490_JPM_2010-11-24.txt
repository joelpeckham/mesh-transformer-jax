 "context": "The following article called 'Orders for U.S. Durable Goods Unexpectedly Decline' was published on 2010-11-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOrders for U.S. goods meant to last\nseveral years unexpectedly decreased in October, raising the\nrisk that companies will scale back on investments in new\nequipment.  Demand for so-called  durable goods  dropped 3.3 percent, the\nbiggest plunge since January 2009, after a revised 5 percent\njump in September that was larger than previously estimated,\nfigures from the Commerce Department showed today in Washington.  A slowdown in capital spending would deprive the world\u2019s\nlargest economy of a source of strength just as household\npurchases are starting to accelerate. While overseas demand is\nhelping companies like  Rockwell Automation Inc. , there may be\nless of a contribution to growth from inventory rebuilding in\ncoming months.  \u201cBusiness investment is slowing, but the numbers we got\ntoday might overstate the magnitude,\u201d said  Brian Jones , an\neconomist at Societe Generale in New York, who said the first\nmonth of the quarter typically shows weakness.  Other government reports today showed consumer spending\nrose in October for a fifth month and applications for\nunemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level since\nJuly 2008.  Household purchases advanced 0.4 percent after a 0.3\npercent gain in September that was larger than previously\nestimated, Commerce Department figures showed. Incomes climbed\n0.5 percent and the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of\ninflation was little changed, capping the smallest 12-month gain\nsince records began five decades ago.  Jobless Claims  Jobless claims declined by 34,000 to 407,000 in the week\nended Nov. 20, according to Labor Department figures. The median\nprojection of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a\ndrop to 435,000. The total number of people receiving\nunemployment insurance decreased to the lowest in two years, and\nthose on extended payments also fell.  Stock-index futures extended earlier gains after the\nreports. The contract on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\nmaturing in December rose 0.7 percent to 1,186.70 at 9:20 a.m.\nin New York. Treasury securities fell, sending the yield on the\nbenchmark 10-year note up to 2.83 percent from 2.78 percent late\nyesterday.  Economists forecast total durable goods orders would\nincrease 0.1 percent, according to the median of 74 projections\nin a Bloomberg News survey. Estimates ranged from a drop of 2.7\npercent to an increase of 4.5 percent.  Excluding Transportation  Excluding transportation,  bookings  decreased 2.7 percent.\nThey were forecast to increase 0.6 percent, according to the\nBloomberg survey.  Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft,\nconsidered a proxy for future business investment, fell 4.5\npercent after a 1.9 percent gain in September. The government\nhad previously estimated such orders dropped 0.2 percent in\nSeptember.  The swings in orders for capital goods may reflect calendar\neffects that the government isn\u2019t able to capture with its\nseasonal adjustments.  \u201cI would expect the trend to be slowing a little bit in\nthe core numbers but I wouldn\u2019t get too concerned if you see a\nlittle bit of weakness in them,\u201d  Michael Feroli , chief U.S.\neconomist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York, said before the\nreport. \u201cYou have gotten very strong growth in the first of\nthis year and it may be hard to sustain that pace.\u201d  Non-Defense Capital Goods  Shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft,\nused in calculating gross domestic product, decreased 1.5\npercent after a 1 percent gain in September.  The so-called core capital goods figures typically are\nweaker at the start of the quarter, particularly for October,\nsaid  Aaron Smith , a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics Inc.\nin West Chester, Pennsylvania.  The world\u2019s largest economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual\npace from July through September, the Commerce Department said\nyesterday. Corporate profits increased 2.8 percent during the\nthird quarter and were up 28 percent from the same three months\nlast year.  Today\u2019s report counters others suggesting factories are\nsupporting growth in the fourth quarter.  Federal Reserve  The Federal Reserve last week said factory output increased\nin October by the most in three months. The 0.5 percent increase\nin the manufacturing component of the industrial production\nreport was led by makers of autos, computers and communications\ngear.  Foreign sales are a bright spot for factories and exports\nin September rose to the highest level in two years, according\nto Commerce Department data released Nov. 10. Some businesses\nare responding to greater demand from the U.S. and abroad by\nreplacing aging equipment and bringing more parts of their\nplants online.  Rockwell Automation, the maker of factory software, said it\nsees interest rising in large-scale plant projects for full-\nproduction lines in developed markets, a sign that those\neconomies may be picking up steam.  \u201cThese are projects that are significant expansion in\nproduction capacity or new lines,\u201d Chief Executive Officer\n Keith Nosbusch  said in an interview Nov. 9. \u201cThese would be\nlarger capital spending investments,\u201d which means those markets\nhave a more positive outlook on their future.
