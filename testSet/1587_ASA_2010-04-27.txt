 "context": "The following article called 'Iran Adds Three Supertankers to Fleet Storing Crude, Matching Peak of 2008' was published on 2010-04-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIran, OPEC\u2019s second-biggest oil\nproducer, added three supertankers to its fleet of vessels\nstoring crude, matching a similar program in 2008 that helped\nfreight rates to triple, ship tracking data show.  \n At least 15 such vessels are idling in the Persian Gulf,\nGulf of Oman and Gulf of Suez, according to data from the ships\ncollected by AISLive Ltd. The tankers can store a combined 30\nmillion barrels of oil, more than a week of national output.  \n Two years ago, Iran used as many as 15 tankers for storage,\nconstricting vessel supply and helping to more than triple\nfreight rates in less than three months.  \n Iran is likely storing oil because of weakening demand as\nrefineries across Asia, accounting for almost two-thirds of\nglobal demand for supertankers, carry out maintenance. National\nIranian Tanker Co., which operates the supertankers, also has a\nladen suezmax tanker idling off Iran, ship-tracking data show. A\nsuezmax can hold about 1 million barrels of oil.  \n \u201cThey don\u2019t want to shut down their production,\u201d said\nOle-Rikard Hammer, an analyst at Pareto Securities ASA in Oslo\nwho\u2019s tracked tanker markets for more than two decades. \u201cThe\nrefining clients are buying less because of maintenance and the\nIranians seem to prefer to keep oil in floating storage.\u201d  \n The discount on Iran Heavy crude compared with Oman and\nDubai petroleum is at its widest in more than a year, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. The discounts on Iran\u2019s Forozan,\nSoroosh and Norooz crudes have also widened.  \n Widening Discounts  \n Calls made after normal business hours to Ahmad Qalebani,\nmanaging director of National Iranian Oil Co., and to Mohammad\nSouri, managing director of National Iranian Tanker Co., weren\u2019t\nanswered. Ali Asghar Arshi, NIOC\u2019s manager of international\naffairs, wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment.  \n National Iranian Tanker has a fleet of 28 supertankers,\naccording to Lloyd\u2019s Register-Fairplay data on Bloomberg. The\nremaining 13 carriers are all either moving or have been at\ntheir present locations for less than two weeks, according to\nthe tracking data.  \n The extra vessels now storing are the Davar, Daylam and\nHatef, according to the data. The Harsin has been added into the\ntotal again. It entered the Gulf of Suez in early March,\ncircling for about a month before moving north. It then circled\nfor two more weeks before moving south again. It was discounted\nfrom the last tally because it was moving at the time. It is now\ncircling again in about the same position as in early March.  \n Charter rates for supertankers sailing to Japan from Saudi\nArabia, the route that\u2019s used to settle freight derivatives,\nfell 3.2 percent to 92.22 Worldscale points today, according to\nthe London-based Baltic Exchange. Returns from the voyage lost\n6.8 percent to $51,331 a day.  \n Suezmax rental income advanced 3.6 percent to $47,223 a\nday, according to the exchange. Aframaxes that transport\n650,000-barrel cargoes slipped 11 percent to $8,537 a day.  \n\n \nTanker         Location       Since          Capacity\nNajm           Iran           Jan. 4         2 million\nHaraz          U.A.E.
