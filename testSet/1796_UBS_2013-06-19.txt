 "context": "The following article called 'China Swaps Gain Most in Five Years on Prolonged Cash Squeeze' was published on 2013-06-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina\u2019s one-year interest-rate swap\nrose by the most in five years as the central bank refrained\nfrom adding funds to the financial system to ease a cash squeeze,\ncausing demand to fall at a government debt auction.  The  finance ministry \u2019s sale of 30 billion  yuan  ($4.9\nbillion) of 10-year bonds today drew bids for 1.43 times the\namount on offer, the least since August 2012. The People\u2019s Bank\nof China asked lenders to submit orders for 14-day reverse-repurchase agreements and 28-day repurchase contracts this\nmorning, according to a trader at a primary dealer required to\nbid at the auctions. The PBOC has refrained from using reverse\nrepos, which inject funds, since Feb. 7.  \u201cThe cash shortage may get even worse before the quarter-end because banks will have to hoard cash to meet loan-to-deposit ratio requirements,\u201d said Chen Qi, a strategist at UBS\nSecurities Co. in  Shanghai . \u201cThe central bank probably won\u2019t\ncome out to intervene unless there is a sharp decline in\neconomic growth and large capital outflows.\u201d  China \u2019s one-year swap, the fixed cost needed to receive the\nfloating seven-day repo rate, jumped 41 basis points to 4.39\npercent as of 3:11 p.m. in Shanghai, according to data compiled\nby Bloomberg. That was the biggest gain since June 2008 and the\nhighest level since September 2011.  Inflows Wane  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank\nfunding availability, increased 138 basis points, or 1.38\npercentage points, to 8.20 percent, a weighted average compiled\nby the National Interbank Funding Center shows. It touched 8.21\npercent earlier, the highest since June 2011.  The finance ministry sold the 10-year notes at a yield of\n3.50 percent, according to a trader at a  finance company  that\nparticipates in the auctions. That compares with the median\nestimate of 3.47 percent in a Bloomberg News survey and 3.38\npercent at the previous sale on May 22.  Yuan positions at local financial institutions accumulated\nfrom sales of foreign exchange, an indication of capital inflows,\nrose 66.86 billion yuan in May, the central bank reported June\n14, the smallest increase since November.  Monetary loosening would lead to more fund outflows and\naffect the foreign-exchange market, the Financial News reported\ntoday, citing an unidentified person. The PBOC also gauged\ndemand for 91-day bills tomorrow, according to the trader.  Chinese regulators are forcing trust funds and wealth\nmanagers to shift assets into publicly traded securities as it\nseeks to curb lending that doesn\u2019t involve local banks, known as\nshadow banking.  Market \u2018Disappointed\u2019  \u201cThe market is disappointed by the lack of reverse repos\nfrom the PBOC,\u201d said  Frances Cheung , a strategist at Credit\nAgricole CIB in  Hong Kong . \u201cThe liquidity squeeze stems from\nless inflows and policy makers\u2019 own policy to crack down on\nshadow banking, so the PBOC may be reluctant to use short-term\ntools to help.\u201d  Fitch Ratings  said in a statement yesterday that the cash\nshortage reflects the move to reduce shadow banking, a measure\nthat will ultimately slow economic growth.  New home prices rose in 69 of the 70 Chinese cities tracked\nby the government in May, defying lending curbs, an official\nreport showed yesterday. China may expand property tax trials to\nmore cities \u201csoon,\u201d the China Securities Journal reported\ntoday, citing unidentified people. Beijing, Shenzhen, Nanjing,\nHangzhou and Qingdao have drafted property tax trial plans, the\nreport said.
