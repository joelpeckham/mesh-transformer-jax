 "context": "The following article called 'Pound Rallies to 3-Month High as Construction Data Boosts Rate-Rise Bets' was published on 2011-02-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe pound rallied to a three-month\nhigh against the dollar after a report showed the U.K.\nconstruction sector returned to growth, adding to speculation\nthe  Bank of England  will have room to raise interest rates.  Sterling appreciated against all but two of its 16 most\nactively traded peers and two-year gilt yields climbed to the\nhighest level since June 2009. A gauge of building activity\nbased on a purchasing managers\u2019 survey rose to 53.7 in January\nfrom 49.1 the previous month, Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said. That was\nhigher than the 49.5 estimate in a Bloomberg survey and above\n50, which indicates an expansion.  \u201cThe market is still focused on rate-hike expectations so\na strong number will give some momentum to calls for higher\ninterest rates,\u201d said Chris Walker, a foreign-exchange\nstrategist at UBS AG in  London . \u201cThat provides some upside.\u201d  The pound advanced as much as 0.6 percent to $1.6230, the\nstrongest level since Nov. 5 and the third-straight day of\ngains, before trading at $1.6169 at 5:13 p.m. in London.\nBritain\u2019s currency gained 0.5 percent to 85.21 pence per euro.  Market speculation has intensified that the Bank of England\nwill be forced to raise interest rates this year to quell\ninflation that has exceeded its 2 percent limit for more than a\nyear, reaching an eight-month high of 3.7 percent in December.\nMonetary Policy Committee member  Martin Weale  joined  Andrew Sentance  in voting for a rate increase at the group\u2019s Jan. 13\nmeeting on concern that inflation may become entrenched.  Sterling Futures, Bonds  Short-sterling futures fell, pushing up the implied yield\non the contract expiring in December by nine basis points to\n1.7 percent, the highest level since July. The rise in the\nyield, which is used to gauge central bank rate expectations,\nshowed investors increased bets that monetary policy makers will\nraise borrowing costs this year.  U.K. two-year government bonds fell for a third day, with\nthe yield on the 4.5 percent gilt due March 2013 rising 10 basis\npoints to 1.5 percent, the highest since June 2009, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. The security fell 0.225, or 2.25\npounds per 1,000-pound ($1,617) face amount, to 106.15.  Ten-year yields rose six basis points to 3.76 percent.  \u201cWe\u2019re quite positive on sterling because we think the BOE\nis going to hike and that will provide support to the\ncurrency,\u201d said Thanos Papasavvas, the London-based head of\ncurrency management at Investec Asset Management Ltd., which\noversees about $70 billion.  Inflation \u2018Problem\u2019  The money manager expects the central bank to raise its key\ninterest rate twice this year to 1 percent by the end of 2011\nwith the first increase likely to occur \u201csome time in the\nsummer,\u201d said Papasavvas. The brokerage does not make currency\nforecasts though it is \u201coverweight the pound,\u201d he added.  \u201cInflation is going to be a problem as commodity prices\ncontinue to go up,\u201d said Papasavvas.  Oil traded near a 28-month high today, with the contract\nfor March delivery climbing as high as $91.78 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Crude touched $92.84 a barrel on\nJan. 31, the highest intraday price since Oct. 7, 2008.  The U.K. 10-year breakeven rate, a market indicator of\ninvestors\u2019 inflation expectations derived from the yield gap\nbetween nominal and index-linked bonds, rose two basis points to\n3.23 percent, the highest level since April last year.  Calls for higher U.K. interest rates may be tempered by\ngovernment spending cuts, the largest since World War II, that\nare aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit from an estimated 10\npercent of gross domestic product in the year through March to\n1.9 percent by 2015. The cuts, which include the loss of 330,000\npublic-sector jobs and reduced investment, show the government\nis pursuing \u201cexcessive austerity,\u201d Nobel Prize-winning\neconomist  Joseph Stiglitz  said at a conference in Moscow today.  Slowing Growth  Central Bank Governor Mervyn King last week dismissed\naccelerating inflation as temporary, saying the government\u2019s\nspending cuts and slowing economic growth would curb price\npressures. A Jan. 25 report showed the U.K. economy unexpectedly\nshrank by 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  The U.K.\u2019s monetary policy makers will raise the main\ninterest rate by 25 basis points in the fourth quarter to 0.75\npercent with no further action anticipated this year, according\nto the median estimate of economists polled by Bloomberg.
