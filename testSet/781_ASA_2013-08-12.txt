 "context": "The following article called 'Norway Fund Betting on \u2018Quite High\u2019 China Growth Rate' was published on 2013-08-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe head of the world\u2019s biggest\nsovereign wealth fund said investing in  China  hasn\u2019t lost its\nallure even after economic growth slowed.  \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed that there has been a change in perception\nabout Chinese growth in the years coming,\u201d  Yngve Slyngstad ,\nchief executive officer of the $760 billion Government Pension\nFund Global, said in an Aug. 9 interview in Oslo. \u201cHowever, the\ngrowth that is expected by the authorities is still quite high.\nWe still have confidence that long-term prospects for China are\nquite good.\u201d  A report last week showed that China\u2019s industrial output\nrose more than estimated in July, adding to signs that economic\ngrowth may start accelerating. Larger-than-forecast rebounds in\nexports and imports and rising gauges of manufacturing and\nservice industries have also signaled the world\u2019s second-largest\neconomy will meet Premier Li Keqiang\u2019s economic growth target\nfor this year of 7.5 percent.  Norway\u2019s wealth fund, which got its first capital in 1996\nto invest the country\u2019s oil wealth outside its borders, lost 5.9\npercent on its stock investments in  emerging markets  in the\nsecond quarter, in part because of speculation of weaker growth\nin China, it said last week. The fund is undergoing a shift in\nstrategy to capture more global growth. It is moving asset\nallocation away from Europe as emerging markets in Asia and\nSouth America gain a bigger share of global output.  China\u2019s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 2.4\npercent, the biggest one-day gain since July 11, to 2101.283.  China Investments  Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore \u2019s wealth fund and the\nbiggest foreign investor in Chinese banks, also said last month\nthat it\u2019s not concerned by a cash crunch that caused Chinese\nmoney-market rates to soar and pushed stocks to a four-year low.  Norway  held 10 percent of its stocks in emerging market\ncountries at the end of June, up from 9.9 percent in December.\nSome 2 percent were invested in China, up from 1.7 percent in\nDecember. That compares with 31 percent in the U.S. and 14\npercent in the U.K. At the end of last year, the last time the\nfund divulged all its holdings, it had 303 investments in\nmainland China.  The fund aims to double its investment in emerging markets\nto 20 percent, Slyngstad said.  Catching Up  \u201cOur ownership in emerging markets is roughly 20 percent\nlower than our average ownership in developed markets, so you\ncan assume that we have to increase emerging markets\nproportionally just to catch up,\u201d he said.  Emerging market equities and bonds also slid in the\nquarter, and about $4.2 trillion was erased from the value of\nglobal equities over a month after Federal Reserve ChairmanBen S. Bernanke in May signaled that policy makers could pare\nstimulus should the world\u2019s largest economy show sustained\nimprovement. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slumped 9 percent\nin the second quarter.  In total, the $760 billion fund rose 0.1 percent, or 17\nbillion kroner ($2.9 billion), in the period, helped by U.S. and\nJapanese stocks. Stocks rose 0.9 percent, while bond investments\ndropped 1.4 percent. Real estate investments rose 3.9 percent.  Slyngstad said that the drop in emerging market shares was\nadvantageous for the fund since it\u2019s building up its positions.  Europe\u2019s biggest equity investor, which gets its guidelines\nfrom the government, held 63.4 percent in stocks in the period,\nup from 62.4 percent in the first quarter. Its bond holdings\nslid to 35.7 percent from 36.7 percent of the fund while real\nestate comprised 0.9 percent. It\u2019s mandated to hold 60 percent\nin stocks, 35 percent in bonds and 5 percent in real estate,\nwhile allowing for fluctuations. The fund mostly follows global\nindexes, with some leeway to stray from those benchmarks.  Biggest Holdings  Slyngstad said the increase in the equity portion was more\na reflection of pessimism on bonds than optimism over stocks.  The fund\u2019s largest stock holding at the end of the quarter\nwas in  Nestle SA. (NESN)  The largest bond holding was in U.S.\nTreasuries.  Norway generates money for the fund from taxes on oil and\ngas, ownership of petroleum fields and dividends from its 67\npercent stake in  Statoil ASA (STL) , the country\u2019s largest energy\ncompany. Norway is western Europe\u2019s largest oil and gas\nproducer. The fund, which has an average holding of about 1.2\npercent of the world\u2019s listed companies, invests abroad to avoid\nstoking domestic inflation.  Limited Spending  The government uses money from the fund to cover budget\ndeficits. Though use is limited to 4 percent, the amount of\nmoney that figure represents is growing. The oil fund has\nquadrupled in size since 2005 and will grow by 50 percent by\n2020, the government estimates.  Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said today the government\nshould limit spending of the fund to 3 percent to prevent the\neconomy from overheating.  \u201cSignificant changes in the oil fund, like the strong\ngrowth we are now seeing, shouldn\u2019t feed directly through to\ndomestic use,\u201d Stoltenberg said on state radio NRK.  The government deposited 58 billion kroner of petroleum\nrevenue into the fund in the second quarter. The return exceeded\nby 0.3 percentage point the benchmark set by the Finance\nMinistry.  The investor has been taking on more risk as it expands\nglobally. It first added stocks in 1998, emerging markets in\n2000 and real estate in 2011 to boost returns and safeguard\nwealth.
