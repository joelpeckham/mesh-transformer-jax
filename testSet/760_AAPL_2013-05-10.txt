The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. Defense Department expects\nto clear  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  mobile devices for use on its networks early\nnext week, a Pentagon spokeswoman said.  The move would give Cupertino, California-based Apple the\nchance to eventually compete for military market share with\nBlackBerry, the Pentagon\u2019s dominant smartphone supplier, and\n Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which gained the department\u2019s\ncertification earlier this month.  An approval next week would allow government-issued devices\nrunning Apple\u2019s newest mobile operating system, iOS 6, to access\nmilitary networks, said Alana Johnson, a spokeswoman for the\nPentagon\u2019s Defense Information Systems Agency.  Widespread adoption of Apple products by the military could\nonly occur after the Pentagon builds a mobile device management\nsystem to secure the devices, she said in an e-mail.  Separately, the Commerce Department\u2019s  National Institute of\nStandards and Technology  on May 3 granted Apple\u2019s iOS 6 a\ncertification known as the  Federal Information Processing\nStandard  for protecting sensitive data, Michael Cooper, a\nmanager in the agency\u2019s computer-security division, said in a\nphone interview.  Agencies that bought Apple mobile devices prior to the\nsecurity approval were required to use a third-party application\nto comply with federal security requirements, Cooper said. The\ninstitute\u2019s certification gives departments the ability \u201cto go\nout and buy these products off the shelf and know that they\u2019re\ngetting security capabilities built in that meet government\nstandards,\u201d Cooper said.
