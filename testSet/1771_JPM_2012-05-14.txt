 "context": "The following article called 'Melco Leads ADRs Record Losing Streak on Growth: China Overnight' was published on 2012-05-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChinese equities  fell for an eighth\nday in New York, sending the benchmark index to the longest run\nof declines on record, after a cut in local banks\u2019 reserve\nratios failed to alleviate concerns of economic slowdown.  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) , a Macau Casino operator,\nsank 9.6 percent, leading the retreat on the  Bloomberg China-US\nEquity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese companies in the U.S.\nThe gauge tumbled 2.4 percent to 95.40.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC) ,\n China \u2019s fourth-largest coal producer, dropped 5.1 percent to\ntrade at the widest discount to its shares in Hong Kong in more\nthan a week, after prices of the fuel retreated for the first\ntime in three years.  Chinese policy makers  lowered reserve requirement ratios  on\nMay 12 for a third time since November after reports last week\nshowed industrial production, retail sales and trade grew in\nApril less than analysts forecast. Stocks tumbled in  Europe  and\nthe U.S. on concern a potential exit of Greece from the single\nEuropean currency may disrupt financial markets and derail\nglobal growth.  The reserve ratio cut is \u201cnot enough to get people\nenthusiastic,\u201d Nicholas Field, who helps oversee $23 billion of\nemerging market assets at Schroders Plc, said in a phone\ninterview from London. \u201cThe growth trajectory has been\ndisappointing. A lot of bad news has been priced in. It won\u2019t\ntake much to get a rally, but we are not there yet.\u201d  The Bloomberg China-U.S. Index\u2019s eight-day decline was the\nlongest losing streak since at least 2005 when Bloomberg started\ntracking the data.  China ETF Sinks  The IShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the biggest Chinese\nexchange-traded fund in the U.S., retreated 1.7 percent to\n$34.74. The  Shanghai Composite Index of mainland stocks  slid 0.6\npercent to a three-week low. The  Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX)  of\nU.S. shares declined 1.1 percent as Greece\u2019s impasse in forming\na new government fuels speculation the nation may leave the euro\nregion.  China\u2019s reserve-ratio cut, effective May 18, reduces the\nrequired level against deposits by 50 basis points to 20 percent\nfor major banks and 18 percent for smaller institutions. The\nmove will probably release 450 billion  yuan  ($71 billion) into\nthe financial system, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  China Southern Airlines Co. (ZNH) , the nation\u2019s biggest carrier\nby passenger numbers, declined 3.9 percent to $22.01, the most\nin a month. China warned its tourists last week to avoid\n\u201cunnecessary\u201d travel to the Philippines amid a dispute between\nthe two countries over an island in the  South China Sea .  Gaming Revenue  Melco Crown fell to $13, the lowest level in a month. Macau\ngaming revenue over the first 13 days of this month may be about\n28 billion patacas ($3.5 billion),  Harry Curtis , an analyst at\nNomura Securities International Inc., said in a note today. It\ncompared with Nomura\u2019s estimate of 29 billion patacas.  American depositary receipts of Yanzhou Coal dropped to\n$17.78, trading 2.3 percent lower than its equivalent shares in\n Hong Kong . The price of Chinese coal for power stations\nretreated for the first time in three years for May, according\nto the China Coal Transport and Distribution Association.  Focus Media Holding Ltd., (FMCN)  a Shanghai-based outdoor\nadvertising company, tumbled 7.6 percent to $21.51, the lowest\nlevel since Jan. 31.  \u2018Disaster\u2019  A government report last week showed China\u2019s  industrial\nproduction  increased at the slowest pace since 2009, while\nretail sales grew the least in more than a year. China\u2019s gross\ndomestic product growth slowed to 8.1 percent in the first\nquarter, the lowest pace in almost three years.  Banks including Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\npared their growth forecasts for China following the April\neconomic data releases. Citigroup has cut its estimate for GDP\ngrowth this year to 8.1 percent, from an earlier forecast of 8.4\npercent.  \u201cAnything less than 7.5 percent GDP growth would border on\na disaster,\u201d Michael Mullaney, who helps manage $9.5 billion as\nchief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust in Boston, wrote by\ne-mailed response. \u201cMaterial stocks as a whole will continue to\nsuffer with any incremental weakness.\u201d  Of the 25 companies in the China-US index that have\nreported earnings since April 1, 11  have fallen short  of\nanalysts\u2019 forecasts, including Yanzhou Coal and  China Telecom\nCorp. (CHA) , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u2018Still Unclear\u2019  Sixteen companies in the China-US index are scheduled to\nrelease first-quarter results this week, including  Sina Corp. (SINA) \nand  Ctrip.com International Ltd. (CTRP) , according to data compiled by\nBloomberg.  China started cutting its  reserve ratio  in December after\nboosting it nine times since November 2010, while holding off on\nlowering  interest rates . The Bloomberg China stock index has\ndropped 0.7 percent since the first reserve cut was announced on\nNov. 30, while  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , which owns the nation\u2019s\nlargest real estate website, has added 21 percent.  \u201cThe question for investors is what will the government do\nnext,\u201d Elena Ogram, who manages $50 million in emerging market\nassets, including Chinese stocks, at Bank am Bellevue AG in\nZurich, said by phone. \u201cLonger term, money will flow and\nsectors such as real estate and industrials stand to benefit.\nBut for the moment, it\u2019s still unclear what the authorities plan\nto do with this new pool of money.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nYe Xie in  New York  at \n yxie6@bloomberg.net ;\nLeon Lazaroff in New York at \n llazaroff@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTal Barak Harif at \n tbarak@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 28.276485443115234 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
