 "context": "The following article called 'Canada Natural Gas Discount at Five-Year High as Storage Fills' was published on 2013-09-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanadian natural gas traded at the\nwidest discount to U.S. prices in almost five years as storage\nlevels in western  Canada  approached capacity.  Regional gas  storage  reached 469.2 billion cubic feet last\nweek, or 97 percent of the capacity surveyed by energy\ninformation firm Canadian Enerdata Ltd. A change in short-term\ntolls on the country\u2019s largest natural gas pipeline in July\nincreased demand for storage. A boost to exports from flooding\nin Colorado is ending, said  Martin King , an analyst with\nFirstEnergy Capital Corp.  Gas shipped from the Alberta AECO hub  closed  yesterday at\n$1.85 per million British thermal units less than the U.S.\nbenchmark natural gas price at  Henry Hub  in  Louisiana . It was\nthe largest discount since Sept. 25, 2008, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cWith storage full and people reluctant to send gas down\nthe Mainline because of the higher short-term tolls, plus\nColorado production coming back and a lull in demand from the\nU.S., prices could be weak for several weeks yet,\u201d King said in\na phone interview from Calgary.  Prices fell in July after pipeline company  TransCanada\nCorp. (TRP)  won approval from regulators to raise short-term tolls on\nits cross-country natural gas Canadian Mainline System to get\nshippers to sign up for long-term contracts.  Many producers responded by putting more gas into storage\nrather than shipping it, though the pace of injections is\nbeginning to slow, said Enerdata President Richard Zarzeczny.  No Room  \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough room and they realize they\nare going to bump up against capacity and the storage operators\nmust be putting some kind of limits on the injection rate,\u201d\nZarzeczny said. \u201cThe fact that it has nowhere to go is what\u2019s\ndriving the price down.\u201d  Some extra Canadian gas probably went to  Colorado  as\nflooding there starting last week shut down local production,\nKing said, although that outlet will disappear as Colorado\noutput returns to normal.  U.S. appetite for natural gas from Canada typically drops\nat this time of year as lower temperatures mean less air-conditioner use. American  demand  last year declined by 6.75\nbillion cubic feet a day, or 10 percent, between July and\nSeptember, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration.  King said Canadian gas prices could be weak into October,\nuntil winter heating demand picks up.  \u201cOnce we get some real space-heating demand, then we kind\nof hit the reset button, storage starts coming down and prices\nwill come back,\u201d he said.  Last year, Canadian storage peaked at 472.5 billion cubic\nfeet on Oct. 20, compared with the maximum of 482.7 billion,\naccording to Enerdata.
