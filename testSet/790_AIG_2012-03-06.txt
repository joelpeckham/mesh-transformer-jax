 "context": "The following article called 'AIA Shares Decline After $6 Billion AIG Sale: Hong Kong Mover' was published on 2012-03-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAIA Group Ltd. (1299) , the third-largest\nAsia-based insurer by market value, fell the most in more than\nfive months after  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  sold $6\nbillion worth of its shares to help repay a government bailout.  AIA  declined  8.4 percent to HK$26.75, the most since Sept.\n22 and outstripping the 2.2 percent fall in the city\u2019s benchmark\nHang Seng Index. New York-based AIG sold 1.72 billion shares of\nthe Hong Kong-based insurer at HK$27.15 each to institutional\ninvestors yesterday and ceased to be AIA\u2019s controlling\nshareholder, AIA said in an e-mailed statement today.  The sale reduces uncertainty about when and how AIG will\nexit its remaining holdings of the Asian insurer after it sold a\nmajority stake via its initial public offering in October 2010\nto help repay the $182.3 billion bailout. The shares declined\ntoday after the sale was priced at the lower end of a target\nrange and 7 percent below AIA\u2019s closing price on March 2.  \u201cAIG\u2019s stake in AIA has been an overhang since the day\nwhen AIA went  public , given its enormous size,\u201d said Wang Lei,\nwho helps manage about $40 billion of assets as co-fund manager\nof Thornburg International Value Fund in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico .  The AIA stock, offered at HK$27.15 to HK$27.50, was the\nlargest share sale globally excluding rights issues this year,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies and their\nshareholders raised more than $58 billion from initial public\nofferings and secondary share offerings globally this year,\naccording to the data.  Hang Seng Index (HSI) \u2019s volume more than doubled its 30-day\n average  to 3.9 billion shares today, amid the selloff of AIA\nshares. About 1.9 billion AIA shares  changed  hands today,\ncompared with the daily average of 27.9 million shares this year\nthrough Mar. 2.  Exiting AIA  The shares sold by AIG represented a 14 percent stake in\nAIA and were priced at a 7 percent discount to the Hong Kong\ncompany\u2019s closing price on March 2. AIG is restricted from\nselling its remaining 18.6 percent holding until Sept. 4, the\nU.S. insurer said in a separate statement.  AIG was rescued in September 2008 after the collapse of the\nsubprime housing market and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\ntriggered credit rating downgrades of the insurer. It has repaid\nmuch of the government bailout through asset sales. The Treasury\nstill holds about three-quarters of the company\u2019s stock and\nother AIG-related assets, backed by collateral including the AIA\nstake.  AIG sold about two-thirds of the Hong Kong-based life\ninsurer in the 2010 IPO. Its stake before the latest share sale\nhad a market value of about $15 billion. Proceeds from the\nlatest sale will be used to lower $8.4 billion AIG owes the\nTreasury to redeem interests in special-purpose vehicles related\nto its rescue.  Reducing Uncertainty  There is a general expectation that AIG will sell its stake,\nsaid John Pearce, Melbourne-based chief investment officer of\n UniSuper Management Pty Ltd. , which manages about $30 billion of\npension assets.  \u201cSo the quickest they exit their position, the better as\nit reduces uncertainty,\u201d Pearce said in an e-mail.  As a result of yesterday\u2019s sale, Jeffrey Hurd and Jay Wintrob, two AIG-nominated non-executive directors, have\ninformed AIA of their plans to resign from its board, the Hong\nKong-based company said in the statement.  AIG has divested more than $50 billion in assets to repay\nthe government rescue, including non-U.S. life insurers and a\nconsumer lender. The firm sold a $500 million stake in\nBlackstone Group LP in a block trade last week, according to a\nperson familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified\nbecause he wasn\u2019t permitted to speak about the transaction.
