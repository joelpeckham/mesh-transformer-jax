 "context": "The following article called 'Sinochem Said to Be Likeliest Rival to BHP Potash Bid' was published on 2010-09-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSinochem Group, China\u2019s largest\nfertilizer trader, has emerged as the likeliest bidder to rival\nBHP Billiton Ltd.\u2019s $40 billion offer for  Potash Corp. of\nSaskatchewan Inc. , three people familiar with the matter said.  Chinese authorities chose Sinochem as the country\u2019s\npotential bidder and are allowing the Beijing-based company to\nbegin piecing together an offer that would likely involve taking\na majority stake in Potash Corp., the people said. Sinochem\nwould prefer to involve Canadian pension funds or other Canadian\ninvestors to create more support for an offer, said the people,\nwho asked to remain anonymous because the talks are private.  Potash Corp., the world\u2019s largest producer of its namesake\ncrop nutrient, last month rejected Melbourne-based BHP\u2019s $130-a-\nshare bid as too low and said it\u2019s seeking other offers. A bid\nby state-controlled Sinochem would indicate China\u2019s desire to\nstop BHP, the world\u2019s largest mining company, from controlling\nmore commodity supplies to the country.  \u201cThe main issue is how to ensure this could be a good\ninvestment with reasonable returns as the potash cycle has\nbottomed out,\u201d said  He Wei , an analyst at BOCOM International\nHolding Co. by phone from Beijing. \u201cPotash is a strategic asset\nto China.\u201d  The board, management and advisers of Saskatoon,\nSaskatchewan-based Potash Corp. determined Sinochem will\nprobably be the only other bidder, said one of the people.\nPotash Corp.\u2019s advisers have been in regular contact with\nSinochem\u2019s advisers, which include Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche\nBank AG, the people said.  Government Objections  Bill Johnson, a spokesman for Potash Corp. in Saskatoon,\ndeclined to comment. Li Qiang, spokesman for Sinochem, wasn\u2019t\nimmediately available. Calls to the Ministry of Commerce and the\nNational Development and Reform Commission, the Chinese\nministries involved in approving the deal, weren\u2019t answered.  By including Canadian investors, Sinochem may have a better\nchance of approval by Canadian regulators than previous attempts\nby Chinese state-owned groups to buy foreign companies. Cnooc\nLtd., China\u2019s biggest offshore energy producer, abandoned its\n$18.5 billion bid for Unocal Corp. in 2005 after opposition from\nU.S. lawmakers.  A Sinochem bid would \u201cbe a test of how open Canada really\nis for investments,\u201d said  Saxon Nicholls , a fund manager at\nHerschel Asset Management Ltd. in Melbourne who helps oversee\n$785 million.  No Details  While both companies\u2019 advisers have been in talks, the two\nsides haven\u2019t discussed at length either valuations or the exact\nstructure for a potential deal, said one of the people. Nor have\nboth sides discussed specific parties that would take a minority\nstake in Potash Corp. as part of a deal, the person said.  While Potash Corp. hasn\u2019t given Sinochem a timeline in\nwhich to get a deal done, the Chinese company still has a few\nweeks to line up financing and partners, the people said.  Potash Corp.  shares  closed at $146 in New York Stock\nExchange composite trading on Sept. 24, indicating investors\nexpect a bid higher than BHP\u2019s.  The Australian company\u2019s offer may not proceed because it\u2019s\nunlikely to overpay and there\u2019s little chance that a competitor\nmay emerge, Citigroup analysts led by London-based  Heath Jansen \nsaid in a Sept. 20 report.  A Chinese offer would have to overcome the objections of\nSaskatchewan Energy and Resources Minister  Bill Boyd  who said\nSept. 2 that offers by state-owned enterprises wouldn\u2019t be in\nthe interest of the Canadian province.  Rivals Stay Away  Alberta Investment Management Corp., the $66 billion\nCanadian pension fund known as AIMCo, said Sept. 3 it isn\u2019t\ninterested in an offer for Potash Corp. after Chief Executive\nOfficer  Leo de Bever  said unidentified Chinese investors had\napproached it about joining a bid.  Sinochem is listed as a key state-owned company under\nChina\u2019s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration\nCommission of the State Council. It is China\u2019s biggest\nchemicals trader, fourth-largest oil company, and also has\ninterests in real estate and finance, according to its  website .  Potash has watched in recent weeks as one after another of\nthe world\u2019s biggest mining companies have distanced themselves\nfrom a bid.  Asked about buying Potash Corp. in an Aug. 26 interview in\nBrisbane,  Tom Albanese , the CEO of Rio Tinto Group, the world\u2019s\nthird-largest mining company, said, \u201cour first priority is\norganic growth.\u201d Analysts at UBS AG who met with him about the\nsame time said he is focused on smaller-sized acquisitions.  Brazil\u2019s Vale SA, the world\u2019s largest iron ore producer,\nsaid last month it wasn\u2019t pursuing a bid for a fertilizer\ncompany and that it would invest $12 billion by 2014 to boost\nits own output of the nutrient.  And at Teck Resources Ltd., Canada\u2019s largest diversified\nmining company, Senior Vice President  Ronald Vance  said at a\nconference this month that Potash is \u201cnot something we\u2019ve spent\na lot of time thinking about, frankly.\u201d  Teck last year sold a 17 percent stake to China Investment\nCorp., a sovereign wealth fund.
