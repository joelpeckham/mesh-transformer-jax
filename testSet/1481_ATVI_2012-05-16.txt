Patent  AstraZeneca Antitrust Fine Should Stand, EU Court Aide Says  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) , the U.K.\u2019s second-biggest drugmaker,\nshouldn\u2019t get a further reduction in an antitrust fine of 52.5\nmillion euros ($67.5 million), an adviser to the European\nUnion\u2019s highest court said.  Jan Mazak, the advocate general to the EU\u2019s Court of\nJustice, said the tribunal shouldn\u2019t re-examine a reduction of\nthe penalty, according at a non-binding opinion yesterday.  According to a 2005 antitrust decision, the company misled\npatent officials and flouted antitrust rules to block a generic\nversion of its Prilosec heartburn medicine. Prilosec was the\nworld\u2019s best-selling drug in the late 1990s.  In 2010, a lower court ruling cut AstraZeneca\u2019s fine from\nthe 60 million euros initially levied by EU regulators.  \u201cThe General Court correctly examined all the elements\nrelevant to the calculation of the fine,\u201d Mazak said in the\nopinion. The higher court shouldn\u2019t \u201csubstitute, on grounds of\nfairness, its own assessment\u201d to replace the legal reasoning\nunderpinning the previous ruling.  Mazak also advised the court to reject challenges from\nregulators, AstraZeneca and the European Federation of\nPharmaceutical Industries and Associations, or EFPIA, an\nindustry group.  The European Commission, the region\u2019s antitrust regulator,\nhas said AstraZeneca blocked cheaper versions from 1993 to 2000\nto keep prices high. AstraZeneca provided the patent offices in\n Belgium , Denmark,  Germany , the Netherlands,  Norway  and the U.K.\nwith incorrect data to extend patent protection on Prilosec,\naccording to the EU.  AstraZeneca is \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the legal adviser\u2019s\nopinion that its appeal should be dismissed, said  Sarah\nLindgreen , a spokeswoman for the company. AstraZeneca takes\n\u201ccompliance with all laws seriously\u201d and has \u201ca fundamental\ncommitment to doing business in an ethical and proper manner,\u201d\nshe said in an e-mail.  The case is  C-457/10  P AstraZeneca v Commission.  Novartis, Pfizer\u2019s Wyeth Seek Delay in Hemophilia Patents Case  The diagnostics unit of  Novartis AG (NOVN)  and  Pfizer Inc.

Trademark  Austria, Slovenia to Settle Smoked Sausage Squabble, APA Reports  Austria  is set to settle a dispute over  plans  by its\nsouthern neighbor Slovenia to  protect the name  of a sausage\npopular in both nations, the Austrian Press Agency reported.  Austria\u2019s Agriculture Minister Nikolaus Berlakovich and his\nSlovene colleague Franc Bogovic reached a compromise in the\ndispute, APA said, citing the Austrian ministry. An experts\u2019\ncommission will meet next week to work out the deal, the agency\nreported.  Slovenia will pursue its plan to restrict the right to sell\nthe smoked pork sausage under its traditional name --\u201cKranjska\nklobasa\u201d in Slovenia or \u201cKrainer Wurst\u201d in Austria -- under\nEuropean Union regulations that also protect Italian  Parma ham \nor Greek  Feta cheese . Under the deal the ministers reached,\nAustrian producers would still be allowed to use the name\nKaesekrainer for a variety of the sausage that contains bits of\ncheese and is the most popular in Austria.  Austria and Slovenia, both part of the Austro-Hungarian\nEmpire before World War I, are embroiled in several disputes\nover their common cultural heritage. A 56-year debate over\nminority rights for ethnic Slovenes in southern Austria ended\nwith a deal for dual-language road signs only last year.  Nationalist Austrian politicians including the late Joerg Haider objected to the use of some motifs on Slovenia\u2019s euro\ncoins, arguing Slovenia was misusing Austrian symbols. Austria\ngained a protected status like the one sought for the sausages\nby Slovenia for  pumpkin seed oil , which is equally popular and\ntraditional in Slovenia.

(ATVI)  is seeking to delay a trial\nagainst the creators of its blockbuster game \u201cCall of Duty:\nModern Warfare 2\u201d to bring in a new lead lawyer as the possible\ndamages it faces have ballooned to $1 billion.  Activision asked California Superior Court Judge Elihu Berle in Los Angeles in a filing May 14 to postpone the May 29\ntrial date for 30 days so that its new attorney,  Beth Wilkinson ,\ncan get prepared.  \u201cModern Warfare 2,\u201d was released in November 2009, and\nbroke all sales records in the entertainment industry, selling\n4.7 million copies in the U.S. and U.K. Activision, based in\nSanta Monica, California, surpassed Electronic Arts, based in\nRedwood City, California, as the biggest U.S. video-game\npublisher by revenue in 2009.  Activision contends Electronic Arts conspired with Jason\nWest and Vince Zampella, the developers of \u201cModern Warfare 2\u201d\nas early as July of 2009 to disrupt its \u201cCall of Duty\u201d\nfranchise, according to Activision\u2019s December 2010 amended\ncross-complaint. The company fired the two men in 2010.  Activision has agreed to pay $42 million to a group of\nformer employees who left in 2010 after West and Zampella were\nfired and who filed their own lawsuit for unpaid bonuses and\nroyalties for their work on \u201cModern Warfare 2,\u201d a person\nfamiliar with the matter said.  The payment of the so-called first-quarter launch bonuses\naren\u2019t a settlement and the group of 40 former employees are\nstill part of the case going to trial, said the person who\ndidn\u2019t want to be identified because the payments haven\u2019t been\ndisclosed in a public record.  Bruce Isaacs, a lawyer for the former employees, declined\nto comment on the payments.  At a hearing, Richard Kendall, a lawyer for Electronic\nArts, said \u201cActivision had the gears in motion already to fire\nthese guys well before EA surfaced in any way as communicating\nwith West and Zampella or any of their representatives.\u201d  The case is West v. Activision, SC107041, California\nSuperior Court (Los Angeles County).  For more, click here.  Deals  Amylin Said to Attract Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Sanofi in Sale  Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Amylin received regulatory approval for Bydureon, a once-\nweekly formulation of its earlier diabetes drug Byetta, in\nJanuary, and the therapy may draw $1.5 billion in peak annual\nsales in the U.S., according to Robyn Karnauskas, an analyst\nwith Deutsche Bank.
