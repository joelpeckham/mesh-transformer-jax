The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRange Resources Corp. and other\nnatural-gas drillers paid a  Pennsylvania  family $750,000 to\nsettle claims the companies were contaminating their water,\naccording to unsealed court records.  MarkWest Energy Partners LP (MWE)  and  Williams Cos. (WMB) \u2019s Williams\nGas unit joined in the June 2011 agreement, which included the\ntransfer of Chris and Stephanie Hallowich\u2019s home in Hickory,\nPennsylvania, and payment of $750,000, according to court\nrecords unsealed in Common Pleas Court in  Washington  County.  The settlement terms were included among more than 900\npages of documents Common Pleas Court Judge Debbie O\u2019Dell-Seneca\nordered unsealed yesterday after rejecting the companies\u2019\narguments that such a move threatened their right to privacy.  In resolving disputes with homeowners from  Texas  to\nPennsylvania, gas drillers have often demanded secrecy in\nexchange for buying their properties, delivering fresh water or\npaying out a settlement.  Environmental groups such as Earthjustice praised O\u2019Dell-\nSeneca\u2019s ruling, saying it would help to shed light on the\nhealth risks of fracking. Range Resources, which fought the\nrelease, said yesterday through a spokesman that it welcomed the\ndisclosure.  Energy Production  Fracking, in which water, sand and chemicals are shot\nunderground to break apart rock and free trapped natural gas,\nhas brought a boom in energy production to Pennsylvania, Texas\nand  Colorado , and lowered natural  gas prices .  The process has been the target of complaints from\nlandowners and farmers, who say leaks from holding ponds, spills\nand underground ruptures have led to contamination of their\nwater.  The Hallowichs filed notice to sue Range and other gas\ndrillers in 2010, claiming the drilling operators and gas-\nprocessing facilities failed to ahere to Pennsylvania\nenvironmental law for air, water and soil, according to court\ndocuments.  Drilling on land adjacent to their property polluted their\nwell and caused them to suffer burning eyes, sore throats,\nsevere headaches and other symptoms from toxic gas, according to\nthe records.  The Hallowichs reached the settlement in 2011 and agreed\nwith the gas drillers to keep the records confidential. Unlike\nmost settlements, the deal required court approval because their\nminor children were parties to the case. That put the settlement\nin court, where newspapers and public interest groups challenged\nan order sealing the case.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Hallowichs received\n$544,820. Their two children got $10,000 apiece with the rest\ngoing to attorneys\u2019 fees, according to court documents.  The case is Hallowich v.  Range Resources Corp. (RRC) , 2010-3954,\nCourt of Common Pleas of Washington County, Pennsylvania\n(Washington).
