 "context": "The following article called 'Silver Powering 20 Million Homes as Glut Subsides: Commodities' was published on 2012-01-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRecord industrial demand for silver\nand resurging investor interest is diminishing a supply surplus,\ndriving the metal used in everything from solar panels to\nbatteries into its best start to a year in almost three decades.  Manufacturers will use 15,415 metric tons, 2.5 percent more\nthan in 2011 and reducing the glut by 41 percent to 3,297 tons,\n Barclays Capital  estimates. Investors may buy 2,000 tons through\nexchange-traded products, after selling 1,300 tons last year,\nMorgan Stanley predicts. Prices will average $37.50 an ounce in\nthe fourth quarter, 13 percent more than now, the median\nestimate in a Bloomberg survey of 13 analysts shows.  The metal rallied 22 percent since closing at an 11-month\nlow in December, entering a  bull market  on mounting confidence\nthat another global  recession  will be avoided even as the  World\nBank  and  International Monetary Fund  cut their growth forecasts.\nPrices had plunged 44 percent in eight months, making it the\nmost volatile of any metal tracked by Bloomberg, as expansion\nslowed from  Europe  to  China , crimping demand for commodities.  \u201cSilver got hammered and now we\u2019re into a phase where it\nwill do quite well,\u201d said  Dan Smith , an analyst at Standard\nChartered Plc in London, and the second-most accurate price\nforecaster tracked by Bloomberg Rankings in the past eight\nquarters. \u201cAppeal comes from its widespread use in both\nindustry and investment. I think it\u2019s relatively cheap.\u201d  Standard & Poor\u2019s  The commodity advanced 19 percent since Dec. 31 to $33.15,\nthe best start to a year since 1983. The  Standard & Poor\u2019s  GSCI\nTotal Return Index of 24 commodities rose 2.3 percent and the\n MSCI (MXWD)  All-Country World Index of equities 5.6 percent. Treasuries\nreturned 0.3 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  This year\u2019s anticipated gains in silver will mean record\nprofit for  Coeur d\u2019Alene Mines Corp. (CDE)  and  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , analyst\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Economies may still pose the biggest threat to the rally.\nThe IMF cut its 2012 forecast on Jan. 24 to 3.3 percent from 4\npercent and warned that Europe\u2019s debt crisis threatened to\nderail the world economy. The World Bank reduced its estimate by\nthe most in three years on Jan. 18, to 2.5 percent from 3.6\npercent. Global industrial production will expand 2.3 percent,\nfrom 4.9 percent in 2011, Macquarie Group Ltd. predicts.  The 0.5 percent contraction in the 17-nation euro region\nseen by the IMF may curb demand for imported goods. Chinese\nexports rose 13.4 percent in December from a year earlier, the\nslowest pace since February, according to customs data. The\nnation imported 235 tons of silver in December, 36 percent less\nthan the average over the past two years, the data show.  Industrial Demand  \u201cIn the face of weak industrial demand, the short-term\ninvestment argument is not entirely convincing,\u201d said David\nJollie, an analyst at Mitsui & Co. Precious Metals Inc. in\n London  and the most accurate forecaster in the London Bullion\nMarket Association\u2019s 2011 price survey. \u201cIt\u2019s much more\ndifficult to get people to invest for the long term in times of\neconomic uncertainty.\u201d  For now,  speculators  are getting more bullish.  Hedge funds \nand other money managers more than doubled wagers on higher\nprices this year, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data\nshow. They held 16,034 futures and options in the week ended\nJan. 24, the most since mid-September. The most widely held\noption gives the owners the right to buy silver at $40 by June,\ndata from the Comex in  New York  show. The three biggest holdings\nare all  call options  at 21 percent or more above prices today.  Investors added 196 tons to their ETP holdings this month,\ntaking the total to 17,492 tons valued at $18.64 billion, within\n7 percent of the record reached in April, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. They also bought 6.082 million ounces\n(189 tons) of American Eagle silver coins, the most in a year,\ndata on the U.S. Mint\u2019s website shows.  Kodachrome Film  Those sales are whittling away the supply glut as\nindustrial consumption strengthens. Global solar-panel\ninstallations increased capacity by 70 percent last year,\ncreating enough generating power to supply about 20 million\nhomes, according to the European Photovoltaic Industry\nAssociation. The metal is also used in electrical conductors,\nwood preservatives and alloys, compensating for a slump in\nphotographic film demand.  Eastman Kodak Co. (EK) , based in Rochester, New York, said in\n2009 it would stop making Kodachrome film after more than seven\ndecades and on Jan. 19 filed for bankruptcy. Demand for silver\nfrom photographic-film makers slid at least 66 percent in the\npast decade, the Washington-based Silver Institute estimates.  Gold Ratio  Silver may still be cheap relative to gold, with a price\nratio of 52.2, down from 57.4 in December. It averaged 32.4 in\n1980, when silver reached a record $50.35 in New York trading.\nNelson and William Hunt of  Dallas  were convicted eight years\nlater of conspiracy for attempting to manipulate prices and were\nordered to pay $130 million.  In inflation-adjusted terms, that peak would be equal to\n$138.31 as of last year, according to a calculator from the\nFederal Reserve Bank of  Minneapolis .  Crystalline silicon solar panels use as much as 0.12 grams\nof silver per watt, and as much as 40 grams go into a 32-inch\nplasma television, according to VM Group, a London-based\nresearch company. Electronic-equipment manufacturing will expand\n5 percent this year, according to  Los Altos , California-based\nresearcher Henderson Ventures in a December report.  Coeur d\u2019Alene , which gets about 69 percent of its revenue\nfrom silver, will report profit of $241.50 million this year,\ncompared with an estimated $120.25 million in 2011, according to\nthe mean of four analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nShares of the Idaho-based company gained 16 percent since the\nstart of January.  Most Accurate Forecaster  Fresnillo will report net income of $988.7 million this\nyear, compared with an estimated $945 million in 2011, the mean\nof six estimates shows. Shares of the Mexico City-based company\njumped 14 percent in London this year.  \u201cSilver is a hybrid,\u201d said  Bart Melek , the head of\ncommodity strategy at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto and the most\naccurate forecaster tracked by Bloomberg Rankings in the past\neight quarters. \u201cIt benefits from being precious. Later on in\nthe year we\u2019re going to see a bit of a recovery in industrial\ndemand.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Nicholas Larkin  in London at \n nlarkin1@bloomberg.net .
