The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUPDATE 6-Oil price dips before U.S. crude inventory data Amanda Cooper \n* U.S. to overtake Russia as top oil producer by 2019 - IEA \n* OPEC compliance, strong demand help stem losses \n* U.S. crude inventories seen up in latest week (Updates prices, adds comment) \nLONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Oil dipped on Tuesday before weekly data that is forecast to show rising U.S. crude inventories, although investor confidence in OPEC's ability to curb output helped stem the price slide. \nBrent crude futures eased 6 cents to $67.44 a barrel by 1519 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 12 cents to $63.79. \nThe American Petroleum Institute releases its weekly figures on U.S. crude inventories later on Tuesday. Stocks are forecast to have risen by 2.7 million barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll. \nInventories have fallen by more than 100 million barrels, or a quarter, in the last 12 months, to their lowest in three years. Seasonally, stocks tend to build in the first three months of the year. \nBut soaring U.S. production is upending global oil markets at a time when other major producers - including the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia - have been withholding output to prop up prices. \nThe United States will overtake Russia as the world's biggest oil producer by 2019, International Energy Agency (IEA) Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Tuesday. \n\"U.S. shale growth is very strong, the pace is very strong ... The United States will become the No.1 oil producer sometime very soon,\" he told Reuters. \nU.S. output was 10.27 million barrels per day (bpd), according to government data released on Thursday, higher than the latest figures for the world's largest exporter Saudi Arabia and just below Russia. \nIn addition to its weekly statistics, the U.S. Energy Information Administration will publish a monthly report on crude supply, which analysts expect to include substantial upward revisions to U.S. oil output. \n\"It is likely that the ... monthly data will show U.S. crude oil production in December about 200,000-300,000 bpd above what was estimated in the weekly reports,\" Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob said in a note. \nA steadier dollar also undermined the crude oil market. A stronger U.S. currency can encourage investors to book profits on their holdings of dollar-priced commodities, stocks or bonds. \n\"Our technical analysts are saying (oil) is bearish unless we break above $67.70,\" SEB head of commodity strategy Bjarne Schieldrop said. \n\"It's been rejected exactly at that level ... and that is where the price action is today. It's at a level where it's a tie between 'back to bullish or back to bearish'.\" \n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein and Osamu Tsukimori Editing by Dale Hudson and Edmund Blair) \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. was 10.0600004196167 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives, Inc. was ",
