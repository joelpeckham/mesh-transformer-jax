 "context": "The following article called 'Treasuries Showing 12% Chance of Double Dip Recession' was published on 2010-07-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. government bond yields are\nsignaling almost no chance of the economy slipping into another\nrecession even as stocks and commodities tumble, according to\nresearch from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.  \n The  2.34 percentage point  gap between yields on two-year\nand 10-year Treasuries is more than double the 20-year average\nand about the same as in 2003, just before gross domestic\nproduct rose 3.6 percent. The so-called yield curve suggests\ngrowth won\u2019t slow to less than 1 percent and about a 12 percent\nchance of a recession in the next year,  Joseph G. Haubrich , head\nof the banking and financial institutions group at the Cleveland\nFed, and  Kent Cherny , a researcher, wrote in a July 1 report.  \n Market rates conflict with growing concerns that the U.S.\neconomy will contract for the second time in three years. Bond\nreturns exceeded stocks by the widest margin in nine years\nduring the first half as investors retreated from higher-\nyielding assets. The Labor Department reported the first drop in\nemployment this year on July 2. At the same time, Wall Street\nexpects bond yields to rise as the U.S. expansion continues.  \n \u201cWe could get a sharper move to higher yields once growth\ndynamics take hold,\u201d  James Caron , head of U.S. interest-rate\nstrategy at Morgan Stanley in New York, said in a July 2\ninterview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe still expect 3.5 percent\ngrowth this year.\u201d  \n The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual rate in the\nfirst quarter, the Commerce Department reported June 25.  \n Falling Yields  \n Morgan Stanley, one of the 18 primary dealers of U.S.\ngovernment securities, predicts 10-year yields will rise to 3.5\npercent by year-end, from 2.98 percent last week. The yield has\ndropped from this year\u2019s high of 4 percent on April 5 amid signs\nthe economy is slowing. The yield was little changed at 2.98\npercent at 9:37 a.m. in New York.  \n While bonds rallied, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index of\nstocks has dropped 8.3 percent this year and the Thomson\nReuters/Jefferies CRB  Index  of 19 raw materials declined 10.2\npercent.  \n The difference between 2- and 10-year yields shrunk to as\nlittle as 2.28 percentage points on July 1, the least since\nOctober, from a record 2.94 percentage points on Feb. 18. That\nwas after the Fed raised its  discount rate  for the first time\nsince 2006.  \n Inverted Curve  \n While an inverted curve is known for predicting recessions,\na steep one is generally a signal of growth, wrote  Joseph G. Haubrich , head of the Cleveland Fed\u2019s banking and financial\ninstitutions group, in the research note. An inverted curve\nreflects expectations for higher interest rates and slowing\ninflation. A steeper curve shows investors demanding increasing\ncompensation for the risk that faster economic growth will spur\ninflation that diminishes the value of bonds\u2019 fixed payments.  \n The curve inverted, with 2-year yields topping 10-year\nyields, before each of the last seven recessions. There were two\n\u201cfalse positives,\u201d where higher short-term rates didn\u2019t\nprecede a recession, Haubrich and Cherny wrote in the report.\nHaubrich and Cherny weren\u2019t available for comment.  \n Projections of the three-month Treasury bill to 10-year\nnote  curve , using past values of the spread and GDP growth,\nsuggest the economy will strengthen by about 1 percent even with\nsome data suggesting a slowdown, they wrote.  \n \u2018Slower Pace\u2019  \n Economists are forecasting the U.S. economy will grow 3.2\npercent this year, and 2.9 percent in 2011, according to the\nmedian forecast of 66 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The\neconomy shrank 2.4 percent in 2009.  \n \u201cThings are still growing but just at a slower pace,\u201d\nsaid  William O\u2019Donnell , U.S. government bond strategist in\nStamford, Connecticut at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,\nanother primary dealer. \u201cIt\u2019s way too premature to say we\u2019re\nheaded to another double dip.\u201d  \n While Morgan Stanley\u2019s forecasts for growth and yields are\namong the high-end of 67 strategists and economists surveyed by\nBloomberg, even firms that say the economy is weakening advise\ninvestors to dump Treasuries because yields are too low relative\nto growth prospects. Citigroup Inc., also a primary dealer,\nissued a report on July 1 that concluded 10-year yields are\nabout 70 basis points below fair value.  \n \u201cConcerns over a double dip now overstated,\u201d  Brett Rose ,\na fixed-income strategist at the New York-based firm, wrote in\nthe report.  \n \u2018Very Slow\u2019  \n Kenneth Rogoff , the Harvard University professor and former\nInternational Monetary Fund chief economist, said economic\nrecoveries under way now \u201care very slow.\u201d At the same time,\n\u201cthe fact that we\u2019re not growing super fast doesn\u2019t necessarily\nsay, well, therefore we\u2019re about to enter something worse,\u201d he\nsaid in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Hong Kong.  \n Sentiment may already be shifting. The yield on the\nbenchmark 3.5 percent note due May 2020 rose three basis points,\nor 0.03 percentage point, on July 2 even after the Labor\nDepartment in Washington said the economy lost 125,000 nonfarm\njobs in June. Investors in a weekly survey by Ried Thunberg\nICAP, a unit of ICAP Plc, the world\u2019s largest inter-dealer\nbroker, became more bearish.  \n The firm\u2019s index on the outlook for Treasuries through\nDecember fell to 40 as of July 2, matching the lowest reading of\nthe year, from 44 a week earlier. A figure less than 50 shows\ninvestors expect prices to fall. The company, based in Jersey\nCity, New Jersey, said it surveyed 26 fund managers overseeing\n$1.38 trillion.  \n Bond Bears  \n Bond bears have been wrong this year. Two-year note yields\ndropped to a  record low  of 0.59 percent on June 30, before\nending last week at 0.62 percent. Ten-year yields fell 13 basis\npoints last week to 2.98 percent.  \n Ten-year note futures due in September gained 13/32 to 122\n23/32 yesterday while U.S. markets were closed for the\nIndependence Day holiday.  \n The curve will end 2010 at 2.33 percentage points as 2-year\nyields jump to 1.37 percent and  10-year yields  rise to 3.70\npercent, according to the median forecasts of 65 economists in a\nBloomberg survey.  \n \u201cThere is no question that folks in the market are worried\nabout a double dip but for the most part their concerns are more\nreflective of things they expect to happen and not so much a\nreaction to data from the past months,\u201d said  Stephen Stanley ,\nchief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford,\nConnecticut, and a former Fed economist.  \n Bonds Returns  \n Bond returns  exceeded  stock gains in the first half by the\nwidest margin since 2001, when the economy was in a recession.\nWhile the MSCI World Index of 24 developed countries fell 9.5\npercent including dividends, bonds gained 4.2 percent, the Bank\nof America Merrill Lynch Global Broad Market Index shows,\nreversing the 5.1 percentage point lead stocks had over debt\nduring the same period in 2009.  \n Indicators of concern about risk in the financial system,\nincluding the cost for banks to borrow from each other and the\ntwo-year interest-rate swap spread, have leveled off after\nrising in April and May, implying relative calm in the markets,\naccording to  Michael Darda , chief economist with MKM Partners\nLLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.  \n The three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor,\nwas 0.531 percent, little changed from May 25, after rising from\n0.29 percent at the end of March, according to the British\nBankers\u2019 Association. Two-year  swap spreads  narrowed to 34.81\nbasis points today from 52.25 basis points on May 24. The\naverage the previous 12 months is 32.25 basis points.  \n Corporate Yields  \n The spread between yields on investment-grade company bonds\nand government debt also stopped widening, ending last week at\n2.08 percentage points, according to Bank of America Merrill\nLynch indexes. That\u2019s about the same as before credit markets\nbegan to seize up in mid-2007 and the economy was growing at a\n3.2 percent pace.  \n The widening gap between 10- and 30-year Treasury yields\nsuggests investors are unconvinced a recession and deflation is\nan immediate risk. The  difference  was 0.96 percentage point July\n2, compared with an average of about 0.43 percentage points\nsince 1990.  \n \u201cYou\u2019re going to be getting respectable levels of growth\nout of the economy,\u201d said  Robert Tipp,  chief investment Repo\nstrategist for fixed income in Newark, New Jersey, at Prudential\nInvestment Management, which oversees more than $200 billion in\nbonds.  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Daniel Kruger  in New York at \n dkruger1@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                           \n                 \n                 \n                                       \n                                   \n               \n                        \n           \n                          July 6 (Bloomberg) -- Niall Ferguson, a professor at Harvard University, talks about so-called bond vigilantes and the U.S.'s debt position and fiscal policy.
