 "context": "The following article called 'Target Raises Profit Forecast as Groceries Boost Sales' was published on 2012-08-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTarget Corp. (TGT)  raised its annual\nprofit forecast as the second-largest U.S. discount retailer\nincreases sales by adding groceries and enticing more spending\nfrom customers with a discount card.  Net income this year will rise to as much as $4.40 a share,\nthe Minneapolis-based chain said today in a statement. That\u2019s up\nfrom a previous projection of a maximum of $4.30 a share in May.\nThe average of analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was\n$4.30.  The retailer plans to boost sales growth by opening stores\nin  Canada  next year, its first expansion outside its home\ncountry. Until then, Target has been working to spur sales by\nadding fresh food sections and offering customers incentives to\nspend with its  credit card , which gives 5 percent off purchases.  \u201cTheir retail business is fine,\u201d  David Strasser , an\nanalyst for Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in  New York , said in an\ninterview. Still, investors should be concerned about Target\u2019s\nnarrowing gross margin and that much of the improvements to its\nresults was generated by the credit-card unit, he said.  Target  rose  1.8 percent to $64.50 at the close in New York.\nThe shares have  gained  26 percent this year.  Net income in the quarter ended July 28 totaled $704\nmillion, or $1.06 a share, compared with $704 million, or $1.03,\na year earlier. Analysts projected $1.01, the average of 22\n estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The results included a one-time tax benefit of 3 cents a\nshare. The company repurchased $549 million in shares, more than\nthe $500 million estimated by  Deborah Weinswig , an analyst at\nCitigroup Inc. Costs related to its entry into Canada reduced\nprofit by 9 cents a share.  Gross Margin  Discounting and selling more food has reduced Target\u2019s\nprofitability because consumers are paying less for items and\ngroceries often have small margins.  Second-quarter retail gross margin, the percentage of sales\nleft after subtracting the cost of goods sold, narrowed to 31.3\npercent from 31.6 percent a year earlier. That marked the eighth\nstraight decline.  The company\u2019s credit card unit became less profitable.\nIncome declined 18 percent to $140 million from $171 million a\nyear earlier. That topped Strasser\u2019s income projection by about\n$40 million.  Sale Talks  The retailer is in talks with several potential buyers of\nits credit-card receivables and hopes to complete a transaction\nby the end of this fiscal year or early in the next one, Chief\nFinancial Officer John Mulligan said today on a conference call\nwith analysts. Target had suspended the sale in January.  The percentage of sales being made through its REDCard\ndiscount program, which includes Target-issued credit and debit\ncards, rose to 13 percent from 8.7 percent a year earlier.  Target previously reported that it increased same-store\nsales 3.1 percent in the second quarter. That followed a gain of\n5.3 percent in the first quarter, its best performance in six\nyears, as the warmest temperatures in  North America  in 50 years\nencouraged shopping.  The retailer also announced that it invested in a company\nalong with other chains, including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , to\nbuild a mobile-payment product as a way to cut costs and send\ndeals to consumers.
