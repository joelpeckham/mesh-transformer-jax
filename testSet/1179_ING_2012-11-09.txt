 "context": "The following article called 'Russia Refrains From Rate Increase After Inflation Eased' was published on 2012-11-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRussia, the largest emerging economy\nto raise  interest rates  this year, refrained from increasing\nborrowing costs after inflation unexpectedly slowed in October\nfor the first time in six months.  Bank Rossii left the refinancing rate at 8.25 percent at a\nmeeting in Moscow, half a percentage point above the record low,\nthe regulator said in a  statement  on its website today. The move\nwas forecast by 21 of 23 economists in a Bloomberg  survey .\nPolicy makers held their main short-term lending and deposit\nrates at 5.5 percent and 4.25 percent.  The decision follows a surprise increase in September that\npolicy makers today credited for tamping down inflation\nexpectations. The central bank also cited a stabilization in\nfood costs that pushed price-growth beyond this year\u2019s target\nrange. The statement\u2019s wording suggests an end to the \u201cmini-\ncycle\u201d of rate increases, according to Vladimir Kolychev, chief\neconomist at Societe Generale SA\u2019s OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  unit in Moscow.  \u201cThe rhetoric looks to be less hawkish as domestic demand\ncontinued to slow down recently, while inflation showed\nencouraging signs of stabilization,\u201d Kolychev said in an e-\nmailed response to questions. While price growth may still reach\n7 percent in December, the weakening core inflation may be a\nmore important sign, he said.  Ruble Slumps  The ruble weakened 0.2 percent to 31.5483 per dollar as of\n12:27 p.m. in Moscow. Forward rate agreements showed the three-\nmonth MosPrime rate may fall 7 basis points, or 0.07 percentage\npoint, in the next three months, up from a 2 point fall before\nthe announcement, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Overnight borrowing costs on  Russia \u2019s interbank market also\nfell, dropping 13 basis points to 5.7150 percent, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. A close at that level would be the\nlowest since Oct. 8.  The currency will probably continue to be driven by\nexternal factors, while short-term interest rates will respond\nto fluctuations in the amount of rubles available to lenders\ndomestically, according to ING Groep NV.  \u201cFor non-resident investors expecting the final\nliberalization of the OFZ market in early 2013, the less hawkish\ncentral bank stance could be viewed as a good sign in terms of\ninterest-rate risk,\u201d Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at ING\nGroep NV in Moscow, said in a note to clients.  Ignatiev\u2019s Tenure  Bank Rossii Chairman Sergey Ignatiev, whose third and final\nterm at the helm of Bank Rossii ends in 2013, needs to rein in\nprice gains next year as the economy slows and his counterparts\nfrom  Poland  to the  Philippines  reduce borrowing costs.  Consumer-price growth slowed to 6.4 percent as of Nov. 6\nfrom a year earlier, Bank Rossii said today. That\u2019s down from\n6.5 percent in October.  Core inflation , which excludes volatile\ncosts such as energy, decelerated for a first time on a monthly\nbasis since May, the Federal Statistics Service said Nov. 6.  \u201cThere was a stabilization of growth rates for all the\nmain consumer inflation components, including food, that were\nthe main source of accelerating inflation in recent months,\u201d\npolicy makers said in the statement. September\u2019s rate increases\nhas led to \u201cmore measured\u201d expectations for inflation, the\nregulator said.  Below 7%  Russia may hold inflation below 7 percent this year,\ncentral bank First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said in the\nState Duma today, Interfax reported. Consumer prices may advance\n0.6 percent in November from the previous month, Deputy Economy\nMinister  Andrei Klepach  said at a press conference in Moscow\ntoday. Prices rose 0.5 percent in October and 0.6 percent in\nSeptember on a monthly basis.  Most Russians named rising prices as their biggest concern,\ntopping corruption, poverty and drug abuse, in an August poll\npublished by the Moscow-based Levada Center. Combatting\ninflation is the government\u2019s top priority, even at the expense\nof short-term growth, President  Vladimir Putin  said at an\ninvestment conference in Moscow on Oct. 2.  Monetary-policy makers said in today\u2019s statement that there\nwere signs of \u201cstabilizing\u201d lending, while economic indicators\nfor September maintained the earlier trend that suggested a\n\u201ccooling\u201d of growth.  \u201cAt the same time, the threat of a substantial economic\nslowdown linked to monetary tightening is seen as\ninsignificant,\u201d the central bank said.  Russia\u2019s M2, the broadest measure of  money supply , grew\n14.8 percent in September, the slowest since November 2009,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  2013 Goal  Policy makers want to hold inflation at 5 percent to 6\npercent next year, half a percentage point higher than\npreviously targeted, after conceding consumer-price growth\nbreached that range in 2012.  \u201cAs in the previous months, the central bank did not\ninclude the paragraph on the short- and medium-term adequacy of\nthe interest rates,\u201d  Yaroslav Lissovolik , head of research at\nDeutsche Bank AG in Moscow, said in an e-mail.  \u201cThe central bank is aiming to secure some room for\nmaneuver going into the end of this year, though clearly\ncompared to earlier statements the tone of the central bank is\nmore dovish,\u201d he said.
