 "context": "The following article called 'Nokia Record Cash Targets Alcatel Wireless Unit: Real M&A' was published on 2013-10-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNokia Oyj (NOK1V) \u2019s sale of its handset\nbusiness is clearing the way for a 2 billion euro ($2.7 billion)\ntakeover of  Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU) \u2019s wireless network-equipment unit.  With Nokia receiving 5.44 billion euros next year for\nselling its handset unit to Microsoft Corp., the company\u2019s cash\nis set to exceed 14 billion euros, its highest balance on record\nand the eighth-most among non-finance companies in Europe,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time,\nAlcatel-Lucent Chief Executive Officer Michel Combes is\naccelerating plans to scale down, including selling assets, to\nhelp the  unprofitable  French company survive.  \u201cThis deal makes complete sense,\u201d Sami Sarkamies, a\nHelsinki-based analyst at Nordea Bank AB, said in a phone\ninterview. \u201cNokia will have the financial flexibility to do\nthis kind of deal and Alcatel needs to slim down. There is a\nrelatively high likelihood of this deal happening.\u201d  Nokia has evaluated options including a combination with\nAlcatel-Lucent\u2019s mobile-phone networks business, a person with\nknowledge of the matter said last month. An acquisition would\nopen the U.S. market to Nokia, helping the Finnish company\nshrink the gap with market leader  Ericsson AB. (ERICB)  With analysts\u2019\nestimates for the cost of the wireless business ranging from 1\nbillion to 2 billion euros, Pohjola Bank said Nokia will also be\nable to resume paying a  dividend  of as much as 40 cents a share.  Microsoft Deal  Doug Dawson, a spokesman for Espoo, Finland-based Nokia,\nand Simon Poulter, a spokesman for Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent,\ndeclined to comment on the prospects for consolidation.  \u201cAlcatel-Lucent\u2019s focus is on executing the Shift Plan as\nthe means of managing our own destiny,\u201d Poulter said, citing\nthe company\u2019s turnaround plan.  Nokia\u2019s sale of the mobile-phone business to Microsoft was\nannounced Sept. 3 and is expected to be completed in the first\nquarter, handing the company cash of 3.79 billion euros for the\nphone division plus 1.65 billion euros for patents.  A month earlier, Nokia took full control from Siemens AG of\nthe Nokia Solutions and Networks business, which generates 13\nbillion euros a year and will account for more than 90 percent\nof sales after Nokia exits handset making. Buying Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s wireless segment would add another 3.4 billion euros in\n annual sales , excluding services and software.  The new entity would command 32 percent of the world\u2019s\nwireless infrastructure market, based on data from Barclays Plc,\novertaking Chinese competitor Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s 22\npercent share and nearing market leader Ericsson\u2019s 36 percent.  \u2018Huge Opportunity\u2019  Nokia, Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent are vying for contracts\nfrom wireless operators as they upgrade networks using fourth-generation technology to cope with data-hungry tablets and\nsmartphones. The U.S. presents an opening as Shenzhen-based\nHuawei has been barred there on security concerns.  \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity,\u201d  Janardan Menon , a London-based\nanalyst at Liberum Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview.\n\u201cThe U.S. is the largest market in the world and Nokia doesn\u2019t\nhave any share there outside of T-Mobile. An acquisition of\nAlcatel-Lucent\u2019s wireless business will give Nokia a much-needed\n footprint .\u201d  U.S. phone companies  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , AT&T Inc.\nand Sprint Communications Inc. together accounted for 35 percent\nof Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s revenue last year, while making up less than\n4 percent of Nokia\u2019s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Turnaround Plan  Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s Combes, who took over as CEO in April, is\ntrying to staunch a drain on cash as the first step toward\nrenegotiating debt to get back the company\u2019s patents that were\npreviously pledged as loan collateral. To do that, Combes is\nspeeding up a turnaround effort, including a tighter focus on\nmore lucrative businesses.  \u201cWe are going to focus on the areas where we can be one of\nthe top three players in the world,\u201d Combes said this week\nduring a hearing at the French National Assembly. \u201cOtherwise,\nit\u2019s not worth it.\u201d  Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s wireless assets may sell for 1 billion to\n2 billion euros, according to the range of estimates from\nanalysts at Nordea, Credit Suisse AG, Barclays and Kepler\nCheuvreux  France .  No talks were under way between Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia as\nof Sept. 26, Bloomberg News reported at the time, citing people\nwith knowledge of the matter.  Junk Rating  Alcatel-Lucent fell 2 percent to close at 2.66 euros in\nParis. Nokia added 0.3 percent to 5.29 euros in Helsinki.  Nokia had 9.1 billion euros of  cash  and equivalents as of\nJune 30. Adding the 5.44 billion euros in expected proceeds from\nthe sale to Microsoft would potentially push the company\u2019s cash\npile to 14.5 billion euros. Nokia, which has a  junk  credit\nrating, has 5.4 billion euros of total debt.  On a Sept. 3 conference call, Timo Ihamuotila, Nokia\u2019s\nchief financial officer and interim president, said that if the\nMicrosoft and Siemens transactions had closed before the end of\nthe second quarter, the company would have had gross cash of\n14.9 billion euros.  Nokia, which skipped a  dividend  payment this year for the\nfirst time in at least 143 years, will evaluate its three\nremaining units and then return excess cash to shareholders, he\nsaid.  \u201cNokia will certainly have the firepower to do both M&A\nand resume its dividend,\u201d Hannu Rauhala, an analyst at Pohjola\nBank in Helsinki, said in a phone interview. \u201cIf Nokia pays\naround 2 billion euros for the Alcatel wireless assets and keeps\na healthy balance sheet to keep carriers\u2019 confidence, they would\nstill have enough cash to pay a dividend of up to 40 cents. The\ndeal would be a smart move for Nokia and its investors.\u201d  Deal Setbacks  A purchase of Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s wireless assets would entail\nat least 500 million euros of restructuring expenses, according\nto analysts\u2019 estimates at Nordea, Credit Suisse and Barclays.  The companies already have a track record of difficult\ndeals. Nokia\u2019s networks business was formed through a 2007 joint\nventure with Siemens, and led to 9,000 job cuts in the first\nyear alone. The 2006 combination of Alcatel SA and Lucent\nTechnologies resulted in more than $10 billion in cumulated\nlosses and a reduction of about a third of the workforce.  France, which  owns  3.6 percent of Alcatel-Lucent, has\nalready shown it is willing to intervene in the company\u2019s\nstrategy. President Francois Hollande\u2019s Socialist government\nlast week threatened to block Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s plans for firings\nand in February considered buying a bigger stake in the company\nto protect its patents.  Samsung, Ericsson  Nokia may be pressed to act before Ericsson or  Samsung\nElectronics Co. (005930)  considers bidding, said Sarkamies of Nordea.\nWhile Barclays said in an Oct. 14 note that Ericsson may face\nregulatory hurdles in the U.S., Sarkamies said Samsung may view\nAlcatel-Lucent\u2019s assets as a chance to become a player in\nwireless network equipment after overtaking Apple Inc. as the\nworld\u2019s largest smartphone vendor.  Samsung is not considering an acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent\u2019s assets, a representative for the South Korean company\nsaid in an e-mailed statement. Ericsson\u2019s focus continues to be\non organic growth, Ola Rembe, a spokesman for the Stockholm-based company, said by e-mail.  \u201cAlcatel-Lucent\u2019s wireless business would be a good fit\nfor Nokia and a deal definitely makes sense on paper, though\nexecution would likely be tricky,\u201d Sebastien Sztabowicz, a\nParis-based analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said by phone.
