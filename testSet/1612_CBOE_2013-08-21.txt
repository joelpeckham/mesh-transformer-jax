 "context": "The following article called 'Goldman\u2019s Options Error Shows Peril Persists After Knight' was published on 2013-08-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFor all the efforts to shore up\nelectronic markets in the aftermath of one of America\u2019s biggest\ntrading catastrophes, yesterday\u2019s options malfunction by  Goldman\nSachs (GS)  Group Inc. shows the dangers haven\u2019t gone away.  A programming error caused the firm to send unintentional\nstock options orders in the first minutes of trading, pushing\nprices on dozens of contracts to a dollar each, according to a\nperson briefed on the matter yesterday and data compiled by\nBloomberg. Any losses for Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest U.S.\nbank by assets, won\u2019t be known until exchanges determine which\ncontracts should be canceled, said the person, who requested\nanonymity because the information is private.  Investors who fret about the increasing dominance of\nelectronic exchanges say the error at Goldman Sachs, which\ngenerated about half its revenue from trading last quarter,\nshows that worse breakdowns are inevitable. A year ago, Knight\nCapital Group Inc. was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy by a\ntrading breakdown, and Chinese regulators are investigating\nbroker  Everbright (601788)  Securities Co. after $3.8 billion of incorrect\nbuy orders sent the Shanghai Composite Index up about 6 percent\nin two minutes last week.  \u201cIt can happen to anybody, no firm is immune,\u201d Matt McCormick, who helps oversee $9.6 billion as a money manager at\nCincinnati-based Bahl & Gaynor Inc., said in a phone interview.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s Goldman Sachs, the error could be pretty large.\u201d  Sorting Trades  Exchanges were working to sort out the trades and any loss\n\u201cwould not be material to the financial condition of the\nfirm,\u201d according to an e-mail from David Wells, a spokesman for\nNew York-based Goldman Sachs. The company\u2019s shares slipped 0.6\npercent to $158.68 at 9:51 a.m.  New York  time.  An internal system that Goldman Sachs uses to help prepare\nto meet market demand for equity options inadvertently produced\norders with inaccurate price limits and sent them to exchanges\nyesterday, according to the person familiar with the situation.\nSome of the transactions have already been voided, data compiled\nby Bloomberg show.  A \u201clarge number\u201d of trades from the session\u2019s first 17\nminutes for tickers beginning with the letters H through L are\nbeing examined and most of the transactions may be canceled,\naccording to a statement yesterday from  NYSE Euronext (NYX) \u2019s U.S.\noptions business. NYSE and  Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc. said today that\nthey have completed the trade reviews, according to e-mailed\nstatements from the exchanges.  Options Trades  Representatives for other U.S. options market operators --\nNasdaq\u2019s Robert Madden,  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) \u2019s Gail Osten,\nInternational Securities Exchange LLC\u2019s Molly McGregor and Bats\nGlobal Markets Inc.\u2019s Suzanne O\u2019Halloran -- all declined to\ncomment.  \u201cAs is our practice, we have been monitoring developments\nand talking with the exchanges and other market participants as\nappropriate,\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman  John Nester  said in an e-mail.  Of the 500 biggest options trades in the first 15 minutes\nmarkets were open yesterday, 405 of them were for tickers\nstarting with H through L and priced at $1, according to data\ncompiled by Trade Alert LLC and Bloomberg. Almost 130 of those\nwere in 1,000-contract lots.  Busting Trades  \u201cTo bust a trade in equities it\u2019s relatively\nstraightforward, to bust a trade in options it would take more\ntime,\u201d Howard Tai, a Kansas City, Missouri-based analyst with\nAite Group LLC, said in an interview. \u201cYou need to look at each\none of the factors and then run through a sanity check, and say,\n\u2018Beyond the cash equity price at the time it happened, how did\neverything else affect it?\u2019\u201d  Investors in  China  were whipsawed by a computer malfunction\nlast week. State-controlled brokerage Everbright reported a\ntrading loss of 194 million  yuan  ($32 million) and apologized to\ninvestors after errors in order-execution systems on Aug. 16\nsparked the biggest intraday swing in China\u2019s benchmark index\nsince 2009. The incident touched off a 53 percent surge in\nvolume in the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which jumped from a loss\nof as much as 1 percent to a gain of 5.6 percent in two minutes.  Everbright\u2019s stock plunged by the 10 percent daily limit\nyesterday after the China Securities Regulatory Commission\nbanned the brokerage from proprietary trading for three months\nand started investigating what it described as the first\nincident of its kind in China. The company said today that it\n suspended  its head of proprietary trading.  Goldman, Knight  At Knight, computers spewed orders onto exchanges on Aug.\n1, 2012, that created a more than $450 million loss for the\nbrokerage. The mishap forced the company to near-insolvency\nbefore it was acquired by Getco LLC and spurred calls to examine\nwhether increasing automation is damaging markets.  Knight had a $1 billion market value on July 31, 2012, the\nday before the trading error, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. Its stock fell 33 percent the next day. Goldman\nSachs, which saw its stock rise 0.6 percent yesterday, has a\nmarket capitalization of $75 billion.  Goldman Sachs reported net income of $1.93 billion in the\nsecond quarter on a surge in underwriting revenue and gains from\nthe firm\u2019s own investments. In the quarter before its trading\nmishap, Knight posted net income of $3.3 million.  Written Policies  The SEC proposed rules in March requiring U.S. exchanges\nand some brokers to conduct coordinated trading tests to show\nthey can recover from disruptions. The mandate, called\nRegulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, directs exchanges\nto strengthen their technology and instruct member firms to\nparticipate in tests to show they can sustain operations after\ninterruptions.  The proposed rule requires firms to have written policies\nand procedures to ensure that systems supporting trading,\nclearing, order-routing and surveillance have sufficient\ncapacity and remain available to their users. The technology\nmust operate as intended, be secure from threats and promote\nfair and orderly markets. A review must be done at least once a\nyear by objective personnel, the SEC said.  The changes by trading firms, exchanges and regulators are\nmaking the industry better at navigating technology mishaps and\nhuman errors, said Ben Schwartz of Lightspeed Financial Inc.  The securities industry has \u201clearned from the mistakes\nwe\u2019ve made in the past and tried to grow a technology to\nsimplify a process and grow more consistent,\u201d Schwartz, the\nChicago-based chief market strategist at broker Lightspeed\nFinancial, said in a phone interview yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s a\npositive thing that they react immediately in a timely manner.\u201d  Canceled Trades  Among yesterday\u2019s canceled trades, 241 September $103 puts\non the iShares Russell 2000 Exchange-Traded Fund traded at $1 at\n9:32 a.m. New York time, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. That price was down from $3.32 two minutes earlier.\nAt the same time, 1,000 October $90 calls on Johnson & Johnson\ntraded at $1, followed less than 11 minutes later by two\ncontracts at $2.10.  \u201cWe\u2019re all working too fast, too thin and we\u2019ve got\nsystems that do things for you,\u201d said Tim Hartzell, who helps\nmanage about $425 million as chief investment officer at Sequent\nAsset Management in Houston. \u201cYou can make so many little\nerrors.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nNikolaj Gammeltoft in New York at \n ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net ;\nAlex Barinka in New York at \n abarinka2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nLynn Thomasson at \n lthomasson@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CBOE Holdings, Inc. was 44.38440704345703 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CBOE Holdings, Inc. was ",
