(GOOG) \u2019s Motorola Mobility unit\nsaid it was withdrawing a patent-infringement complaint it filed\nin August against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  at the U.S. International Trade\nCommission.  Motorola Mobility reserved the right to refile claims\nagainst the iPhone maker, and said there had been no agreement\nbetween the two companies, according to filing on the ITC\u2019s\nelectronic docket. It gave no reason for withdrawing the\ncomplaint.  A notice of dismissal also was filed in a companion civil\nlawsuit filed in a federal court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Apple, based in Cupertino,  California , and Motorola\nMobility, based in Libertyville,  Illinois , have been fighting\nabout smartphone-related patents since at least 2010 after\nlicensing talks failed. A non-jury trial on Apple\u2019s claims that\nMotorola Mobility violated obligations to license some of its\npatents on fair terms is scheduled to begin Nov. 5 in a federal\ncourt in Madison,  Wisconsin .  Neither  Kristin Huguet , a spokeswoman for Apple, nor\nChrista Smith, a spokeswoman for Motorola Mobility, had an\nimmediate comment on withdrawal of the ITC complaint. Dockets in\nother cases pending between the companies don\u2019t show other\nrequests for dismissal.  Smartphone Features  The case being withdrawn accused Apple of infringing seven\nMotorola Mobility patents on features including interactive\nvoice commands, location reminders, e-mail notification and\nphone/video players. Motorola Mobility, which Google bought in\nMay, said in August it hoped the filing of the suit -- and the\nthreat against Apple\u2019s iPhone -- would push the two sides into\nsettlement talks.  Another case is pending at the Washington trade agency,\nwhich has the power to block imports of products that infringe\nU.S. patents. The commission on Aug. 24 cleared Apple of\ninfringing three Motorola Mobility patents, and told the judge\nto consider whether a fourth patent, for a sensor to protect\nagainst accidental hangups, was infringed.  ITC Judge Thomas Pender, in an order dated yesterday, said\nhe will make a decision by Dec. 21 on that issue.  The case to be withdrawn is In the Matter of Wireless\nCommunication Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing\ndevices, Computers, and Components Thereof, 337-856, and the\nearlier case is In the Matter of Certain Wireless Communication\nDevices, Portable Music Data, Processing Data Devices, Computers\nand Components Thereof, 337-745. Both are in the U.S.\nInternational Trade Commission ( Washington ).
