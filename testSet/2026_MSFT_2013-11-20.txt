 "context": "The following article called 'Business Groups Pan Baucus Tax Changes as Uncompetitive' was published on 2013-11-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBusiness groups lined up to\ncriticize Senate Finance Chairman  Max Baucus \u2019s international tax\nproposal within hours of its release, slowing the momentum he\nsought to build for the plan.  Baucus released a draft bill yesterday that would lower the\ncorporate tax rate by an unspecified amount, end a rule that has\nencouraged companies to accumulate about $2 trillion in earnings\nin their foreign subsidiaries and impose a 20 percent tax on\nthose stockpiled profits.  The Finance panel chairman, who has been criticized by\nfellow Democrats for being too friendly to business, is\nencountering opposition from some of the multinational\ncorporations he has courted. Coalitions backed by companies\nincluding  General Electric Co. (GE) ,  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  and\n Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  said the plan would hurt U.S. companies\u2019\nability to compete in overseas markets.  \u201cThey increase complexity and move our antiquated tax\nsystem even further from international norms,\u201d  Bruce Josten ,\nthe top lobbyist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said of\nBaucus\u2019s ideas in a statement.  The chamber, the country\u2019s largest business lobbying group,\nwas joined yesterday by the  Business Roundtable , the National\nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Alliance for Competitive\nTaxation, the Let\u2019s Invest for Tomorrow America Coalition and\nthe  National Foreign Trade Council , which each issued statements\ncriticizing the tax proposal.  The trade council, whose board of directors includes\n Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , said it was\n\u201cdisappointed\u201d in Baucus\u2019s plan.  \u2018Penalize Multinationals\u2019  \u201cThis draft appears to penalize multinationals and will\nmake it more difficult for companies to compete globally,\u201d\nCatherine Schultz, the group\u2019s vice president for  tax policy ,\nsaid in a statement.  Baucus, of Montana, who plans to release drafts on other\ntax topics today and tomorrow, wants to make the biggest tax\ncode changes since 1986 before he leaves Congress at the end of\n2014. He and his House Republican counterpart,  Dave Camp  of\nMichigan, have been stymied by the partisan divide over whether\nthe government should collect more revenue.  \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make something happen by taking the\ninitiative,\u201d Baucus said yesterday. \u201cTax reform has more\npolitical potency than a lot of people at first believe.\u201d  Technically Complex  The international tax system is one of the most technically\ncomplex areas of the U.S. tax code and potential changes are\nbeing watched closely by companies that have significant global\nbusinesses, including Pfizer Inc., Apple Inc. and The  Procter &\nGamble Co. (PG)   For more than two years, many companies have been lobbying\nCongress for a system that would lessen the tax burden on U.S.\ncompanies\u2019 overseas income. They make the argument that most\nother industrialized countries don\u2019t require their companies to\npay home-country taxes on foreign income.  Baucus\u2019s plan would make it harder for companies to shift\nprofits from the U.S. and require a type of minimum tax that\nwould limit the benefit of earning income in low-tax countries.  Some of the criticism stems from the plan\u2019s vagueness on\nthe corporate tax rate. Unlike Camp\u2019s proposal, which favors a\n25 percent rate without specifying how he would offset the\nbudgetary cost, Baucus has said only that he hopes to get the\nrate below 30 percent, down from 35 percent now. Corporations\nwould find the changes more palatable with a lower rate.  Groups aligned with labor unions, such as Americans for Tax\nFairness and Citizens for Tax Justice, said yesterday that\nBaucus\u2019s plan doesn\u2019t go far enough because he\u2019s insisting that\ncorporate tax changes should be revenue-neutral instead of\nraising the taxes companies pay.  Lew\u2019s Support  Baucus garnered supportive or neutral statements from\nTreasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and at least four members of his\ncommittee -- Democrats  Ron Wyden  of Oregon,  Sherrod Brown  of\nOhio and  Jay Rockefeller  of West Virginia, along with Republican\nRob Portman of Ohio.  Baucus\u2019s plan would make it tougher for companies to claim\nthat profits are earned in low-tax countries, said Ed Kleinbard,\na tax-law professor at the University of  Southern California .  Under the Baucus plan, technology and pharmaceutical\ncompanies would no longer be able to pay single-digit effective\ntax rates on their foreign income, he said.  \u2018Income Strategies\u2019  \u201cThe package reduces the opportunities for large-scale\nstateless income strategies both by U.S. multinationals and by\nforeign multinationals doing business in the United States,\u201d\nsaid Kleinbard, a former chief of staff of the congressional\nJoint Committee on Taxation.  Under current law, U.S. companies owe taxes at the federal\nrate of 35 percent on all income they earn around the world.\nThey receive tax credits for payments to foreign governments and\ncan defer U.S. taxation until they repatriate the money.  That system has encouraged companies to accumulate untaxed\nearnings in foreign subsidiaries. It also creates incentives for\ncompanies to move intellectual property out of the U.S. and into\nlow-tax jurisdictions.  Many other countries, including the U.K. and Japan, have\nshifted to what\u2019s known as a territorial system in which\ncompanies owe little or no taxes on their foreign income. In the\nopposite direction, industrialized countries have been moving to\nprevent companies from using accounting maneuvers to shift\nincome outside their borders.  The Baucus plan is \u201ca cautious, modest step in the\ndirection of territorial taxation,\u201d said Alan Viard, a resident\nscholar at the  American Enterprise Institute , a research group\nin Washington that advocates for small government.  Hybrid System  Baucus, in suggesting a hybrid between current law and a\nterritorial system, is proposing two options for his minimum\ntax. The first would tax all income from foreign sales and\nservices immediately at a rate equal to 80 percent of the new\nU.S. rate.  Baucus has said he wants a new tax rate of less than 30\npercent. If it were set at 28 percent, for example, the minimum\ntax would be set at 22.4 percent.  That rate would apply to a company\u2019s earnings in each\njurisdiction, so that companies operating in high-tax areas\nwould owe no incremental U.S. tax on their foreign earnings. A\ncompany operating in Ireland, by contrast, would effectively\nhave to pay the U.S. the difference between the Irish tax rate\nof 12.5 percent and 22.4 percent.  The second option would set a lower minimum tax rate, 60\npercent of the U.S. rate, while narrowing the definition of\nincome eligible to only income from active business operations.\nOther income would be taxed at the full U.S. rate immediately.  Accumulated Earnings  The earnings that companies have accumulated under the\ncurrent system would be taxed at 20 percent over eight years,\nregardless of whether companies have the money in liquid form\nand regardless of whether they bring it back to the U.S.  That tax would generate more than $200 billion, and Baucus\nhasn\u2019t decided what to do with the revenue. Some could be used\nto ease the transition to the new system. Some could be used, as\nPresident  Barack Obama  has suggested, for infrastructure.  Baucus is seeking comments from companies and senators by\nJan. 17.  Senator  Orrin Hatch  of Utah, the top Republican on the\nFinance Committee, said he disagreed with Baucus\u2019s decision to\nrelease the drafts while Democrats are proposing tax increases\nin a budget conference committee.  Today\u2019s draft is expected to address tax administration\nissues, including tax filing and  identity theft . Tomorrow\u2019s\nproposal is expected to focus on capital-cost recovery and\ndepreciation rules.
