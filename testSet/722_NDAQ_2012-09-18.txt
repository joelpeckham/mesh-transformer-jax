The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNeas Energy A/S , a Danish power-\ntrading company, plans to buy and sell U.K. electricity on the\n N2EX  exchange this year and targets an expansion into other\nEuropean energy markets by 2015.  \u201cWe\u2019re especially interested in U.K. power, and hope to\nstart trading on the N2EX exchange by the end of the year,\u201d\nRasmus Buhl Moeller, a company spokesman, said yesterday by\nphone from Aalborg,  Denmark . U.K. trading is increasing and has\na growing share of  wind energy , he said, without providing\ndetails.  Neas is seeking growth in markets outside Denmark as the\nEuropean Commission implements political targets for boosting\nrenewable energy and cross-border trading. The regulator of the\n27-nation bloc aims to create a single regional power and gas\nmarket by 2014.  The Danish company, which trades electricity across borders\nin 14 countries and power in  Germany  and the Nordic markets,\nplans to move into eastern European natural-gas trading and the\nGerman wind and solar power markets, as well as the French\n electricity market , Buhl Moeller said. Neas is also targeting\nthe Dutch and Belgian markets, he said.  Neas owns NE Capital Management A/S, which offers  managed\naccounts  for power derivatives,  carbon emissions  and related\ncoal and natural gas contracts, according to its website. The\nstrategy lost 0.7 percent in August and has gained 5.1 percent\nso far this year after increasing 4.1 percent in 2011, according\nto a monthly report sent to investors.  \u201cDespite financial turmoil, we experience growing interest\nfrom investors who seek to diversify risks by seeking exposure\nto EU power markets, a niche instrument with low correlation to\nstocks and bonds,\u201d Buhl Moeller said.  N2EX is an UK power exchange, operated by  Nasdaq OMX Group\nInc. (NDAQ)  and Nord Pool Spot AS.
