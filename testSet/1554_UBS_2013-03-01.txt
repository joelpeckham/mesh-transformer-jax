 "context": "The following article called 'Oil Falls to 2013 Low on China, Europe Manufacturing' was published on 2013-03-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWest Texas Intermediate oil slipped\nto the lowest level this year as manufacturing expanded less\nthan forecast in  China  and contracted in  Europe , bolstering\nconcern that fuel demand will decline.  Futures fell 1.5 percent after data showed China\u2019s\nmanufacturing growth slowed for a second month while factory\noutput declined in the euro area and the U.K. The factory data\nhelped the  U.S. dollar  strengthen against the British pound and\nthe euro. A stronger dollar curbs the appeal of raw materials to\ninvestors.  \u201cOil is down because of the disappointing manufacturing\nindex data overnight, especially the Chinese number, which shows\nthe country had the smallest of expansions,\u201d said  John Kilduff ,\na partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that\nfocuses on energy. \u201cU.K. manufacturing has plunged into\ncontraction, which is going to hurt demand.\u201d  Crude oil for April delivery fell $1.37 to $90.68 a barrel\non the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since\nDec. 24. Prices dropped 2.6 percent this week. The volume of all\nfutures traded was down 1.5 percent from the 100-day average at\n3:10 p.m.  Brent oil for April settlement dropped 98 cents, or 0.9\npercent, to end the session at $110.40 a barrel on the London-\nbased ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest close since\nJan. 15. Volume was 52 percent above the 100-day average. The\nEuropean benchmark grade traded at a premium of $19.72 to WTI,\nup from $19.33 yesterday.  Chinese Manufacturing  In China, the world\u2019s biggest oil-consuming country after\nthe U.S., manufacturing slowed last month, the PMI report from\nthe Federation of Logistics and Purchasing in Beijing showed.\nThe reading fell to 50.1 last month from 50.4 in January.  A gauge of  U.K. manufacturing  based on a survey of\n purchasing managers  slid to 47.9 last month, according to Markit\nEconomics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply .\nIn the euro region, a  factory gauge  was unchanged in February at\n47.9, marking a 19th month of contraction, according to a\nseparate Markit report today.  Futures rebounded from the day\u2019s lows as U.S.  consumer\nconfidence  increased and a report showed that manufacturing grew\nat the fastest pace since June 2011. The  Institute for Supply\nManagement  said its factory index rose to 54.2, the highest\nreading since June 2011.  Dollar Rally  The economic data helped the dollar climb to the highest\nlevel against the euro in almost three months after Italian\nelections this week delivered a four-way parliamentary split.\nThe U.S. currency also rose above $1.50 against the pound for\nthe first time since July 2010.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of flight into the dollar since the\nItalian election,\u201d Kilduff said. \u201cThe pound broke through\n$1.50 today, which is a very important level.\u201d  The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell as\nmuch as 1.3 percent to 640.03, the lowest level since Dec. 31.  Oil also slipped as a Bloomberg survey of analysts showed\noutput by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries climbed. Libyan daily production increased by 130,000\nbarrels to 1.24 million last month, the biggest gain of any\nmember, after the reopening of the country\u2019s Zueitina export\nterminal early in February.  Saudi Production  Saudi Arabia , OPEC\u2019s biggest producer, pumped 9 million\nbarrels a day, the least since May 2011, according to the\nsurvey. Output was down 100,000 barrels from January and 900,000\nbarrels from May, when production reached the highest since at\nleast January 1989.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing oil be more conservatively priced, but we\nstill aren\u2019t at fair value,\u201d said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst\nat Citi Futures Perspective in New York. \u201cThe fundamentals\nsupport a price in the $80-to-$85 area.\u201d  U.S. crude inventories increased 1.13 million barrels to\n377.5 million last week, the highest level since July, a Feb. 27\nEnergy Information Administration report showed. Output climbed\nto 7.12 million barrels a day in the week ended Feb. 15, the\nmost since August 1992.  \u201cThe fundamentals didn\u2019t justify the high level of  oil\nprices ,\u201d said Julius Walker, global energy markets strategist\nat UBS Securities LLC in New York. \u201cThe fundamentals are\nreasserting themselves.\u201d  Net-long positions in West Texas Intermediate oil held by\nmoney managers, or wagers on rising prices, climbed to 221,534\nin the week ended Feb. 15, the highest level since March 2012,\naccording to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u2019s\nCommitments of Traders report.  \u201cOne has to remember that there was an awful lot of length\nin the market,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing massive reversal\nnow, which is putting pressure on futures.\u201d  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 463,360\ncontracts as of 3:11 p.m. It totaled 455,826 contracts\nyesterday, 14 percent below the three-month average. Open\ninterest was 1.66 million contracts.
