 "context": "The following article called 'Bernanke Says Fed May Delay QE Taper If Economy Misses Forecasts' was published on 2013-07-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFederal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  opened the door to a delay in reducing the central\nbank\u2019s bond buying program, saying it will depend on data that\neconomists say are falling short of the Fed\u2019s own forecasts.  The Fed\u2019s $85 billion in monthly asset purchases \u201care by\nno means on a preset course,\u201d Bernanke said yesterday in his\nsemiannual testimony to Congress. He added that the  Federal Open\nMarket Committee  will \u201cbe responding to the data.\u201d  Bernanke\u2019s comments, which also emphasized the risks to the\neconomy from  federal budget  cuts and slowing growth overseas,\npushed Treasuries and U.S. stocks higher as investors reduced\nbets the Fed would start to trim bond purchases in September.\nHis testimony is set to continue at 10:30 a.m. today before the\nSenate Banking Committee.  \u201cBernanke doesn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to taper,\u201d said\n Joseph LaVorgna , chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank\nSecurities Inc. in  New York , who formerly worked for the New\nYork Fed. \u201cThe probabilities of a September taper have come\ndown.\u201d  The Treasury 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04\npercentage point, to 2.49 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York,\naccording to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched 2.46\npercent, the lowest since July 3. The  Standard & Poor\u2019s  500\nindex rose 0.3 percent to 1,675.60, extending its gain for the\nyear to 17.9 percent.  Bernanke said last month that the Fed may start to trim\nbond purchases later this year and end the program around the\nmiddle of 2014 if the economy meets its forecasts for growth of\n2.3 percent to 2.6 percent for 2013, with unemployment projected\nto fall to 7.2 percent to 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter.  Growth Outlook  Michael Feroli , chief U.S. economist for JPMorgan Chase &\nCo., said that given his estimate for a 1 percent pace of\nexpansion in the second quarter, growth would have to exceed a 3\npercent rate in the second half to meet the Fed\u2019s growth\nestimate for the year.  \u201cThe trajectory of the third quarter isn\u2019t phenomenal,\u201d\nFeroli said. \u201cWhat I take from Bernanke\u2019s remarks is the\nmessage that they aren\u2019t totally confident. The odds of a\nSeptember taper got nudged down a little.\u201d  Recent reports on trade, inventories and  consumer spending \nhave prompted economists to mark down their estimates for\nsecond-quarter growth.  The trade deficit unexpectedly jumped in May as imports\nclimbed to the second-highest level on record while exports\nstagnated. Inventories increased at a slower pace in May, and\nretail sales excluding autos were little changed in June.  New Forecasts  St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, which updates\nits estimate of GDP with each new piece of data, now forecasts\nthe economy grew at an 0.7 percent annual rate in the second\nquarter, down from a 1.7 percent estimate at the start of July.\nThe world\u2019s largest economy expanded at a 1.8 percent pace in\nthe first quarter.  The economy will expand at a\u00a02.3 percent pace in the third\nquarter and 2.6 percent in the final three months of the year,\naccording to the median of 68 responses in a Bloomberg survey of\neconomists conducted July 5 to July 10.  Any further slowing in the economy would probably cause the\nFed to reassess how fast asset purchases should be trimmed, said\nTim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon in Eugene who\nformerly worked at the  U.S. Treasury .  Bernanke \u201cpushed back against the idea that the path of\nscaling back quantitative easing is calendar dependent,\u201d Duy\nsaid.  \u2018Well Above\u2019  In his testimony, the 59-year-old Fed chairman said the 7.6\n unemployment rate  in June is \u201cwell above\u201d normal levels while\nlabor market conditions remain \u201cfar from satisfactory.\u201d  \u201cIf the data are stronger than we expect, we\u2019ll move more\nquickly\u201d to  reduce purchases , he told lawmakers. If data\n\u201cdon\u2019t meet the kinds of expectations we have about where the\neconomy\u2019s going, then we would delay that process or potentially\nincrease purchases for a time.\u201d  Bernanke also said the Fed could keep buying bonds for\nlonger if \u201cfinancial conditions -- which have tightened\nrecently -- were judged to be insufficiently accommodative to\nallow us to attain our mandated objectives.\u201d  The 10-year Treasury yield rose as high as 2.74 percent\nthis month from 1.93 percent on May 21, the day before Bernanke\nsaid the FOMC may trim its bond buying in its \u201cnext few\nmeetings\u201d if officials see signs of sustained improvement in\nthe labor market.  Inflation Forecast  The FOMC said in a June 19 statement that keeping the\nfederal funds rate between zero and 0.25 percent \u201cwill be\nappropriate at least as long\u201d as unemployment remains above 6.5\npercent and the forecast for inflation in one to two years\ndoesn\u2019t exceed 2.5 percent.  Bernanke\u2019s comments in June on tapering, and an employment\nreport showing non-farm payrolls rose by 195,000 in both May and\nJune, prompted economists such as  Laurence Meyer , a co-founder\nof Macroeconomic Advisers, to focus on September as the probable\ndate of a reduction in asset purchases.  Those perceptions were reinforced by June 28 comments by\nFed Governor  Jeremy Stein , who indicated September could be an\nappropriate time for the committee to make a decision.  Bret Barker, managing director and portfolio manager at Los\nAngeles-based TCW Group Inc., which manages $128 billion, said\npolicy makers still have good reason to start tapering in\nSeptember.  Minutes from Fed meetings show that several of the 19 FOMC\nmembers have been cautious about the costs and benefits of the\nthird round of quantitative easing, raising questions about\nwhether a delay in tapering would bring on more dissents.  Opposed Stimulus  Esther George, president of the Kansas City Fed, is the\nonly voting member who has opposed the stimulus this year,\nsaying it may destabilize financial markets and push up long-term inflation. Yet minutes from the June meeting said about\nhalf of the 19 FOMC participants wanted to end the program this\nyear.  \u201cBefore, the message from the Fed seemed be the benefits\noutweighed the cost, while now it is the flipside,\u201d Barker\nsaid, referring to bond purchases. Economic data would have to\nbe \u201catrocious\u201d to prevent a slowing in the pace of purchases\nin September. If data remains weak, Fed officials might opt to\nreduce purchases by $10 billion instead of $20 billion, he said.  The testimony to Congress may be the last for Bernanke,\nwhose second four-year term ends in January. While the Fed chief\nhasn\u2019t commented on his future plans, many congressmen in the\nHouse yesterday paid their respects to Bernanke.  \u201cWhen it\u2019s time for the T-shirts to be passed out at your\nretirement party,\u201d said Representative  Bill Foster , \u201ca very\ngood candidate\u201d would be what the Illinois Democrat called a\n$18 trillion recovery in household net worth brought about by\nBernanke\u2019s policies. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most impressive\nachievements,\u201d Foster said.
