(JPM)  mostly hedges\nsilver for clients, and large speculative bets aren\u2019t \u201cpart of\nour business model,\u201d Blythe Masters, the bank\u2019s head of global\ncommodities, told CNBC.  Market participants \u201cdon\u2019t see all our activity,\u201d and\nbloggers have \u201ca misunderstanding of the nature of our\nbusiness,\u201d Masters said today in an interview on CNBC. There is\n\u201can underlying client position\u201d involved in hedge or forward\ntrades, she said on CNBC.  A multiyear investigation into the possibility of unlawful\nacts in the silver market is continuing after regulators\nanalyzed more than 100,000 documents, the U.S. Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission said in November.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 2.2 percent to close\nat $31.73 an ounce today. The price has dropped 36 percent from\na 31-year high of $49.845 on April 25, 2011.

The banks reduced their collusive trading and their\nholdings in futures market after a government investigation\nbegan in 2008, according to the complaint by Laskaris.
