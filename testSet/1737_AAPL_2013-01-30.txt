 "context": "The following article called 'Apple\u2019s $1 Billion Verdict Against Samsung Left Intact' was published on 2013-01-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s $1.05 billion damages award against  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  from its patent-infringement trial in  San Jose ,  California , was left intact after a judge denied Apple\u2019s bid to increase the award.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose yesterday declined to increase the award after she found Samsung\u2019s infringement wasn\u2019t willful. The ruling was one of many post-trial decisions Koh issued yesterday denying both companies\u2019 bids for a new trial and leaving largely untouched the jury\u2019s finding in August that Samsung infringed six mobile-device patents.  \u201cThe court will not speculate as to how, precisely, the jury calculated its damages award,\u201d Koh wrote in her ruling. It is \u201creasonable to assume\u201d that the award is \u201cintended to compensate Apple for losses stemming from all of the violations the jury found.\u201d  Jurors decided Aug. 24 at the end of a trial that Samsung should pay the $1.05 billion for infringing the six  Apple patents . Apple, which lost its bid to block U.S. sales on 26 of the Galaxy maker\u2019s devices, failed to establish that consumer demand for Samsung products was driven by technology it stole, Koh ruled earlier.  Koh rejected Apple\u2019s argument that jurors erred by finding Apple\u2019s trade dress, or how a product looks, for the iPad and iPad 2 wasn\u2019t protectable. The judge also denied Apple\u2019s request that she overrule jurors\u2019 conclusion that Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab 10.1 didn\u2019t infringe one patent covering the design of Apple\u2019s iPad tablet computer. She found that two claims, or elements, of Samsung\u2019s patent covering data transmission over wireless systems were invalid.  Samsung Loss  The judge also denied Samsung\u2019s request for a new trial. Samsung spokesman  Adam Yates  declined to comment on any of Koh\u2019s rulings, including whether the Suwon, South Korea-based company would attempt to make any new arguments based on the ruling that the infringement wasn\u2019t intentional.  Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, also declined to comment on the rulings.  Koh also rejected Samsung\u2019s argument that Apple\u2019s patents may be \u201cindefinite,\u201d meaning that its claims, or elements, aren\u2019t particular enough in describing the technology they covers.  Samsung rose 2.2 percent today in  Seoul . Apple fell as much as 0.7 percent in trading in  New York  before rising as much as 1 percent to $462.60.  \u2018Slavishly Copying\u2019  Samsung and Apple, which together make about half of the smartphones sold worldwide, have each scored victories in their patent disputes fought over four continents since Apple accused  Asia \u2019s biggest electronics maker of \u201cslavishly copying\u201d its devices. The companies are competing for dominance of a global mobile-device market estimated by  Yankee Group  at $346 billion this year.  At a Dec. 6 hearing, Koh had said that the original award \u201cis not authorized by the law\u201d on some of the products at issue, and that the jury\u2019s method for calculating damages was potentially flawed.  \u201cIf there is enough evidence in the record to justify that damage award then that verdict should be upheld,\u2019 Harold McElhinny, a lawyer for Apple, argued to the judge.  Kathleen Sullivan, a lawyer for Samsung, contended at the hearing that the damages should be reduced by more than $600 million. Sullivan said that while the jury\u2019s calculations were precise, the nine-member panel was hampered by a verdict form that, against Samsung\u2019s wishes, wasn\u2019t \u2018\u2018particularized\u201d enough to permit jurors to properly arrive at damages on a product-by-product basis.  Reverse Engineer  \u201cYou should reverse engineer\u201d to make sure the damages are \u201ccausally connected to the evidence,\u201d Sullivan told the judge.  The patent disputes began when Samsung released its Galaxy smartphones in 2010. Apple co-founder  Steve Jobs , who died Oct. 5, 2011, initiated contact with Samsung over his concerns that the Galaxy phones copied the iPhone, according to testimony from the trial in August.  Jobs later vowed to wage \u201cthermonuclear war\u201d to prove that phones running on  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s Android operating system copy the iPhone. Samsung devices use Android.  Apple\u2019s 2011 suit claimed Samsung products infringe four design patents and three utility, or software, patents. While finding infringement of six patents, the jury concluded that Samsung didn\u2019t infringe one patent covering the design of Apple\u2019s iPad tablet computer.  Apple argued Samsung bet that the benefits of using intellectual property from the iPhone and iPad would outweigh the money damages the jury awarded. Apple urged Koh to increase the damages by $536 million and approve the sales ban because Samsung took market share from Apple by \u201cdeliberately copying the iPhone design,\u201d according to a court filing.  Flooding Market  Apple, in court filings supporting a sales ban, claimed that Samsung started flooding the U.S. market with infringing products at the critical juncture when customers are moving to smartphones and developing \u201cplatform loyalty\u201d that has diminished the base of iPhone users.  The iPhone maker has asked a full panel of judges at the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit in  Washington  to review two appeals seeking to block sales of Samsung products that Apple says violate its patents.  A three-judge Federal Circuit panel said in October that Samsung could continue selling its newest Galaxy Nexus smartphone while battling patent-infringement claims by Apple. To obtain an order that would block sales, Apple must show that the patented search feature under dispute drives consumer demand for the product, the panel said.  The San Jose case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  The appeals in Washington are Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 13-1129, and Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., 12-1507, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington).
