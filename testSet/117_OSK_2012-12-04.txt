The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBillionaire activist investor  Carl\nIcahn  dropped his bid to buy  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK)  after failing to\nreceive enough shareholder support. The stock declined as much\nas 5.6 percent in morning trading.  Icahn, 76, the company\u2019s largest  shareholder  with a 9.5\npercent stake, had said he would end his bid if fewer than a\nquarter of the company\u2019s outstanding shares were tendered by the\ndeadline. About 22 percent of the shares were offered, according\nto a statement from  Icahn Enterprises LP (IEP)  today.  Because he didn\u2019t get the 25 percent of shares sought, \u201cwe\nare returning all tendered shares and we will not extend the\noffer,\u201d Icahn said in the statement.  Icahn\u2019s offer to buy all outstanding shares of the Oshkosh,\nWisconsin-based truckmaker at $32.50 a share, or about $3\nbillion, expired at midnight yesterday.  Oshkosh fell to as low as $28.41 and traded at $28.63, down\n4.9 percent, at 9:43 a.m. in  New York . The stock is up 34\npercent this year. Oshkosh is the U.S. military\u2019s largest\nsupplier of medium- and heavy-duty trucks.  John Daggett, a spokesman for Oshkosh, didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to a phone call seeking comment.  Icahn has criticized Oshkosh\u2019s executives for poor\nperformance. He was seeking to replace its 13-member board of\ndirectors with his own nominees, including himself. He has\npushed for spinning off its JLG unit, which makes construction\nlift equipment.  \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that Icahn had difficulty getting the\nnumber of shares that he wanted to get to proceed with the proxy\nfight,\u201d Walter Liptak, an analyst at Barrington Research\nAssociates Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.\nLiptak has an outperform rating on the company.  \u201cOshkosh management presented a really compelling earnings\ngrowth plan to shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trading today sets\nup a buying opportunity in the stock.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nBrendan McGarry in Washington at \n bmcgarry2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nStephanie Stoughton at \n sstoughton@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Oshkosh Corporation was 26.790903091430664 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Oshkosh Corporation was ",
