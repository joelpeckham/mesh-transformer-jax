 "context": "The following article called 'AIG Said to Mull Leaving Maiden Lane Headquarters' was published on 2012-07-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmerican International Group Inc. (AIG) ,\nthe insurer rescued by U.S. taxpayers, is weighing a move from\nits headquarters at 180 Maiden Lane in lower  Manhattan , said two\npeople with knowledge of the company\u2019s planning.  The approximately 2,000 employees there may be transferred\nto other locations as part of a cost-saving consolidation, said\none of the people, who asked not to be identified because the\ndeliberations are private. An AIG-owned property at 175 Water\nSt., within walking distance from Maiden Lane, is among the\nbuildings that may absorb the workers, the person said.  AIG\u2019s departure would add to  vacancies in lower Manhattan ,\nincluding space in the World Trade Center and World Financial\nCenter. The Maiden Lane property is co-owned by  SL Green Realty\nCorp. (SLG)  and Moinian Group, which have listed about 850,000 square\nfeet (79,000 square meters) in the building as available in May\n2014, according to  CoStar Group Inc. (CSGP)   \u201cThe downtown market is facing an absolute glut of\nspace,\u201d said Aaron Jodka, manager of U.S. market research at\nCoStar, a Washington-based real estate data service. \u201cTenants\nare going to have their choice of space, and it\u2019s going to be\nvery challenging in that environment for landlords to be\naggressively pushing  rents .\u201d  AIG has less need for space as Chief Executive Officer\n Robert Benmosche  shrinks the company and sells units to pay back\na U.S. bailout that swelled to $182.3 billion. The  New York- \nbased insurer had 57,000  employees  worldwide as of Dec. 31, down\nfrom 116,000 three years earlier.  AIG\u2019s Commitment  \u201cNo final decisions have been made regarding the 180\nMaiden Lane lease,\u201d Jim Ankner, a spokesman for AIG, said in a\nphone interview today. \u201cWe are committed to preserving AIG\u2019s\npresence in  New York City .\u201d  Lower Manhattan\u2019s class A office vacancy rate may climb to\n17.4 percent by the end of next year from 8.8 percent at the end\nof June, according to data from Cassidy Turley, a commercial\nproperty brokerage with offices in New York.  One World Trade Center, which the Durst Organization is\nleasing on behalf of owner  Port Authority  of New York and  New\nJersey , has about 45 percent of its 3 million square feet still\nunrented, according to its developers.  Larry Silverstein \u2019s 4\nWorld Trade Center has 1.2 million square feet available, and\nBrookfield Office Properties\u2019s World Financial Center has about\n3 million square feet up for lease after former Merrill Lynch &\nCo. leases expire next year, according to CoStar.  \u2018Actively Exploring\u2019  AIG leased more than 800,000 square feet at 180 Maiden Lane\nas of Dec. 31, SL Green, New York\u2019s largest office landlord,\nsaid in its annual report. When SL Green bought its 49.9 percent\nstake in 180 Maiden last year, it underwrote the deal as if AIG\nwasn\u2019t going to stay, Andrew Mathias, president of New York-\nbased SL Green, said yesterday on a conference call discussing\nsecond-quarter results.  \u201cWe\u2019re actively exploring the possibilities of both a\nredevelopment of the asset and bringing it to the market for new\ntenants,\u201d Mathias said.  \u201cIf there\u2019s any management team out there that will lease\nup their space, I have more confidence in SL Green,\u201d said\nMitchell Germain, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in  New York .\n\u201cThey recognize the market on a positive and on a negative.\nThey see the deficiencies in the market, and they clearly will\nmake sure their product is priced accordingly.\u201d  Tokyo Property  The Maiden Lane property became AIG\u2019s principal office\nafter the company struck a deal in 2009 to sell its previous\nheadquarters at 70 Pine St. to Kumho Investment Bank, a South\nKorean firm, and Youngwoo & Associates, a Manhattan-based\ndeveloper. AIG also sold a Tokyo office property to Nippon Life\nInsurance Co. for about $1.2 billion.  Eric Gerard, a spokesman for Moinian, referred questions\nregarding the AIG lease to SL Green. Heidi Gillette, an SL Green\nspokeswoman, didn\u2019t respond to a voice mail.  AIG has said it\u2019s working to cut general and administrative\nexpenses by about $1 billion from 2010 levels by the end of\n2015. That\u2019s part of aspirational goals AIG laid out in a 2011\nfiling, which include increasing its return on equity to at\nleast 10 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:\nDavid M.
