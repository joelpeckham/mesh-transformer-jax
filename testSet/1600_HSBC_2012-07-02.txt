 "context": "The following article called 'JPMorgan Tightens Bond Grip as Whale Loss Weighs' was published on 2012-07-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is tightening\nits grip on the global corporate  bond market  while  Bank of\nAmerica Corp. (BAC)  sees its market share decline with issuance on\npace to exceed $3 trillion for a fourth straight year.  JPMorgan, the most profitable  U.S. bank , underwrote 6.8\npercent of sales, excluding self-led deals, in the first half of\n2012, up from 6.4 percent in all of 2011, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of\nAmerica dropped to third, with 5.2 percent from 6.1 percent.  Jamie Dimon , JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive officer, is\nbenefiting from debt underwriting as offerings approach $2\ntrillion, including a record $1.19 trillion in the first three\nmonths of the year. The New York-based lender is the top choice\nof companies even as it suffers more than $2 billion of losses\nfrom derivatives tied to corporate credit markets.  \u201cThey have an advantage in the marketplace and they\u2019re\ntaking advantage of it,\u201d  Richard Bove , an analyst with Rochdale\nSecurities LLC in Lutz,  Florida , who recommends the firm\u2019s\nstock, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey have the ability,\ngiven their incredible capital strength, to attract customers\npresumably because their cost of capital is lower,\u201d which they\ncan pass on to clients, he said.  JPMorgan has underwritten $110.9 billion of corporate bonds\nthis year, versus $94.5 billion at New York-based  Citigroup\nInc. (C) , which ranks second with a 5.8 percent share, the data\nshow. Citigroup came in fourth in 2011, with a 5.7 percent\nshare.  \u2018Difficult Markets\u2019  Issuance for the full year in the U.S. and Europe will\nprobably trail 2011, as Europe\u2019s debt crisis threatens global\nmarkets, according to  Barclays Plc (BARC)  strategists.  \u201cJPMorgan tends to do better in more difficult markets,\u201d\n Jim Casey , co-head of global debt capital markets at the bank in\n New York , said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhen the going gets\ntough, some of the smaller players arguably will reduce their\ncapital allocation, whereas we tend not to do that.\u201d  Elsewhere in credit markets, the cost of protecting\ncorporate bonds from default in the U.S. declined for a second\nday, with the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index,\nwhich investors use to hedge against losses or to speculate on\ncreditworthiness, decreasing 1.7 basis points to a mid-price of\n110.6 basis points as of 11:55 a.m. in New York, according to\nprices compiled by Bloomberg.  That\u2019s the lowest level on an intra-day basis since May 14\nfor the index, which typically falls as investor confidence\nimproves and rises as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay\nthe buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its\nobligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point\nequals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of\ndebt.  Citigroup Bonds  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of\nbond market stress, rose 1.66 basis points to 26.16 basis points\nas of 11:58 a.m. in New York. The gauge widens when investors\nseek the perceived safety of  government securities  and narrows\nwhen they favor assets such as corporate bonds.  Bonds of Citigroup are the most actively traded dollar-\ndenominated corporate securities by dealers today, with 38\ntrades of $1 million or more as of 11:57 a.m. in New York,\naccording to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Sales of corporate bonds worldwide declined 10.9 percent\nlast week to $60.1 billion from $67.4 billion in the period\nended June 22, Bloomberg data show. For the first half of the\nyear, issuance fell to $1.93 trillion from $1.99 trillion in the\ncorresponding period of 2011, Bloomberg data show.  Market Share  JPMorgan managed $42.4 billion of offerings last quarter,\nexcluding self-led transactions, a 38 percent decline from $68.5\nbillion in the three months ended March 31, Bloomberg data show.\nThat compares with a 47 percent drop at Bank of America, which\nunderwrote $29.3 billion in the April-through-June period.  \u201cOne of the ways you can grow is by taking share from\nothers, and the investment bank is probably a place where\nJPMorgan is doing this,\u201d Shannon Stemm, an analyst with Edward\nJones & Co. in  St. Louis , said in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019re\nby no means in a strong capital markets environment, but to the\nextent that the economy continues to recover, this segment is a\nrevenue generator, so I think there\u2019s a lot of push to grow.\u201d  John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman at Bank of America, and\nMark Costiglio of Citigroup declined to comment on underwriting\nmarket share.  Investors are pressing leaders in the 17-nation euro region\nto contain a sovereign-debt crisis that\u2019s threatening a\ncontagion across the financial system such as the one that\nfollowed the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  Forecast Lowered  Following a summit last week in Brussels, policy makers\ndropped requirements that taxpayers get preferred-creditor\nstatus on aid to Spain\u2019s banks, opening the way to recapitalize\nlenders directly. Euro chiefs said they\u2019re determined to \u201cbreak\nthe vicious circle between banks and sovereigns\u201d that began in\nGreece in 2009.  While sales of dollar-denominated company debt declined 42\npercent in the second quarter from the three months ended in\nMarch, euro issuance dropped 54 percent as the region\u2019s\nfaltering economy dissuaded borrowers from tapping debt markets.\nThe  European Central Bank  has forecast a 0.1 percent contraction\nin the euro-area economy for 2012.  Citigroup strategists led by Jason Shoup revised their\nissuance estimate for investment-grade debt to $827 billion in\n2012, including $462 billion from non-financial companies,\naccording to a June 29 report. That\u2019s down from a January\nestimate of $855 billion with $490 billion from non-financials.  London Whale  \u201cFor some credits, it\u2019s currently easier to do a deal in\nthe U.S. than in Europe,\u201d said Chris Whitman, head of global\nrisk syndicate at  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , which ranks fourth in global\nunderwriting with a 5.2 percent share, down from 5.9 percent in\n2011 and coming in third. \u201cThe U.S. benefits from a bigger and\ndeeper credit market.\u201d  Investors added $57 billion to U.S. fixed-income mutual\nfunds in the second quarter, compared with $2.3 billion of\noutflows from European funds, according EPFR Global data.  \u201cThe U.S. market has been the most consistently liquid\nmarket,\u201d Huw Richards, co-head of investment-grade finance at\nJPMorgan in New York, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s\nno doubt that having insight on those investor flows, we\u2019re\ndefinitely able to translate that into international borrowers\u201d\ncoming to market to issue dollar-denominated debt.  JPMorgan\u2019s share has increased even as it faces\nCongressional scrutiny after its London chief investment office\nbuilt a portfolio of  credit derivatives  so large it distorted\nprices and earned trader Bruno Iksil a nickname: the London\nWhale.  \u2018Short-Term Blow\u2019  At the start of the year, the group was ordered to reduce\nits positions and instead executed a series of trades that left\nthe bank with even bigger and harder-to-manage exposures, Dimon\ntold the Senate Banking Committee in Washington last month.  While the losses amount to \u201ca short-term blow to their\nreputation,\u201d it probably won\u2019t be a meaningful problem in the\nlong run, Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic\nEquities LLP who recommends JPMorgan stock, said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cLooking across the investment banking landscape,\nJPMorgan is one of the best placed to pick up market share\u201d as\nEuropean competitors cut employees, he said.  Rounding out the top 10 underwriters, excluding self-led\ndeals, are Barclays at No. 5; HSBC Holdings Plc. at No. 6;\n Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  at No. 7;  Morgan Stanley (MS)  at No. 8;  UBS\nAG (UBSN)  at No. 9; and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  at No. 10 with a 3.3\npercent share.
