The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA runaway oil train that killed\nscores of people when it slammed into a Quebec town is bringing\nrenewed calls on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border for\ntougher safety rules for railroads.  Regulators and watchdogs have sought for years improvements\nto a common tank car design shown to be susceptible to rupture\nwhen derailed, while labor unions have pushed for a ban on\ntrains being operated by a single crew member.  Both issues have been cited as potentially contributing to\nthe July 6 crash of a  Montreal  Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd.\ntrain that derailed in Lac-Megantic, about 250 kilometers (155\nmiles) east of Montreal. The accident incinerated 30 buildings\nin the town\u2019s center and killed as many as 50 people. Canadian\ninvestigators are still probing the cause of what is the\nnation\u2019s worst rail disaster in more than a century.  \u201cMajor disasters like this often reveal regulatory\nfailures or highlight gaps in regulatory coverage,\u201d said Katie\nGreenhaw, regulatory policy analyst at the Center for Effective\nGovernment, a Washington-based watchdog. \u201cOther times it shows\nthat there\u2019s lax enforcement of existing regulations.\u201d  In Canada, the opposition New Democratic Party is calling\nfor a minimum of two crew members on trains carrying dangerous\ngoods, and a deadline for retiring DOT-111 tank cars, the model\nthat regulators and watchdogs have repeatedly cited and was used\non the MM&A train. Party member and Canadian lawmaker Olivia Chow said municipalities should also know when and where\ndangerous goods are traveling by rail through their towns.  Cost Increase  Regulations on rail shipments of crude oil are likely to\ntighten in the wake of the accident, raising operating costs,\nMoody\u2019s Investor Service said in a July 11 research note.  \u201cCanadian and U.S. authorities are likely to increase the\nregulatory burden on rail shipments of crude and petroleum\nproducts, increasing capital and operating costs for rail\ncompanies,\u201d according to Moody\u2019s note. \u201cPast rail accidents\nand catastrophic oil spills have led to strong and costly new\nregulations.\u201d  CSX Corp. (CSX)  Chief Executive Officer Michael Ward today\nfielded a question from an analyst who asked whether the Quebec\naccident may lead to more regulation.  CSX Reaction  \u201cThey\u2019re still investigating what the cause of it is, and\nI think until the cause is known it\u2019s a little hard to speculate\nwhether there would be additional regulations or not,\u201d Ward\nsaid on a conference call after the Jacksonville, Florida-based\ncompany reported second-quarter results. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that as\nthey determine the cause of this, if there\u2019s something to be\nlearned to make us safer, we want to learn from that.\u201d  Labor unions in both countries say they plan to redouble\nefforts to convince regulators to ban one-person train crews.\nThe MM&A train was operated by a single engineer, who parked the\ntrain for the night and left it unattended. A second person can\nensure procedures are followed in operating and parking trains.  In the U.S., while no regulation or law bans the use of\none-person rail crews, regulations dictating what the engineer\nand conductor do in the locomotive effectively prohibit the\npractice. Collective bargaining agreements between more than a\ndozen rail-worker unions and the railroads who employ them have\nkept two operators in most trains running in the U.S.  Union Plans  Some short-line and non-union trains run with a single\noperator, and larger railroads in collective bargaining have\nsought support for one-person crews.  \u201cRail safety is not just an employee issue,\u201d said James\nStem, national legislative director for the Sheet Metal, Air,\nRail and Transportation union\u2019s transportation division, which\nwas formerly the United Transportation Union. \u201cRail safety\nimpacts every community that railroads go through.\u201d  Stem said his union, which represents railroad conductors,\nand the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, may\nre-file a petition with the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration\nasking the agency to require multiple-person operating crews\nrather than leaving the decision to railroads and unions to work\nout at the bargaining table.  \u201cThere\u2019s a certain period of time when the event is still\nfresh in the mind of the public and action is indeed a\npossibility,\u201d said Lloyd Burton, a University of Colorado-Denver law and public policy professor who published a 2011\npaper on railroad regulation following disaster.  Operator Error  MM&A owner Edward Burkhardt, who has defended the single-operator model as safer because there are fewer distractions,\nblamed the train\u2019s engineer for failing to properly set the\nbrakes on the parked train. Since the accident, he has said the\nrailroad would no longer leave trains unattended overnight.  Claiming operator error is a common way for companies and\nregulators to deflect responsibility, Burton said. Blaming the\noperator shields industries and regulatory agencies from\naccident investigations that might result in systemic reforms,\nhe said.  \u201cHuman operator error is typically the first -- and most\nagencies and firms hope -- the last organizational refuge after\nan accident,\u201d he wrote in the paper. \u201cThe logic is that if the\nhuman operator failed in his duties -- to err, after all, is\nhuman -- then the system itself must not be broken.\u201d  Thicker Shells  The accident will renew attention on a  rule  on railcar\ndesign that\u2019s languished at the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous\nMaterials Safety Administration, Burton said. The U.S. National\nTransportation Safety Board, which can only suggest regulations,\nhas warned that the 30,000 gallon-tank cars are more prone to\nrupture in crashes than other types of tank cars.  The agency recommended thicker shells and other\nmodifications to strengthen the rail cars. If retrofits couldn\u2019t\nbe done, the NTSB suggested phasing out the use of the DOT-111\nfor transporting hazardous materials.  As early as 1994 the Canadian Transport Safety Board cited\nthe equipment as prone to puncture during a derailment.  The rail industry has opposed requirements to retrofit\ncars, saying they could cost as much as $1 billion. The\nWashington-based Association of American Railroads has supported\nupdated rules for new tank cars and worked with manufacturers on\nsafety improvements.  \u2018Closely Monitoring\u2019  \u201cWe learn from every accident and use this knowledge to\ncontinuously improve our safety program,\u201d Kevin F. Thompson, a\nspokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration, said in an e-mail. \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation in  Canada , and\nwill continue to learn from the accident as Canadian authorities\ncomplete their investigation.\u201d  In a July 8 statement, then-transport minister Denis Lebel\nsaid he asked the department to \u201cexamine any other means of\nimproving rail safety over the coming weeks, months and years.\u201d  \u201cWe have taken concrete action to increase rail safety. In\nfact, we have invested over C$100 million ($96.3 million) in\nrail safety since 2009,\u201d Lebel said in a July 8 press\nconference. Lebel was replaced July 15 by Conservative lawmaker\nLisa Raitt as part of a cabinet-wide shuffle in Canada.  The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee is expecting a report\nthis year it requested from the Government Accountability Office\nreviewing freight rail safety and the agencies that oversee\nrailroads, said Kevin McAlister, a spokesman for the committee.  Train Control  The disaster may affect the pace of implementing positive\ntrain control technology, a centralized electronic communication\nsystem that keeps trains from speeding or running into each\nother. Railroads that operate in the U.S. have a 2015 deadline\nto install the technology on about 39 percent of track miles.\nThe Association of American Railroads, which represents all the\nmajor railroads operating in the U.S., has asked for a delay to\nthe deadline, saying the demand for the equipment will outstrip\nsupply between now and then.  \u201cA lot went wrong and a lot of lives have been lost and\nthings are going to change,\u201d said Steven Paget, an analyst\nbased in Calgary with FirstEnergy Capital Corp. \u201cThere is going\nto be increased public attention on rail transportation.\u201d  The Association of American Railroads considers it\n\u201cpremature to speculate about how and if this accident could\ninfluence future regulations or changes to railroad operating\nprocedures,\u201d said Holly Arthur, a spokeswoman. The group will\nfollow investigators\u2019 findings, she said.  Effective Regulation  \u201cRailroads have long told investors that safety is good\nbusiness,\u201d Anthony Hatch, an independent analyst based in New\nYork who has tracked railroad companies for almost three\ndecades, said in a telephone interview. \u201cYou cannot afford to\nhave derailments on the main line take the main line out of\nservice for any period of time. You\u2019re eating up capacity. If\nyou\u2019re running unsafe, you\u2019re running a very costly railroad.\u201d  A disaster points to the need for effective regulation\nbefore more people are killed or injured, said Greenhaw, with\nthe Center for Effective Government.  \u201cThe important thing is to not forget to urge our\npolicymakers to provide these safeguards, sufficiently provide\nresources for the agencies that need to implement these\nsafeguards so we don\u2019t forget about them until a situation like\nthis happens,\u201d she said.
