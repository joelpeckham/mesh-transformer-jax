 "context": "The following article called 'Korea Sovereign Wealth Fund CIO Says Europe Assets \u2018Attractive\u2019' was published on 2012-01-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nKorea Investment Corp. (KRINVTZ) , the nation\u2019s\n$43 billion sovereign wealth fund, said European assets are\n\u201cattractive\u201d amid the region\u2019s sovereign debt crisis, and it\nplans to buy more real estate.  Europe  \u201cgot to sell off assets to try to alleviate the\nburden,\u201d Chief Investment Officer Scott Kalb said in an\ninterview in Seoul yesterday. \u201cWe just want to be in a position\nto buy those assets when attractive opportunities arise. We want\nto be ready to take advantage of it.\u201d  The region\u2019s state-owned investment companies such as\n Singapore \u2019s Temasek Holdings Pte and China Investment Corp. are\ndiversifying assets as European\u2019s debt problems and the U.S.\neconomic slowdown threaten to dent returns in 2011 when global\nstocks had their worst performance since 2008.  The South Korean sovereign wealth fund, also known as KIC,\nspent about 70 million pounds ($108 million) last month to buy a\nbuilding in  London \u2019s financial district to diversify its\nportfolio from bonds and stocks. The Seoul-based fund, which\nrefers to property assets as real assets, wants to at least\ndouble the portion of such \u201cnon-traditional\u201d investments over\nthe long term from about 10 percent currently, Kalb said.  \u201cThe real asset is an important part of the\ndiversification of our portfolio,\u201d said the CIO, whose term is\nset to end in April. \u201cReal assets provide you with a steady,\nstable source of  cash flow . It also provides you with some kind\nof inflation hedge, the protection from inflation.\u201d  European Banks  To kick off its real-estate investments, the fund will look\ninto small-scale purchases, he said, without elaborating on\nspecific regions.  Kalb ruled out any takeover of European banks, citing the\nongoing sovereign debt crisis and stricter capital rules set by\nglobal regulators under Basel III.  \u201cEuropean banks have to raise a lot of capital,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to see the situation stabilize.\u201d There will be a\nlot of pressure on the European banking sector, he added.  \u201cWe\u2019re not rushing out to buy European banks,\u201d Kalb said.  KIC added $78 million worth of  Bank of America Corp.  shares\nto its existing stake last year as the  Charlotte , North\nCarolina-based bank shed more than half its market value, the\nfund said in August. The fund added shares from January via\nseven separate purchases using a $145 million dividend.  Bank of America  KIC initially bought a $2 billion stake in Merrill Lynch &\nCo. in February 2008, months before the firm was forced to sell\nitself to Bank of America. The fund  held  72.6 million shares, or\na 0.72 percent stake, in Bank of America as of Sept. 30,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  South Korea \u2019s  Board of Audit and Inspection  in 2010 said\nthe fund should be sanctioned over losses from the purchase,\ncalling KIC\u2019s investment decision hasty and based on\n\u201cinadequate\u201d  risk assessment .  Kalb said it is not the right time to exit the fund\u2019s four-\nyear-old investment in the bank, and improvements in the  U.S.\neconomy  and financial industry will be the \u201ceffectors\u201d to\ndetermine the timing of a sale of the stake.  \u201cOver time, the prospects of Bank of America are bright,\u201d\nsaid Kalb. \u201cIt has unmatched franchise in the U.S. As we get a\nrecovery in the U.S. and the global economy, we think Bank of\nAmerica will do fine.\u201d  Fund Returns  The sovereign wealth fund had a minus 3.3 percent return\nfrom investing in stocks and bonds last year due to the global\nequity market rout, Kalb said. The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  declined 7.6\npercent last year, its first drop in three years.  The weak result is a \u201cnormal part\u201d of the investment\ncycle for a long-term investor, he said. KIC had a 2.9 percent\nreturn from those assets on a compound average annual basis,\nwhich is good, given the fund is so new, he said.  The fund, established in July 2005 to invest part of South\nKorea\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves overseas, posted returns of\n8.46 percent from bonds and stocks in 2010, down from 18.67\npercent in the previous year, according to its annual report\npublished in June.  \u201cAs a long-term investor and sovereign wealth fund, our\njob is to create wealth over time, not all the time, not every\nminute,\u201d said Kalb, who started at KIC in April 2009 with\nthree-year term. \u201cWe expect a better performance this year.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSeonjin Cha in  Seoul  at \n scha2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChitra Somayaji at \n csomayaji@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 29.858049392700195 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
