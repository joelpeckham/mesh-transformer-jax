 "context": "The following article called 'Sales of Existing U.S. Homes at 10-Month High a Sign of Recovery: Economy' was published on 2011-12-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSales of existing homes in the U.S.\nrose in November to a 10-month high, showing demand may be\nstarting to stabilize following a plunge over the past four\nyears that was steeper than previously calculated.  Purchases  climbed 4 percent to a 4.42 million annual pace,\nthe most since January, the National Association of Realtors\nsaid today in  Washington . The group revised down figures going\nback to 2007 by an average 14 percent, putting them more in line\nwith other measures of demand.  \u201cPerhaps signs of life are increasing for the housing\nmarket,\u201d said Ellen Zentner, a senior U.S. economist at Nomura\nSecurities International Inc. in New York, who forecast a sales\nrate of 4.4 million for last month. \u201cHousing is finally not\ngoing to be a drag on economic growth in 2012. That\u2019s not to say\nthat risks don\u2019t abound. We know that there\u2019s a substantial\nshadow inventory of distressed properties that we\u2019re still\nwaiting to come onto the market.\u201d  Housing, which helped trigger the 18-month recession that\nbegan in December 2007 as subprime borrowers defaulted, may be\nsteadying as builder confidence improves and construction picks\nup. The NAR revisions also reduced the number of unsold houses\non the market, pushing inventory last month to the lowest level\nin six years and indicating there may be less pressure on\nproperty values in coming years even as more foreclosures loom.  Stocks fell, following yesterday\u2019s rally, as Oracle Corp.\ntumbled on disappointing earnings and optimism faded about the\n European Central Bank \u2019s plan to lend euro-area banks a record\namount for three years. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index dropped\n0.3 percent to 1,237.55 at 2:12 p.m. in New York.  Possible Recession  The Italian economy contracted in the third quarter,\nsignaling the country may have entered its fifth recession since\n2001 as the government adopts new austerity measures that will\nfurther weigh on growth. Gross domestic product declined 0.2\npercent from the second quarter, when it expanded 0.3 percent,\nnational statistics institute Istat said in  Rome  today. It was\nthe first contraction since the final three months of 2009.  Japan \u2019s exports fell and the central bank lowered its\nassessment of the economy for a second straight month as\nweakening demand in Europe and  Asia  weigh on the outlook for\nglobal growth. Shipments dropped a more-than-expected 4.5\npercent in November from a year earlier, a Ministry of Finance\nreport showed today in  Tokyo .  Survey Results  The  median estimate  of 71 economists surveyed by Bloomberg\nNews called for a 5.05 million pace in November existing home\nsales. Forecasts ranged from 4.38 million to 5.25 million, a\nwider-than-usual range because some took into account\nassumptions for the benchmark revisions and others didn\u2019t.\nOctober\u2019s reading was revised down to a 4.25 million rate from a\nprevious estimate of 4.97 million, reflecting the NAR\u2019s\nbenchmark updates.  Total purchases  were revised to 4.19 million for 2010, down\n15 percent from a prior estimate of 4.91 million. Sales were\ntrimmed by 16 percent for 2009, by 16 percent for 2008 and by 11\npercent for 2007.  \u201cBefore the revisions things were bad, now they are even\nworse,\u201d  Lawrence Yun , the group\u2019s chief economist, said in a\nnews conference today as the figures were released.  Figures from other trackers of home sales showed a slower\npace of purchases compared with NAR, prompting the agents\u2019 group\nto revisit their data. CoreLogic Inc., a real-estate analytics\ncompany, released a report in February showing that 3.3 million\nexisting homes were sold in 2010, less than the 4.91 million\ninitially tallied by NAR.  Independent Data  CoreLogic, based in  Santa Ana ,  California , monitors sales\nfigures through property records at local courthouses, while NAR\nfollows sales through the multiple-listing services used by\nreal-estate agents. The property-deed records contain \u201chuge\nstatistical noise,\u201d said Yun, making CoreLogic\u2019s numbers too\nlow.  NAR tallies in recent years were overstated because the\nconsolidation of multiple listing services caused distortions in\nthe data, according to Yun. He said overestimates of direct\nsales by owners and home builders\u2019 use of the listing services\nto sell new homes also helped inflate the data.  There were comparable downward revisions to inventory, and\nmedian prices were little changed from prior estimates, the\nreport showed. That suggests the decline in property values from\nthe 2006 peak has done less to spur demand, said  Michelle Meyer ,\na senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Corp. in  New York .  \u201cThe big take-away is that there was an even bigger gap\nbetween affordability and housing demand, making it even more\ndifficult to trigger the rebound,\u201d Meyer said in an interview.  Year-to-Year Gain  Existing-home sales, tabulated when a contract closes, rose\n11 percent from the same month last year before adjusting for\nseasonal variations. Annual sales peaked at 7.08 million in 2005\nduring the housing boom.  The number of previously owned homes on the market dropped\nto 2.58 million in November, the fewest since May 2005, from\n2.74 million the prior month, today\u2019s report showed.  At the current sales pace, it would take 7 months to sell\nthose houses, a two-year low and down from 7.7 months at the end\nof October. A range of seven months to eight months supply is\nnormally consistent with stable  home prices , NAR\u2019s Yun said,\nadding that he thought property values will probably climb in\n\u201csingle digits\u201d next year.  \u201cThe overhang of inventories in the housing market is\nclearing more quickly than previously thought, and that could\nlead to a firming up of home prices,\u201d said Nomura\u2019s Zentner.  Broad-Based Gain  Purchases climbed in all four regions last month, led by a\n9.8 percent gain in the Northeast.  Sales of existing single-family homes increased 4.5 percent\nto an annual rate of 3.95 million. Purchases of multifamily\nproperties, including condominiums and townhouses, were little\nchanged at a 470,000 pace.  The  median price  of a previously owned home decreased 3.5\npercent to $164,200 from $170,200 in November 2010, today\u2019s\nreport showed.  The Obama administration this month started a new version of\nthe federal Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, after\nthe original plan helped less than a quarter of the people\ntargeted to lock in lower  mortgage rates .  Federal Reserve policy makers reiterated at a meeting this\nmonth that they will keep the benchmark  interest rate  near zero\nuntil at least mid-2013. The central bank in September decided\nto reinvest maturing housing debt into new mortgage-backed\nsecurities instead of Treasuries.  Some homebuilders said they see signs of optimism in the\nhousing market.  \u201cNovember is a time that historically sales slow down,\u201d\n Larry Sorsby , chief financial officer at builder  Hovnanian\nEnterprises Inc. (HOV) , said on a Dec. 15 call with analysts. \u201cAnd\nthis year we\u2019ve not seen as dramatic a slowdown as we have in\nrecent prior years. The market feels a little bit better than we\nwould have expected.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nTimothy R.
