The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTwo men were indicted on conspiracy,\nsecurities fraud and wire fraud charges for allegedly cheating\ninvestors by operating a phony New York-based hedge fund.  William Shternfeld and Benjamin Koifman operated A.R.\nCapital Global Fund LP, an unregistered investment adviser, and\nARC Global Fund, a purported hedge fund that invested primarily\nin equity of international real estate, prosecutors in the\noffice of Manhattan U.S. Attorney  Preet Bharara  said today.  From 2004 to 2006, Shternfeld and Koifman allegedly engaged\nin a scheme with unidentified co-conspirators to induce at least\n70 investors to invest about $20 million in the ARC Global Fund\nby making false statements about it.  The U.S. didn\u2019t specify the amount of investor losses,\nsaying only that one individual invested \u201cmillions\u201d in the\nfunds and a second invested more than $1.8 million.  On Dec. 1, two other men, Igor Levin, 40, of Brooklyn, New\nYork, and Yevgeny Shvartsshteyn, 40, of Belle Harbor, New York,\npleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and\nwire fraud before U.S. Magistrate Judge  Ronald Ellis .  The two said they ran A.R. Capital, a general partner of\nA.R. Capital Global Fund LP, which they described as a hedge\nfund that invested primarily in equity of international real\nestate, oil, gas and other commodities, according to a statement\nfrom Bharara\u2019s office.  No Such Investments  The U.S. said that, in reality, there were no such\ninvestments and more than $7 million of investor funds were\nwired instead to various bank accounts in the Ukraine. Levin and\nShvartsshteyn received the proceeds from these illegally\nobtained investments, prosecutors said.  Levin and Shvartsshteyn both face as many as 20 years in\nprison when they are sentenced by U.S. District Judge  Sidney Stein  in New York Feb. 25.  Shternfeld and Koifman appeared today before U.S.\nMagistrate Judge  Henry Pitman  in New York, who agreed to release\nthem on $500,000 bond secured by $25,000 in cash and property.\nThey are scheduled to appear at a hearing before U.S. District\nJudge Sidney Stein on Jan. 3.  Arthur Gershfeld, a lawyer representing both men, declined\nto comment on the charges after court today.  The case is U.S. v. Shternfeld, 10-cr-00031, U.S. District\nCourt, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
