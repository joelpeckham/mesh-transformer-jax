(BAC)  is this year\u2019s\nworst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as concern\nabout mounting mortgage losses and a global economic slowdown\nweighed on the second-biggest U.S. lender.  The 58 percent decline erased almost $80 billion of\nshareholder value at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of\nAmerica. It\u2019s the firm\u2019s largest drop since a 66 percent plunge\nin 2008, when a U.S. bailout staved off a collapse. The bank\nalso ended 2011 last in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Financials\nIndex and the KBW Bank Index.  \u201cWhat you have is like a three-ring circus, and in all the\nrings for Bank of America, the show isn\u2019t any good,\u201d said Greg Donaldson, chairman of Evansville, Indiana-based Donaldson\nCapital Management LLC, which oversees $500 million including\nBank of America shares. He cited new regulations, mounting costs\nof bad loans and a lack of confidence in management. \u201cYou just\ngot one surprise after another this year,\u201d Donaldson said.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 52, told his\nstaff in a year-end progress report last week that his effort to\nboost the company\u2019s value \u201cis not yet translating into returns\nfor our shareholders.\u201d Moynihan said he has prepared for\nturmoil ahead by selling assets, reducing mortgage and credit-\ncard loans and pledging to lower annual costs by $5 billion,\nincluding about 30,000 job cuts.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 5.5 percent this\nyear, led by  McDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD) \u2019s 31 percent advance, while the\n80-company  S&P Financials (S5FINL)  slid 18 percent and the 24-member KBW\nBank Index lost 25 percent.  Larry DiRita , a Bank of America\nspokesman, declined to comment.  List of Laggards  Some of Bank of America\u2019s biggest peers also made the list\nof laggards, with  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest U.S. bank by\nassets, dropping 44 percent.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest\nlender, slid 22 percent.  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the\ninsurer owned mostly by the U.S. after its near-collapse in\n2008, fell 52 percent for the second-worst showing in the S&P\nFinancials, and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  lost 46 percent.  Moynihan is trying to reverse a stock decline that began\nsoon after he replaced  Kenneth D. Lewis  at the end of 2009, when\nthe bank also repaid $45 billion of U.S. bailout funds. The\ncompany\u2019s shares, which reached $19.48 in April 2010, closed at\n$5.56 at 4:15 p.m., as settlements with mortgage-bond investors\nand insurers failed to stanch losses tied to the 2008 takeover\nof subprime lender Countrywide Financial Corp.  Subprime Mortgages  The status of an $8.5 billion accord resolving some claims\nfrom mortgage-bond buyers including BlackRock Inc. and Pacific\nInvestment Management Co. is being contested by outside\ninvestors and may be tied up in courts through 2012. Meanwhile,\nU.S.-owned mortgage firm Fannie Mae has stepped up demands that\nBank of America repurchase defective loans.  \u201cThey have this big exposure to  subprime mortgages (DLQTDLQT) , to\npotentially settling with buyers of securitized subprime and\nbuying back loans that were improperly\u201d bundled into bonds,\nsaid Steven Persky, who oversees $1.4 billion in equities and\ndistressed debt as CEO of Los Angeles-based Dalton Investments\nLLC. \u201cBank of America is too big to fail, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d\nwant to be an equity holder.\u201d  Banks are grappling with more stringent requirements for\ncapital and new limits on fees at the same time the European\nsovereign debt crisis threatens to derail the global economic\nrecovery. A $5 billion investment by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire\nHathaway Inc. announced in August only temporarily arrested a\nslide triggered that month after markets were roiled by  Standard\n& Poor\u2019s  downgrade of the U.S. government\u2019s debt.  Five Dollars  The stock\u2019s drop has stung investors including  Bruce Berkowitz , whose Fairholme Capital Management LLC owned 105\nmillion shares as of Sept. 30, and  John Paulson , whose hedge\nfund held 64.3 million shares, according to Bloomberg data.  This month, Bank of America shares sold below $5 for the\nfirst time since March 2009 as concern over Europe\u2019s debt crisis\nintensified. A sustained decline below $5 in 2012 could reduce\nthe bank\u2019s appeal to investors, said Eric Teal, chief investment\nofficer at First Citizens Bancshares Inc., which manages $4\nbillion in Raleigh,  North Carolina .  Moynihan has said that while he is confident the bank can\nwithstand fallout from  Europe , growth in the U.S. may be slowed\nif a European nation defaults on its debts.  Bank of America had about $363 billion of cash as of Sept.\n30, enough to fund operations for two years without going to the\nmarkets. The company also has been reducing risk related to the\nweakest European nations, Chief Financial Officer  Bruce Thompson \nsaid in October.  \u201cThe market has given up on Moynihan, given up on their\nstory,\u201d Donaldson said. \u201cI may start buying Bank of America\nshares soon. It\u2019s priced as if it\u2019s going out of business, and\nit\u2019s not going out of business.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nHugh Son in New York at   hson1@bloomberg.net ;  To contact the editors responsible for this story:\n Rick Green  at \n rgreen18@bloomberg.net ;\nNick Baker at \n nbaker7@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 25.220365524291992 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
