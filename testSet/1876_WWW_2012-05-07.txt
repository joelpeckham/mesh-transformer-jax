 "context": "The following article called 'Collective Brands Sued by Investor Over Sale to Wolverine' was published on 2012-05-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCollective Brands Inc. (PSS)  was sued by an\ninvestor seeking to block the shoe retailer\u2019s proposed sale to\n Wolverine World Wide Inc. (WWW) , Blum Capital Partners LP and Golden\nGate Capital Corp. for about $2 billion including debt.  Gregory Dusablon contends in a Delaware Chancery Court\ncomplaint made public today in Wilmington that Collective\u2019s\ndirectors are duty-bound to get the best price for the company\nand wrongly accepted too low a bid. The buyout group offered\n$21.75 a share in cash.  The deal \u201cdeprives Collective Brands\u2019 public shareholders\nof the ability to participate in the company\u2019s long term\nprospects,\u201d Dusablon said in court papers. He asked a judge to\nhalt the transaction and award damages.  Collective, based in Topeka,  Kansas , sells footwear under\nbrands including Sperry Top-Sider, Saucony,  Stride Rite  and\nKeds. The deal will combine those brands with Wolverine\u2019s\nSebago, Caterpillar and Hush Puppies brands, the Rockford,\nMichigan-based buyer said in a May 1 statement.  A takeover of Collective would be the largest of a U.S.\nfootwear company since  VF Corp. (VFC)  paid $1.97 billion for\nTimberland Co. last September, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. The transaction is expected to be completed in the\nthird or early fourth quarter, Collective said.  Collective Loss  Collective said after reporting a $35 million  loss  in\nAugust that it would review strategic alternatives and shut 475\nstores in the following three years. The company\u2019s loss for the\nyear ended Jan. 28 was $164.5 million, compared with a\n$112.8 million profit a year earlier.  Payless ShoeSource Inc. became Collective Brands after\nacquiring Stride Rite Corp. in August 2007.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Wells Fargo & Co . have committed\nto provide $1.73 billion in loans to back the deal. The\nfinancing comprises a $900 million senior secured  term loan , a\n$200 million revolving line of credit, a $375 million bridge\nfacility and a $250 million portion that will be secured by the\ncompany\u2019s receivables, Collective said May 2 in a regulatory\nfiling.  Stephanie Waugh, a spokeswoman for Collective, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to a phone call or e-mail seeking comment on\nthe lawsuit.  Collective  was unchanged  at $21.25 in  New York  Stock\nExchange composite trading at 12:55 p.m. The shares have gained\n48 percent this year.  The case is Dusablon v.
