The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChinese social-network operators\n Renren Inc. (RENN)  and  Sina Corp. (SINA)  can\u2019t rely on  Facebook Inc. (FB) \u2019s initial\npublic offering to boost their shares as both face challenges\nattracting advertisers, according to Maxim Group LLC.  Renren, which completed an $855 million IPO last year, and\nSina, owner of the Twitter-like  Weibo  site in  China , jumped in\nNew York trading on Feb. 2, the day after the world\u2019s most\npopular social network announced plans to raise $5 billion in an\nIPO this year. American depositary receipts of Beijing-based\nRenren have climbed 49 percent in 2012 while  Sina (SINA) , based in\n Shanghai , has erased 2011\u2019s 24 percent slump to gain 35 percent.  \u201cThere could be a short-term bounce from the Facebook IPO\nbut it\u2019s not sustainable,\u201d Echo He, a New York-based analyst\nwho covers Chinese Internet stocks for Maxim Group, said in an\ninterview. \u201cRenren has a lot of promise but online advertising\ndollars are hard to make in China. Advertising in China is still\nTV dominant.\u201d  More than $68 billion was spent on  TV advertising  in China\nlast year, accounting for more than 75 percent of ad spending in\ntraditional media, excluding online, according to  CTR\nMarketresearch Co.  Renren, which got 42 percent of 2010  revenue \nfrom ads, said this month the market has got off to a \u201cslow\nstart\u201d in 2012 because of China\u2019s  economic slowdown . Sina\nearned 76 percent of revenue from ads last year and said in\nFebruary that ad sales this quarter will be \u201cdisappointing\u201d as\ncustomers cut spending.  Sell Recommendation  Maxim\u2019s He has had a sell rating on  Renren (RENN)  since Feb. 3 and\non  Sina (SINA)  since October last year, data compiled by Bloomberg\nshow. Renren, which fell 0.4 percent to $5.30 in  New York  today,\nwill slip to $4.50 over the next 12 months, while Sina will\ntumble to $51, from $70.75, He said.  China\u2019s economy  grew 8.9 percent in the last three months\nof 2011, the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2009, as\n Europe \u2019s debt crisis and a lackluster recovery in the U.S.\nsubdued demand for exports. Premier  Wen Jiabao  cut China\u2019s\neconomic growth goal to 7.5 percent for 2012 on March 5, down\nfrom 8 percent over the past seven years.  Renren reported an unaudited operating loss of $19.7\nmillion for the fourth quarter, compared with operating income\nof $2.3 million in the same period of 2010, as the company\nboosted name-recognition advertising and increased the sales\nforce for its Nuomi e-commerce venture, according to a March 8\nstatement.  The  site , whose name means \u201ceveryone\u201d in Chinese and\nwhich is targeted at the student market, is  not expected  to be\nprofitable this year, according to the average forecast of 10\nanalysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  \u2018Not Apples-to-Apples\u2019  Facebook\u2019s success -- it has 845 million members worldwide\nand founder  Mark Zuckerberg  said in 2010 that it\u2019s \u201calmost a\nguarantee\u201d that it will achieve 1 billion users -- has yet to\nbe replicated by China\u2019s social networking sites, said Qi Guo,\nan analyst at ThinkEquity LLC in  San Francisco .  \u201cRenren and Sina\u2019s Weibo are still in the early stages of\ndevelopment, so it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison with\nFacebook,\u201d said Guo, who has rated Sina a buy since October and\ndoesn\u2019t cover Renren.  Sam Lawn, Renren\u2019s investor relations director, didn\u2019t\nanswer calls to his office in Beijing after hours. Sina\u2019s\nspokeswoman Cathy Peng also didn\u2019t pick up calls in the capital.  Sina said on Feb. 28 that Weibo, which means \u201cmicroblog\u201d\nin Chinese, had more than 300 million registered users. Renren\u2019s\nuser base will grow to about 200 million in 2012, Chief\nExecutive Officer Joseph Chen said in a Feb. 14. interview.  Potential Acquisitions  Renren will post \u201chealthy growth\u201d this year from its\nNuomi e-commerce site, Chen said, adding that the company \u201cwill\nnot hesitate\u201d to make acquisitions to gain new technology.\nRenren bought online video website 56.com for $80 million last\nyear, and has cash holdings of about $1.2 billion.  \u201cIf the Facebook IPO is successful, the social networking\nspace in China will get a bounce,\u201d Andy Yeung, a New York-based\nanalyst for Oppenheimer & Co. said in a phone interview.\n\u201cRegardless of the Facebook IPO, Renren\u2019s advertising revenue\nwill remain strong in 2012 and their online gaming business will\nprobably see some re-acceleration this year as well.\u201d  Renren\u2019s revenue from online games was $12 million in the\nfourth quarter, up 39 percent from the same period of 2010, as\nthe company started and promoted new games, Chief Financial\nOfficer Huang Hui said on a March 8 earnings conference call.  Yeung rates Renren outperform, meaning he expects it to\ngain more than the market, with a 12-month price target of $8.  Renren and Sina also compete with the Pengyou social\nnetworking service operated by  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) , China\u2019s\nbiggest Internet company by sales. Tencent stock traded in  Hong\nKong  added 3 percent to HK$223.40 today and is up 43 percent in\n2012.
