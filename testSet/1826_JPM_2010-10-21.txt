 "context": "The following article called 'Arcor Tops Government in Bond Market With Overseas Sales: Argentina Credit' was published on 2010-10-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nArcor SAIC , Argentina\u2019s biggest\ncandy maker, may parlay its international operations into lower\nborrowing costs than the government.  Arcor may sell $200 million of bonds due in 2017 at a yield\nas low as 8 percent, or 62 basis points less than similar-\nmaturity government bonds, according to  Bevan Rosenbloom , an\nanalyst with RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut.  Operations in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru accounted for\n44 percent of Arcor\u2019s revenue last year, according to Fitch\nRatings. The overseas businesses improve investor confidence in\nArcor\u2019s ability to access dollars and repay debt, said  Cecilia Minguillon , a Fitch analyst in Buenos Aires. Argentina, which is\nrated six levels below investment grade by Moody\u2019s Investors\nService at B3, limits companies\u2019 access to dollars.  \u201cPeru, Chile and Brazil are investment-grade countries\nthat don\u2019t have such high exchange-control risks,\u201d Minguillon\nsaid. \u201cForeign exchange controls make it harder for companies\nto buy dollars.\u201d  Arcor may lure investors to its first overseas offering as\nthe yield estimate is more than 211 basis points, or 2.11\npercentage points, above the  average  5.89 percent yield on\ndollar bonds sold by emerging-market industrial companies,\naccording to JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s CEMBI index.  Fitch assigned a B+ grade to Arcor, one step above the\nArgentine government, saying in an Oct. 18 report that Arcor\u2019s\nexports to 120 countries and its international operations\n\u201cmitigate\u201d the risks of currency controls.  Scrapped Sale  Arcor, based in Arroyito, plans to use proceeds from the\nbond sale to refinance short-term debt, said a company official\nwho spoke on the condition he not be named in accordance with\ncorporate policy. Arcor scrapped plans to sell its first\noverseas bonds in 2007 because yields were too high, he said.  Argentine companies and provinces are stepping up sales in\ninternational markets after President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  restructured defaulted debt in June and record-low\ninterest rates in the U.S. and Europe sparked demand for higher-\nyielding assets. Argentine government dollar bonds, the\nbenchmark for the country\u2019s issuers,  yield  an average 607 basis\npoints over U.S. Treasuries.  Edenor, based in Buenos Aires, sold $140 million of bonds\ndue in 2022 to yield 9.75 percent last week, while Cordoba paid\n12.375 percent on $196 million of bonds that mature in 2017.  Investors accustomed to the high yields on Argentine debt\nmay balk at Arcor\u2019s terms, said  Ruth Mazzoni , a corporate bond\nanalyst at Standard Bank New York.  \u2018Juice\u2019  \u201cAnybody that\u2019s a regular buyer of Argentine debt will\nstruggle with the pricing because it strips out the juice,\u201d\nMazzoni said. Arcor may seek a yield as low as 7.25 percent, she\nsaid.  The yield on Argentina\u2019s 8.75 percent bonds due in 2017\ndeclined 1 basis point to 8.7 percent at 10:02 a.m. New York\ntime, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds, issued\nas part of the government\u2019s restructuring of $12.2 billion in\ndefaulted debt, yielded as much as 12.99 percent June 8.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine dollar\nbonds instead of U.S. Treasuries was unchanged today at 603\nbasis points and is down from 846 on July 1, according to\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.  Warrants linked to growth in South America\u2019s second-biggest\neconomy dropped 0.03 cent to 12.35 cents, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Default Swaps  The  cost  of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment\nfor five years with credit-default swaps fell 1 basis point\nyesterday to 747, according to data provider CMA. Credit-default\nswaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying\nsecurities or the cash equivalent should a government or company\nfail to adhere to debt agreements.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent today to 3.9612 per U.S.\ndollar.  Government regulations put in place in 2005 require\ninternational investors to deposit 30 percent of the funds they\nbring into Argentina with the central bank for a year. The move\nprompted MSCI Inc. to remove Argentina from its benchmark\nemerging-market index in June 2009, assigning it frontier status\nalong with the world\u2019s least developed markets, including\nBulgaria and Kenya.  \u201cA lot of companies are realizing that the situation in\nArgentina isn\u2019t likely to change very dramatically and so the\nonly way to grow will be to diversify\u201d abroad, Mazzoni said.\n\u201cThe return on equity under the current framework in Argentina\nisn\u2019t there. It just doesn\u2019t stimulate investment.\u201d  Argentine companies and provinces sold $2.6 billion of\nbonds overseas this year, up from $465 million last year,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. Four companies issued\ndebt abroad last week, the most for the period since at least\n1999.  A successful Arcor sale \u201ccould create a window for small\nissuers,\u201d RBS\u2019s Rosenbloom said.
