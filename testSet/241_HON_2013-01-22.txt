 "context": "The following article called 'Honeywell, Dupont Lose Challenge to Cap-and-Trade Program' was published on 2013-01-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHoneywell International Inc. (HON)  and\n DuPont Co. (DD)  lost a challenge to a U.S. cap-and-trade emissions\nprogram as a federal appeals court said it already ruled the\ncredit-transfers at issue in the case were lawful.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington today dismissed the\ncompanies\u2019 complaint that improper transfers by Honeywell\u2019s\ncompetitors in 2008 under an Environmental Protection Agency\nprogram for hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFC, reduced the\ncompany\u2019s market share. The court said an earlier case, Arkema\nInc. v. EPA, found the transfers valid under the Clean Air Act.  \u201cPut simply, Honeywell\u2019s claim is foreclosed by this\ncourt\u2019s decision in Arkema,\u201d U.S. Circuit Judge  Brett Kavanaugh \nwrote for the three-judge panel.  The dispute stems from regulatory efforts to phase out all\nuse of the pollutant by 2030. The agency caps the production and\nconsumption of HCFC on an annual basis and sets allowances for\neach company and each pollutant in the program. Under the Clean\nAir Act, the companies are allowed to transfer or swap their\nallowances.  The appeals court ruled three years ago that the EPA had to\nhonor transactions made by Arkema and  Solvay SA (SOLB)  that had been\noverlooked by the agency when setting their allowances for 2010\nthrough 2014.  \u201cThe company is disappointed with the court\u2019s decision and\nis currently studying the decision,\u201d Peter Dalpe, a spokesman\nfor Morris Township, New Jersey-based Honeywell, said in an e-\nmail.  Catherine Andriadis, a spokeswoman for Wilmington,\nDelaware-based DuPont, said she couldn\u2019t immediately comment on\nthe ruling.  The case is Honeywell International Inc. v. Environmental\nProtection Agency, 10-1347,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the\nDistrict of Columbia (Washington).
