The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVente-Privee.com , the European\nonline retailer that runs a U.S. site with  American Express Co. (AXP) ,\nsaid the proliferation of fashion outlets across America is\nchallenging the company\u2019s growth.  Vente-Privee, which plies discounted high-end fashion, wine\nand Iggy Pop albums to its 17 million European members, began\noperating in the U.S. a year ago and is finding it difficult\ncompeting with discounted brands at outlets as well as the\nimmediacy in which Americans expect delivery.  \u201cThe market is not very easy because almost all the brands\nproduce inventories for the outlets,\u201d Vente-Privee founder\nJacques-Antoine Granjon said in an interview today in  London .\n\u201cI don\u2019t wear Ralph Lauren because I know you can buy  Ralph\nLauren  for $10 at any outlet.\u201d  Vente-Privee\u2019s average two-to-three week delivery times are\nalso longer than U.S. customers expect because the Paris-based\ncompany doesn\u2019t have inventory, Granjon said.  While Granjon is banking on the American pastime of\nshopping to boost revenue and fuel expansion, business has been\nsomewhat hampered because fashion and goods are often on sale\nthere, compared with  Europe  where retailers are typically only\nallowed to sell at discounts a few times a year. It\u2019s also a\ncrowded market, Granjon said, with competition from companies\nlike Gilt Groupe Inc. and Rue La La as well as Amazon.com Inc.  \u2018Takes Time\u2019  \u201cThis kind of story takes time and we have to focus more\non real success which is the relationship with brands and\noffering brands that may not be at the outlets,\u201d the long-\nhaired, jeans-wearing founder said, adding there were no plans\nto quit the U.S. market.  The U.S site had sales of $20 million to $25 million in its\nfirst year, he said.  For now, Vente-Privee, which gets 80 percent of its\nbusiness from  France  and is projecting 1.3 billion euros ($1.7\nbillion) in revenue for 2012, is focusing on Europe. It\u2019s\npresent in eight European countries and Granjon said he\u2019s\nconcentrating on sales in Italy, Spain, Germany and the U.K.  The company is 20 percent owned by Summit Partners and\nthere are no plans to take it public or seek acquisitions,\nGranjon said. Top brands sold on the site include Disney,\nCamper, Desigual, Diesel and Triumph.  Granjon\u2019s also focusing more on the  music industry  and has\nplans to start selling more CDs, concert tickets and even\nsponsoring tours. He also wants to premiere more albums on his\nsite, like the album launch he did in May with Iggy Pop. Iggy\nsold 20,000 records through the site, Granjon said.  \u201cMusic is emotional and we started music because it fed\nour brand and it\u2019s about a culture,\u201d he said.
