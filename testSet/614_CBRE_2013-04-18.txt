 "context": "The following article called 'City Centers in U.S. Gain Share of Jobs as Suburbs Lose' was published on 2013-04-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe deepest downturn since the Great Depression has interrupted a decades-long trend of jobs steadily moving to the suburbs and hollowing out urban business districts across the U.S., a study finds.  City centers gained a greater share of employment than their outer rings between 2007 and 2010, according to a report today from the  Brookings Institution . It\u2019s not all good news -- big suburban job losses, not large downtown gains -- drove the shift and metropolitan economies are more decentralized than they were in 2000.  What\u2019s heartening is that the shift slowed during the downturn, said Elizabeth Kneebone, author of the report and a fellow at the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program in Washington. The report follows up on a 2009 study that found a continuous migration of jobs from downtown to the suburbs between 1998 and 2006.  \u201cThe recession stalled the trend but didn\u2019t reverse it,\u201d Kneebone said. \u201cAbsent policy changes as the economy starts to gain steam and regions are growing again, there\u2019s every reason to believe that trend will continue.\u201d  Urban revitalization and the notion of smart growth, which seeks to cluster housing and jobs near transit and entertainment, has had only limited success restoring downtowns.

Putting jobs near housing and rail, and vice versa, reduces commuting times, cuts household expenses and lowers government costs, she said.  When Courtney Klein Johnson, 29, and her partner opened their new business incubator near downtown Phoenix last February, she leased space in a once-bankrupt building near a commuter rail line even though she was living 90 minutes away and it would have been easier to find an office near her house.  \u201cYoung companies are moving here -- it was important for us to be right in the heart of that activity,\u201d said Klein Johnson, co-founder of  Seed Spot , which helps entrepreneurs start ventures that improve their communities. \u201cThe entrepreneurial vibe necessitates density -- density of ideas, people, culture. We have seven law firms and three banks surrounding our building. It\u2019s an accessible place for these startups to get connected.\u201d  Silicon Valley  It\u2019s not just where to put the jobs, it\u2019s where to put the workers. A coalition of San Francisco Bay-area governments wants to add transit and housing to Silicon Valley\u2019s sprawling office parks to create mini urban centers. Washington, D.C., once a void of boxy office buildings that emptied out at night to surrounding suburbs, is experiencing a revival, adding 1,100 new residents a month, according to  Harriet Tregoning , director of the city\u2019s office of planning.  Construction, manufacturing and retail were among industries hardest hit by the housing downturn and subsequent recession and helped stall the jobs sprawl. The industries accounted for almost 60 percent of job losses between 2007 and 2010, Kneebone said. Half those losses occurred 10 miles or more from a downtown.  Banding Together  Chicago \u2019s Southland, once a thriving industrial center, had already been hammered by a manufacturing decline in the 1980s and 1990s when it was hit by the  housing collapse  and recession. Now, 42 municipal governments in the region have banded together to use federal housing, environmental and economic development grants to convince manufacturers a city location makes economic sense.  \u201cIn some ways the ideas that we should\u2019ve been doing all along become relevant during tough times,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cThe core concepts are perhaps not new, but there\u2019s an urgency. We can\u2019t make unwise decisions because resources are so limited.\u201d  The San Francisco Bay area has relied on office-park sprawl to accommodate its growing technology community. Now area leaders are trying to draw some of those companies to downtown San Jose, San Francisco and Oakland. Two years ago, Twitter Inc. said it would expand its workforce in downtown San Francisco, signing a lease in central Market Square after the city exempted it from a local payroll tax.  Technology Jobs  Since then, technology jobs in the city have surged 50 percent to 42,326, while the number of tech companies has jumped 20 percent to 1,826, according to state data through the second quarter of 2012 analyzed by Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at brokerage CBRE Group Inc. in San Francisco.  \u201cCan we say it\u2019s a full-blown reversal? We\u2019ll have to wait and see,\u201d said Miriam Chion, director of planning and research at the Association of Bay Area Governments in Oakland. \u201cThe recession gave us a pause to collect our thoughts and look with calm perspective at what the trends were and where we could take advantage of more sustainable development in environmental terms but also in economic and social terms.\u201d  Since the end of 2010, offices in central business districts have recovered faster than their suburban counterparts, with vacancies falling to 14 percent at the end of 2012, when suburban vacancies were 18.8 percent, according to data firm  Reis Inc . in New York.  Bigger Share  Between 2007 and 2010, the central business districts of 54 of the nation\u2019s 100 largest metro areas gained a bigger share of employment, Brookings found, led by Chattanooga,  Tennessee , Louisville,  Kentucky , and New Orleans. Only four regions had absolute downtown job gains: New Orleans, Cincinnati, Charleston, South Carolina, and Austin,  Texas .  Related:   Top 12 American Boomtowns Areas experiencing the greatest increases in jobs sprawl during that time period were Cape Coral,  Florida , Little Rock,  Arkansas , and San Antonio.  In the Phoenix area, Klein Johnson is going against the grain. Between 2007 and 2010, that city\u2019s jobs sprawl actually worsened, with the share of jobs near the central business district falling to 18.1 percent from 18.8 percent, Brookings found. At the same time, employment in the outer ring grew to 46 percent from 44.5 percent of the region\u2019s total.  Two weeks ago, Klein Johnson bucked the Phoenix trend a second time when she and her husband gave up their yard and suburban cul-de-sac for a home about a mile from the office.  While she enjoys the \u201cbuzz\u201d of downtown, what\u2019s important for the 56 startups and their 75 workers are the business opportunities near the location her non-profit offers.  \u201cThink about where those employees spend their money,\u201d Klein Johnson said. \u201cThey\u2019re spending it where they live. The more proximity you can get around office and home and life, the more those taxpayer dollars and their spending power stays in their city.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Lorraine Woellert in  Washington  at  lwoellert@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Christopher Wellisz at  cwellisz@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CBRE Group Inc was 23.700000762939453 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CBRE Group Inc was ",
