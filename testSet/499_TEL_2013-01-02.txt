 "context": "The following article called 'SM Investments Surpasses PLDT as Biggest Philippine Stock' was published on 2013-01-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSM Investments Corp. (SM)  leapfrogged\n Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (TEL)  to become the nation\u2019s\nmost valuable stock, as Southeast Asia\u2019s fastest economic growth\nprompted a shift in consumer spending to property and leisure.  SM Investments, the holding company of the country\u2019s\nrichest man  Henry Sy , rose 0.2 percent on Dec. 28, boosting its\nmarket capitalization to 549.5 billion pesos ($13.4 billion),\n compared  with a value of 546.6 billion pesos for Philippine Long\nDistance, or PLDT. The Philippine stock market was shut on Dec.\n31 and Jan. 1 for holidays.  \u201cThis change isn\u2019t a fluke,\u201d Alex Pomento, strategist at\nMacquarie Group Ltd.\u2019s Manila unit, said in a phone interview.\n\u201cThis is an inevitable change of the guards and it is a\nreflection of the nation\u2019s consumer spending pattern.\u201d  Shares of SM Investments rallied 51 percent last year,\noutpacing the  Philippine Stock Exchange Index\u2019s (PCOMP)  33 percent gain,\nas the fastest economic expansion since 2010 boosted profits at\nthe company\u2019s retail, property and banking ventures. PLDT, the\nnation\u2019s largest phone company, trailed with a 0.5 percent drop\nas rising competition and a shift from calls and  text messages \nto social media offered by Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc.\nsqueezed earnings.  Manila-based SM Investments closed 2 percent higher at 900\npesos today, while PLDT gained 1.2 percent to 2,560 pesos. The\nbenchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index added 0.8 percent.  SM Investments owns the nation\u2019s biggest grocery and\ndepartment store operators. It also controls  BDO Unibank Inc. (BDO) ,\nthe biggest bank by assets, and  SM Prime Holdings Inc. (SMPH) , which\nruns 51 shopping mall centers in the  Philippines  and  China . It\nalso holds stakes in companies that are building a Manila-casino\nresort with Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd.  Consumer Confidence  SM\u2019s milestone is \u201cindicative of the growing confidence in\nthe nation\u2019s consumer market,\u201d said Rico Gomez, who helps\nmanage $2.2 billion at Manila-based Rizal Commercial Banking\nCorp. \u201cBoth companies rely on consumer spending but PLDT is in\na struggling sector while SM is in industries that are viewed\nvery positively at the moment.\u201d  The $225 billion Philippine economy  expanded  7.1 percent in\nthe third quarter of last year, the fastest pace in  Southeast\nAsia . The nation\u2019s central bank has cut its benchmark rate four\ntimes in 2012, falling to a record low 3.5 percent in October,\nto boost growth and has said it has room for more reductions.  The economy may grow as much 7 percent in 2012 and\naccelerate to 7.5 percent in 2014 as the government increases\nspending to a record and lures investments to upgrade the\nnation\u2019s infrastructure, Economic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said on Dec. 18.  Record Remittances  Consumer spending, which accounts for three-fourths of the\nPhilippine economy, is getting a boost from record remittances\nsent home by Filipinos living and working overseas. For every\npeso Filipinos spent in the third quarter, about 4.8 centavos\nwent to communications while 50.9 centavos went to food, drinks,\nclothes and home appliances, according to data compiled by the\ngovernment.  Communications as a percentage of total  consumer spending \nwas 4.8 percent in the third quarter, down from 5.3 percent in\n2010. The share of spending on food, drinks, clothes and\nappliances, leisure, restaurants and hotels increased to 58\npercent from 57 percent over the same period.  Nine-month  profit  at SM Investments rose 14 percent to 16.1\nbillion pesos from a year ago, the company said in a statement\non Nov. 8. PLDT\u2019s net income slid 6 percent to 28.7 billion\npesos as rising competition triggered price cuts and customers\npreferred communicating over the Internet instead of sending\nmobile text messages.  Profit Growth  PLDT\u2019s revenue from short-messaging services, or SMS, fell\n2 percent to 32.5 billion pesos in the first nine months of\n2012, it said in a statement on Nov. 6. Revenue from voice calls\ndeclined 7 percent as volumes dropped. Wireless broadband sales\nrose 3 percent, it said.  SM Investments may beat its annual  profit growth  target of\nas much as 14 percent in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Jose Sio\nsaid on Nov. 9. The company\u2019s profit is forecast to rise 15\npercent in 2013, according to seven analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg. PLDT\u2019s net income is expected to rise 4.9 percent,\naccording to a Bloomberg poll of 14 analysts.  \u201cSM Investments is in a growth path while earnings at PLDT\nhas stagnated due to competition and investments it had to make\nfor future growth,\u201d Pomento said. Macquarie has an outperform\nrating on SM Investments and a neutral call on PLDT.  Sio didn\u2019t respond to text messages sent to his mobile\nphone for a comment. Philippine Long Distance Chairman  Manuel Pangilinan  couldn\u2019t be reached in his office for a comment\nbecause of the holidays.  More Kick  SM Investments closed at 882 pesos on Dec. 28, 4.5 percent\nhigher than the average 12-month share price estimate of 844\npesos forecast by nine analysts in a survey by Bloomberg. PLDT\nclosed at 2,530 pesos, 9.4 percent lower than the 2,793 pesos\naverage target price of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Profit at PLDT, jointly owned by  Hong Kong \u2019s First Pacific\nCo. and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., tumbled 21 percent\nin 2011 after reaching a peak of 40.2 billion pesos in 2010.  PLDT will need more time to reach its 42 billion peso\nprofit forecast for 2014,  Chris Young , chief financial adviser,\ntold analysts in a Nov. 7 conference call.  \u201cSM Investments has a broader Philippine exposure,\u201d\nPomento said. \u201cIt\u2019s investments in mining and gaming, both\nrising industries, also provide SM Investments with more kick.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nIan Sayson in Manila at \n isayson@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDarren Boey at \n dboey@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of TE Connectivity was 31.124263763427734 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of TE Connectivity was ",
