 "context": "The following article called 'Zimbabwe Mining Companies Reject State Control, Document' was published on 2013-05-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Chamber of Mines of  Zimbabwe ,\nwhich represents companies including  Impala Platinum Holdings\nLtd. (IMP) , rejected a proposal for the state to control mineral\nproduction and prices, a draft response from the industry\norganization obtained by  Bloomberg News  shows.  Earlier this month, the country\u2019s Ministry of Mines\nproposed the auctioning of mineral deposits, restricting\nproduction of commodities deemed strategic and that the state\nsell the output from all mines. The ministry is seeking comment\nfrom mining companies before taking the proposed policy to\nparliament to have it passed into law. Zimbabwe has the world\u2019s\nsecond-biggest platinum and chrome reserves.  The proposal is \u201cgritty and confrontational,\u201d the Chamber\nsaid in a draft copy of its response, which may be given to the\ngovernment later this month. \u201cIdeologically the policy seems to\nbe at variance with the market-based national policy that the\ncountry has adopted.\u201d  Companies such as Impala and Rio Tinto Group are currently\nfree to sell their own minerals. The policy proposals come after\nImpala and  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  agreed to comply with an\nexisting law to cede 51 percent stakes in their local assets to\nblack Zimbabweans or the government.  \u201cWe will contribute effectively to the on going\ndevelopment of a new mining policy,\u201d Alex Mhembere, Chamber of\nMines president, told the body\u2019s Annual General Meeting, held\nlast week at the fly-fishing resort of Troutbeck in northeastern\nZimbabwe. \u201cWe do not regard our role as opposition to\ngovernment but partners seeking the same national goal and\naspiration.\u201d  No Trust  The chamber is due to meet the government on May 22 and\nagain on May 29.  In addition to platinum and chrome Zimbabwe has deposits of\ncoal, gold, copper, diamonds and  iron ore .   Aquarius Platinum\nLtd. (AQP)  also operates in the country.  Impala fell 1.4 percent to 96.59 rand in Johannesburg as of\n9:21 a.m local time. Amplats fell 0.8 percent to 286.96 rand\nwhile Aquarius rose 2.2 percent to 6.15 rand.  If implemented, the marketing policy will be a reversal of\nan earlier liberalization of mineral sales, which formerly had\nbeen undertaken by the Minerals Marketing Corp. of Zimbabwe and,\nin the case of gold, a unit of the central bank. Under the\nproposal, gold and platinum group metals will be sold by a\ndealer authorized by the Ministry of Finance and all other\nminerals will be sold by the MMCZ.  \u2018Socialist Thinking\u2019  \u201cThis policy on minerals marketing is premised on the\nnotion that the private sector cannot be trusted,\u201d the Chamber\nof Mines said.  \u201cThe world over producers have the right to\nmarket their own minerals based on an approved marketing\ncontract.\u201d  In addition to the changes to the marketing of minerals the\nministry proposed auctions of deposits as well as imposing new\ntaxes, the policy showed. It suggested a resource rent tax,\ndefined as a tax on profits in excess of an average national\nreturn on investment, and the regulation of mineral prices.  \u201cHaving gone through the lost decade, where the country\nhad a fatal flirtation with price controls, this should be\navoided at all costs,\u201d the Chamber said.  Zimbabwe\u2019s economy entered a recession around 2000 after a\ndisputed election and the imposition of a land reform policy\nthat involved the seizure of white-owned commercial farms. Over\nthe next decade the government controlled prices and imports.\nInflation rose to 500 billion percent, according to the\n International Monetary Fund , and the economy contracted by 40\npercent between 2000 and 2007.  Close Country  The country exited recession in 2009 and ended a political\nstalemate after President  Robert Mugabe \u2019s Zimbabwe African\nNational Union - Patriotic Front formed a coalition government\nwith the Movement For Democratic Change following the\nintervention of the 15-nation  Southern African Development\nCommunity .  The proposals \u201cwill effectively close the country to\nprivate exploration,\u201d the Chamber said. The government document\n\u201cis based on socialist thinking, where the state has a strong\nhand over the affairs of mineral extraction. Zimbabwe has\nlargely been a market-based economy.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nGodfrey Marawanyika in Johannesburg at \n gmarawanyika@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAntony Sguazzin at \n asguazzin@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of American Shared Hospital Services was 2.069999933242798 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of American Shared Hospital Services was ",
