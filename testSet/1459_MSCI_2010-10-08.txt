 "context": "The following article called 'Technology Replaces Banks as Better Dividend Bet for Investors' was published on 2010-10-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInvestors in the U.S. who used to\nrely on financial stocks for dividends can turn to an unlikely\nsuccessor: information technology.  Companies in the IT industry eclipsed financials in total\ndividend payouts for the first time in the third quarter. That\nmarks a change as IT companies generally have held onto cash so\nthey could reinvest it in research and development or make\nacquisitions. Now, facing pressure from yield-starved\nshareholders, firms such as Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft\nCorp. are choosing to disburse some of that cash by introducing\nor increasing dividends.  \u201cTech has excess cash and the ability to pay, whereas\nfinancials will take a long time to get back to where they\nwere,\u201d said  Howard Silverblatt , a senior index analyst at\nStandard & Poor\u2019s in New York.  IT stocks accounted for 9.2 percent of the almost $210\nbillion in  dividends  paid out as of Oct. 7 compared with 8.9\npercent for financial stocks, according to data compiled by S&P.\nIn 2007 before the recession, financial stocks made up 30\npercent of dividends and IT was 5.7 percent.  Companies in the IT sector are also maturing, which means\n cash flow  has risen and capital needs have fallen, said James\nMeyer, chief investment officer of investment management firm\nTower Bridge Advisors in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, whose\ntypical clients have $1 million or more in investable assets.  As of Oct. 6, 73 stocks in the  S&P 500 Index  paid dividends\nexceeding the average corporate bond yield of 3.6 percent, more\nthan at any time in at least 15 years, data compiled by\nBloomberg and Bank of America Corp. show. The average yield for\na stock in the IT industry that pays dividends is 1.9 percent\ncompared with 1.4 percent for a financial stock, based on data\nfrom S&P.  Reduced Payouts  Many financial companies reduced or eliminated their\npayouts because they accepted funds from the Troubled Asset\nRelief Program and are concerned about meeting certain capital\nrequirements before paying them again, said  Jeff Rubin , director\nof research at Westport, Connecticut-based Birinyi Associates, a\nmoney management and research firm.  Low fixed-income rates are also fueling the hunt for higher\nyields. The  two-year  Treasury note yield fell to a record low of\n0.3512 percent yesterday. The  10-year  security\u2019s yield dropped\nto 2.3552 percent on Oct. 6, the lowest level since January\n2009.  Clients are seeking dividend-paying stocks of high quality\nbecause they want income and companies \u201cthat they can go to\nsleep with at night,\u201d said  Hank Smith , chief investment officer\nof Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Haverford Trust Co., which manages\nabout $6 billion.  Haverford\u2019s Quality Growth Portfolio , which\nhas about $3 billion invested in dividend-paying companies,\nallocates 21 percent to technology stocks and 13 percent to\nfinancials.  Telecommunications Yields  Although more IT stocks are paying dividends, investors\nshould remember they still pay less than other industries, Rubin\nof Birinyi Associates said. Telecommunications and  utilities \noffer the highest yields of 6.1 percent and 4.5 percent,\nrespectively. And banks may start paying higher dividends again\nas soon as 2011, he said.  Helen Modly , a fee-only financial planner at Focus Wealth\nManagement in Middleburg, Virginia, said she\u2019s adding dividend\nexchange-traded funds to portfolios for the first time because\nof clients\u2019 requests for yield. She said she prefers  SPDR S&P\nDividend ETF , which has returned 13 percent this year, and\n Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF , which has returned 7.2\npercent, because they\u2019re less risky than owning individual\nstocks.  The SPDR S&P  fund , which yields 3.3 percent, has attracted\n$1.36 billion in net new inflows during the first eight months\nof the year, said  Jim Ross , global head of ETFs at State Street\nGlobal Advisors in Boston. The greatest allocation in the fund\nis to utilities, at 21 percent.  Tax Implications  In one of Vanguard Group Inc.\u2019s actively managed dividend\nfunds, the  Equity Income Fund , IT has increased to 8 percent\nfrom 2 percent of assets, said  Linda Wolohan , a spokeswoman for\nthe Valley Forge, Pennsylvania-based mutual fund company.  Last week Fidelity Investments changed the benchmark for\nits  Strategic Dividend and Income Fund  to the MSCI USA High\nDividend Yield Index from the Russell 3000 Value Index to\nincrease yield, said  Chris Sharpe , co-portfolio manager of the\nfund, who\u2019s based in Boston.  The move resulted in holdings in the financial industry\ndropping and IT increasing. As of June 30, the MSCI Index had\n3.5 percent in financials compared with 30 percent in the\n Russell Index  and IT had 5.8 percent compared with 5 percent in\nthe Russell Index, according to Fidelity.  For investors who opt to put money in dividend-paying\nstocks, there are tax implications to consider. Many dividends\nhave been taxed at a federal rate of 15 percent since 2003. Next\nyear, if Congress doesn\u2019t act, they may be taxed as ordinary\nincome, as high as 39.6 percent.
