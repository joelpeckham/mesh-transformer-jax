 "context": "The following article called 'CME Group Net Income Drops, Says CEO Switch Accelerates' was published on 2012-04-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCME Group Inc. (CME) , the world\u2019s largest\nfutures market, reported a 42 percent drop in profit from a year\nearlier and said its new chief executive officer could take over\nformal duties next month.  Net income fell to $266.6 million, or $4.02 a share, from\n$456.6 million, or $6.81 a share, a year earlier, Chicago-based\nCME said today in a statement. The year-ago earnings included a\n$164.4 million tax adjustment. The first-quarter per-share\nprofit beat the average estimate of $4 per share in a Bloomberg\nsurvey of analysts. Daily futures and options volume in the\nquarter dropped 11 percent to average 12.3 million contracts,\nthe company said earlier this month.  Trading slowed in the first quarter across all financial\nasset classes as European banks sought less risk,  hedge funds \nscaled back their investments, and  interest rates  held near\nzero, Jillian Miller, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets Corp.,\nwrote in an April 12 note to clients. Futures contracts at CME\nGroup tied to equity indexes and interest rates, two of its\nlargest product groups, fell 18 percent and 13 percent,\nrespectively, during the quarter, CME said April 3.  \u2018We See Risk\u2019  \u201cWe believe the stock could under-perform today as we see\nrisk to near-term and forward estimates,\u201d  Niamh Alexander , an\nanalyst at KBW Inc., wrote in a report after the earnings were\nreleased. The exchange\u2019s average daily volume in the current\nquarter of 10.6 million contracts is down 15 percent from the\nsame period a year ago, she said. \u201cThough April is typically\nthe weakest month of the quarter with potential for higher\nvolume as the quarter progresses, we still see downside risk\u201d\nto earnings estimates of $4.41 a share, she said.  CME Group  shares  rose 0.3 percent to $274 in New York. The\ncompany has fallen 11.8 percent over the past year.  Chief Executive Officer  Craig Donohue , 50, said today that\nthe transition to promote President Phupinder Gill to chief\nexecutive is going faster than planned, with a formal hand-off\npossible by the May 23 annual shareholder meeting. Donohue, CEO\nfor the past eight years, announced last month his plan to\nretire in December when his contract expires.  \u201cThis is my last earnings call,\u201d Donohue said on a\nconference call with analysts and investors today to discuss the\ncompany\u2019s performance.  Revenue Declines  Revenue dropped 6.9 percent to $775 million last quarter,\nfrom $832 million a year ago, the company said.  \u201cCME\u2019s core trading markets have been struggling for the\npast few months given its exposure to financial products,\nparticularly rates,\u201d Miller said in the April 12 note. She said\nshe expected CME Group to earn $4.03 per share on an adjusted\nbasis.  The company\u2019s ClearPort service, which guarantees swap\ncontracts with its clearinghouse, reported an 11 percent\nincrease in volumes in the quarter. ClearPort generates the\nhighest fees per contract at CME Group.  The exchange earned about $2 million in revenue in the\nfirst quarter from guaranteeing interest-rate and credit-default\nswaps with its clearinghouse, said Jamie Parisi, CME Group\u2019s\nchief financial officer. The exchange charges $5 to $6 per\nmillion of notional value to clear rate swaps and between $7 to\n$8 per million for credit swaps, he said.
