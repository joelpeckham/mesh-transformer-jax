 "context": "The following article called 'Combs Hands Gains to Buffett by Raising Bets When Picks Slip' was published on 2012-01-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTodd Combs,  Warren Buffett \u2019s\napprentice stock picker at  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , posted gains\non his first equity bets at the company by buying when markets\nfell and increasing stakes in investments that declined.  Purchases of seven stocks by Combs in the nine months ended\nSept. 30 advanced almost 14 percent as of Dec. 31, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was\nlittle changed last year. Combs\u2019s results were propelled by a 51\npercent surge in holdings of  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the world\u2019s\nsecond-biggest payments network, and a 28 percent advance in an\ninvestment in retailer Dollar General Corp.  Combs followed the example set by Buffett, who invested in\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. at the depths of the 2008 credit crunch\nand advised shareholders in 1998 to \u201c rejoice  when markets\ndecline.\u201d The portfolio manager hired by Buffett in 2010 added\nshares of Intel Corp.,  CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS)  and Dollar General on\nAug. 8 last year as the  S&P 500  had its biggest decline of 2011.  \u201cThose are very Buffett-like tenets of  value investing :\nBuy when the markets are fearful,\u201d said  Tom Lewandowski , an\nanalyst with Edward Jones & Co. who has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating on\nBerkshire. \u201cSo I\u2019m not surprised to see that Todd was buying.\u201d\nAug. 8 was the first trading day after S&P downgraded the U.S.  Buffett, 81, has said he\u2019ll focus on managing Berkshire\u2019s\nlargest stockholdings and count on Combs and Ted Weschler, who\nwas hired to join the Omaha, Nebraska-based firm this year, to\ntake stakes of about $200 million.  Buying Stocks  Combs spent about $1.24 billion accumulating positions in\nseven companies in first three quarters of 2011, according to\nthe data from filings distributed by the National Association of\nInsurance Commissioners. The holdings of CVS, Intel,  Dollar\nGeneral (DG) , MasterCard,  Visa Inc. (V) ,  General Dynamics Corp. (GD)  and\nDirecTV were valued at about $1.41 billion at year-end.  \u201cI\u2019d give him an excellent grade,\u201d said  David Kass , a\nprofessor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School\nof Business. \u201cHe is very much demonstrating what you might\nexpect a value investor like Warren Buffett to do.\u201d  MasterCard was acquired by Combs at an average cost of\nabout $246.74 in January and April, according to data compiled\nby Bloomberg. MasterCard, based in Purchase,  New York , surged to\n $372.82  by year-end.  An initial stake in Dollar General was acquired through\nJune 27 at an average price of $33.39. Combs bought a second\nbatch of shares through Aug. 8 at $31.29, and a third through\nAug. 29 at $31.69. He paid an average of $32.07 for about 4.5\nmillion shares. Dollar General ended the year at $41.14.  Next Generation  Combs bought about 3.5 million shares of CVS, the largest\nU.S. provider of  prescription drugs , through Aug. 8 at a cost of\nabout $36.15 a share, the data show. He added 2.2 million shares\nless than a month later at an average of $34.05. The stock ended\nthe year at $40.78 in New York trading.  Combs is part of a second generation of Berkshire leaders\nwho will collectively assume the responsibilities that Buffett\nhas held through his four decades as chairman, chief executive\nofficer and head of investments. He joined Berkshire as\nBuffett\u2019s longtime backup stock picker, Lou Simpson, retired.\nCombs made the equity investments through Berkshire\u2019s Geico\nCorp., the car-insurance subsidiary whose portfolio previously\nwas overseen by Simpson.  Berkshire\u2019s biggest stock bet of 2011 was made by Buffett,\nwho wagered more than $10 billion on  International Business\nMachines Corp. (IBM)  Berkshire\u2019s top stake is a holding of Coca-Cola\nCo. valued at more than $13 billion. Combs was assigned to\noversee as much as $3 billion and can make trades without\nconsulting Buffett.  \u2018Bigger Things\u2019  \u201cAny time there\u2019s a $200 million purchase or something\nlike that, that\u2019s very likely to be Todd or Ted,\u201d Buffett said\nNov. 14 in a televised CNBC interview. \u201cThat\u2019s not me because I\nlook at bigger things.\u201d  Buffett didn\u2019t respond to an interview request e-mailed to\nhis assistant,  Carrie Kizer . Combs declined to comment.  Combs came to Berkshire from Castle Point Capital\nManagement LLC, where he oversaw shares of financial-services\ncompanies including MasterCard. The former hedge fund manager,\nwho was 39 when Buffett announced the hiring in October 2010,\nhas a bachelor\u2019s degree from  Florida State University . Combs\nalso has a master\u2019s in business administration from  Columbia\nUniversity , where Buffett studied.  Berkshire added four companies to the portfolio in the days\nthrough Aug. 8, spending about $125 million each on CVS,  Intel (INTC) ,\nGeneral Dynamics and DirecTV. Berkshire added about $75 million\nof shares in each company in purchases through late August or\nearly September.  \u2018A Great Time\u2019  \u201cIt was a great time for him to step in, in retrospect,\u201d\nsaid  Patrick Wang , an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. who has\nan \u201cequalweight\u201d rating on Intel shares. \u201cThere were a lot of\nquestions about whether stocks would work\u201d in early August.  DirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-TV provider, was one of\nWeschler\u2019s stock picks at his Charlottesville, Virginia-based,\nPeninsula Capital Advisors LLC. Berkshire said in September it\nwas hiring Weschler, a marathoner who also invested in W.R.\nGrace & Co. and made a gain trading Bank of America Corp.\nshares.  \u201cI found it fascinating that Todd Combs purchased\n DirecTV (DTV) ,\u201d said Kass. \u201cIt sort of implies that Todd Combs is in\nagreement with Ted Weschler\u201d on the stock, he said.  The purchase dates and prices, detailed in NAIC statements,\naren\u2019t included in quarterly filings to the Securities and\nExchange Commission. When stakes are built across multiple days,\nthe NAIC allows companies to consolidate acquisitions under the\ndate of the last purchase. The NAIC tracks securities held by\nregulated insurance companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAndrew Frye in New York at \n afrye@bloomberg.net .
