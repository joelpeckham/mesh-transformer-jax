 "context": "The following article called 'Real\u2019s Turnaround Seen Fleeting as Brazil Bewilders: Currencies' was published on 2013-10-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFor the world\u2019s biggest foreign-exchange trader, the Brazilian real\u2019s 11 percent rally from a 4\n1/2-year low is just another reason to sell one of the \u201cbad\napples\u201d of emerging-market currencies.  Deutsche Bank AG says a possible credit-rating downgrade\nand  Brazil \u2019s biggest current-account deficit in 11 years will\ncause the real to reverse recent gains. Speculators agree, with\nbearish bets on the currency doubling in a month on  Latin\nAmerica \u2019s main stock exchange to a record $20 billion this week.  \u201cIt\u2019s a good time to put the trade back on,\u201d Daniel Brehon, a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank in  New York , said\nin an Oct. 2 phone interview. \u201cBrazil is the most vulnerable in\nthe region.\u201d  While the real received a boost from the  Federal Reserve \u2019s\nsurprise Sept. 18 decision to maintain unprecedented monetary\nstimulus, it has still weakened versus 13 of the 16 most-traded\ncurrencies tracked by Bloomberg this year. That\u2019s confounding\nthe efforts of President  Dilma Rousseff  to soften its drop and\nbring down the highest  inflation expectations  in nine years\nthrough a $60 billion currency intervention program.  Alan Ruskin , Deutsche Bank\u2019s New York-based global head of\nGroup-of-10 foreign exchange, recommends using options to sell\nthe real against the dollar.  Biggest Advance  Along with the Turkish lira and Malaysian ringgit, Ruskin\nlabeled the currencies as \u201cbad apples\u201d in a Sept. 25 report,\nsaying rising global interest rates will damp growth in\ncountries that experienced  \u201cexuberant\u201d lending , which risks\nincreasing the current-account deficit. He said the eventual end\nof the Fed\u2019s monetary stimulus program will keep emerging-market\ncurrencies including the real \u201cunder pressure.\u201d  The real climbed to 2.2069 per dollar yesterday in New\nYork, from 2.4549 on Aug. 21, the weakest level since December\n2008. It gained the most of 16 major currencies in the past\nmonth, paring its decline this year to 7 percent, still on pace\nfor a third-straight annual loss.  For a decade through 2010, Brazil, Latin America\u2019s largest\neconomy, embodied the growing power of developing nations along\nwith  China , India and  Russia , together labeled the BRIC nations.\nGrowth started to sputter in 2011 as a slowdown in China reduced\ndemand for Brazilian commodities including iron ore and\nsoybeans, while Rousseff administration\u2019s increased meddling in\nthe economy sapped investors\u2019 confidence.  Current-Account Gap  The real has tumbled 25 percent since Rousseff, a 65-year-old former Marxist guerrilla, took office in January 2011. Now,\nfacing re-election in October 2014, her challenge is to persuade\ninvestors that Moody\u2019s Investors Service was wrong when it\nlowered its outlook on the nation\u2019s sovereign rating this week.  Morgan Stanley said the real may be hurt by a \u201cfurther\ndeterioration in external and fiscal accounts,\u201d as well as the\npotential for Brazil to reduce its currency intervention program\nto protect exporters, according to an Oct. 2 report by Rashique Rahman, the firm\u2019s head of emerging-market strategy in New York.  The  deficit  in Brazil\u2019s current account, the broadest\nmeasure of trade, jumped to 3.6 percent of gross domestic\nproduct in August, the most since 2002, Bloomberg data show. The\nshortfall leaves the country more dependent on foreign capital.  Money flowing out of Brazil as trade and investment totaled\n$335 million this year through Sept. 27, after the country\nattracted $16.8 billion in 2012 and $65 billion in 2011, central\nbank data show.  Outlook Cut  Moody\u2019s cut Brazil\u2019s Baa2 sovereign rating -- two levels\nabove junk status -- to \u201cstable\u201d from \u201cpositive\u201d on Oct. 2,\nciting the nation\u2019s deteriorating debt and investment ratios and\nevidence the economy is going through a period of slow growth.  Brazil\u2019s economy expanded less than forecast by analysts in\nfive of the past six quarters and the central bank trimmed its\n2013 growth outlook to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent this week.\nThat\u2019s down from 7.6 percent in 2010, and Moody\u2019s said it would\nconsider cutting the country\u2019s credit rating if it fell into a\n\u201clow growth trap\u201d of sub-3 percent expansions beyond 2014.  While annualized  inflation  cooled to a nine-month low of\n5.93 percent through mid-September, that may prove short-lived\nas a weaker  exchange rate  pushes up the cost of imports.  Consumer prices will increase 6.21 percent over the next 12\nmonths, matching the highest  expectations  since 2004, according\nto a central bank survey of economists on Sept. 27. Brazil\ntargets inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage\npoints.  Street Protests  Soaring inflation was one of the triggers that led more\nthan 1 million Brazilians to take to the streets in June in the\ncountry\u2019s biggest demonstrations in two decades. The same month,\n Standard & Poor\u2019s  put Brazil\u2019s BBB rating, equivalent to its\nMoody\u2019s grade, on \u201cnegative outlook,\u201d citing \u201cweaker\u201d fiscal\npolicy and a deterioration in the government\u2019s credibility.  \u201cWhen S&P did the move back in June, we already knew that\nit\u2019s only a matter of time that Moody\u2019s would take out that\npositive outlook,\u201d Kenneth Lam, a New York-based Latin America\nstrategist at Citigroup Inc., the second-biggest currency\ntrader, said in a phone interview yesterday. \u201cBrazil\u2019s\ndeteriorating economic matrix has been very well known and been\npriced in\u201d to the real, he said.  Citigroup in August forecast a level of 2.32 reais per\ndollar by year-end, which made it more pessimistic than the\nmedian estimate in a Bloomberg analyst survey, which sees\nBrazil\u2019s currency ending 2013 at 2.3 per dollar. In June, the\nmedian estimate was for a year-end level of 2 per dollar.  Futures Bets  The value of futures contracts betting that the real will\ndecline versus the dollar was $18.6 billion on Oct. 2, up from\n$10.9 billion at the end of August, based on data compiled by\nSao Paulo-based BM&FBovespa SA, Brazil\u2019s largest stock exchange.  As recently as June, foreign investors had more bets that\nthe real would appreciate than depreciate, according to BM&F.\nThat has shifted as concern grew that rising U.S. bond yields\nmay siphon capital away from Brazil.  The real\u2019s recovery has further to go as the central bank\nraises interest rates and the economy recovers, said Viktor Szabo, who helps oversee $10 billion of emerging-market assets\nas a portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc.  \u201cLocal rates are one of the most attractive in  emerging\nmarkets ,\u201d Szabo by phone from London Sept. 24.  At 11.73 percent, yields on Brazil\u2019s 10-year government\nbonds are the highest in the world after  Pakistan , according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 2.63 percent for\n U.S. Treasuries (USGG10YR) , up from 1.61 percent on May 1.  Investors Skeptical  Brazil\u2019s central bank has lifted the benchmark  interest\nrate  by 1.75 percentage points this year to 9 percent, making it\nmore attractive to hold local assets.  Even as Rousseff pledged to dial back public lending and\ncut spending twice this year, investors remain skeptical that\nshe will maintain fiscal discipline ahead of the election. The\ngovernment will miss its target of a  budget surplus  excluding\ninterest payments equal to 2.3 percent of GDP this year, which\nwas already lowered from 3.1 percent, Citigroup estimates.  With no sign of reforms that will improve productivity\nbefore the 2014 vote, the real will decline as rising local\ncosts erode Brazilian industry\u2019s competitiveness, according to\nMarcela Meirelles, a strategist at TCW Group Inc., which\noversees $128 billion.  \u201cAt the current level, your potential downside is larger\nthan the upside,\u201d Meirelles said in a phone interview from  Los\nAngeles  on Sept. 24. \u201cBrazil needs a weak currency to restore\nits competitiveness if nothing is done on the reform side.\u201d  Companies are among the losers of the weak real.  Gol Linhas\nAereas Inteligentes SA (GOL) , Brazil\u2019s second-largest air carrier by\nmarket value, is spending more on jet fuel than any other\nairline its size in the Americas as the real\u2019s decline boosts\nimported fuel costs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nSugar producer Grupo Virgolino de Oliveira SA\u2019s debt costs have\nrisen for the same reason, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Companies hedging these risks weigh further on the real,\nsaid Italo Lombardi, an economist at Standard Chartered Plc.  \u201cThe pressure is pretty high,\u201d he said in a Sept. 26\nphone interview from New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is over.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nYe Xie in New York at \n yxie6@bloomberg.net ;\nBlake Schmidt in  Sao Paulo  at \n bschmidt16@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Paul Armstrong  at \n parmstrong10@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. was 9.978241920471191 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes S.A. was ",
