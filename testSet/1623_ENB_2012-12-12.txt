 "context": "The following article called 'Heavy Alberta Oil Drops to Record Low as U.S. Supplies Increase' was published on 2012-12-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHeavy  Alberta  oil tumbled to a\nrecord low against the U.S. benchmark crude as supplies were\ndriven up by increased output, limited pipeline space and a\nMidwest refinery unit shutdown.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  processed the first oil at the Firebag 4\ncomplex, an in-situ steam-assisted gravity drainage operation\nthat was commissioned in the third quarter, about three months\nahead of schedule, the company said in a statement Dec. 6. The\nplant was producing about 130,000 barrels a day by the end of\nNovember, Suncor said.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said last month that shipments on segments of\ncrude-oil Lines 4 and 67 were apportioned for December in\naggregate by 13 percent.  BP Plc (BP/) \u2019s Whiting refinery in  Indiana \nshut Pipestill 12, the largest crude unit at the plant, for part\nof a project that\u2019s expected to be completed by the middle of\nnext year, a person familiar with the situation said Nov. 5.  Western Canada Select, a sour crude blended from\nconventional, heavy Canadian oils, dropped for the third\nstraight day, declining $3 to a discount of $37 a barrel against\nWest Texas Intermediate at 2:23 p.m.  New York  time, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show. That\u2019s the oil\u2019s weakest level since\nMay 2008, when Bloomberg began compiling pricing.  Syncrude Down  Syncrude, a synthetic oil upgraded from tar-like bitumen in\nAlberta into feedstock for refineries, slid $1 to 85 cents a\nbarrel above WTI, the lowest premium since Dec. 3.  In the U.S.  Gulf Coast , West Texas Sour gained 25 cents to\na $15.50-a-barrel discount to WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet\u2019s premium increased 30 cents a barrel\nto $23.75 above the benchmark, the highest level in more than\nthree weeks. Heavy Louisiana Sweet\u2019s premium rose 25 cents to\n$23 a barrel.  Poseidon\u2019s premium widened 40 cents to $18.50 a barrel\nversus WTI. Mars Blend increased 50 cents to $18.25 a barrel\nover WTI, and Southern Green Canyon gained 90 cents to a $19\npremium.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower\nsulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,\nslipped 40 cents to $19.40 a barrel above WTI.  The spread between WTI and European benchmark Brent crude\nwidened 51 cents to $22.73 a barrel based on settlement prices,\nthe biggest differential since Nov. 28. When Brent\u2019s premium to\nWTI gains, it typically strengthens the value of U.S. grades\nthat compete with oils priced using the European benchmark.  \u201cThe Brent-WTI spread widened today, and that impacts the\ncrude oils that are traded on the Gulf Coast,\u201d  Andy Lipow ,\npresident of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said by\ntelephone.
