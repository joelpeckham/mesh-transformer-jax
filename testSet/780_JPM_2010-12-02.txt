The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHedge funds will benefit and the\nbroader economy will suffer if new curbs on trading by U.S.\nbanks are left unchanged, according to the head of SkyBridge\nCapital LLC.  The Volcker rule, enacted this year to curtail proprietary\ntrading by U.S. banks, keeps rival traders out of his business,\nsaid  Anthony Scaramucci , managing partner of SkyBridge Capital\nLLC, who spoke today at the Bloomberg Hedge Funds 2010\n conference .  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co  and\nBank of America Corp. have cut jobs in proprietary trading or\nshifted traders into other units to comply with the law.

It\nwould be better for society,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re\ntaking speculators out of a market, you\u2019re widening spreads.\nWhen you widen spreads, you\u2019re increasing the costs of\ntransactions for normal citizens. When you increase the costs\nfor normal citizens, it hurts the society.\u201d  The Volcker rule, part of the financial industry overhaul\napproved by Congress in July, was designed to limit trading by\nbank holding companies for their own account.
