 "context": "The following article called 'Microsoft CEO Ballmer to Retire Within Next 12 Months' was published on 2013-08-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, who has struggled to adapt the world\u2019s largest software maker to the shift away from personal computers and toward mobile devices, will retire after more than a decade at the helm.  Ballmer, 57, plans to step down within 12 months, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said today in a statement. The company\u2019s lead independent director,  John Thompson , will oversee the search for his successor, heading a committee that will also include Microsoft co-founder  Bill Gates . Investors applauded the move, sending the shares up the most since 2009.  Ballmer\u2019s move reflects the changes roiling the computing industry his company helped pioneer. Microsoft, which supplies the software running most PCs, lost almost half its value on Ballmer\u2019s watch. The stock hasn\u2019t closed above $50 since his first year on the job amid competition from  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  in everything from tablets to the Web.  Related Features: \u201cThere is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,\u201d Ballmer wrote in a  memo  to employees today that was posted on Microsoft\u2019s website. \u201cWe need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.\u201d  Management Reorganization  The announcement comes six weeks after Ballmer streamlined the company\u2019s management, spurring speculation that he was grooming successors. He cut the number of business units to four and said Windows chief Julie Larson-Green, 51, would oversee all hardware, including the Surface tablet and Xbox console and related games. Windows Phone software head Terry Myerson gained responsibility for the Windows and Xbox operating systems. Skype president Tony Bates, 46, was put in charge of a new group for business development and acquisitions.  Other PC-related companies have also been struggling with the decline in their industry.  Intel Corp. (INTC) , which supplies the chips used in PCs, announced a CEO change last year.  Dell Inc. (DELL) , the No. 3 PC maker, is embroiled in a months-long battle to go private. And this week,  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , the No. 2 PC company, shook up its executive ranks as it attempts a turnaround.  The mantle of technology leadership has instead been taken up by Google, Apple and Facebook, which have over the past decade moved the landscape toward trends like mobile, search and social networking -- all areas where Microsoft is weak.  Challenged Business  Amid these shifts, Microsoft last month reported quarterly profit and sales that missed analysts\u2019 estimates. The company\u2019s latest computing operating system, Windows 8, also hasn\u2019t spurred the comeback that Ballmer was aiming for. In April, activist investor ValueAct Holdings LP disclosed a stake of about $1.9 billion in Microsoft, pushing the software maker to consider giving the shareholder a board seat.  \u201cHe\u2019s become a lightning rod for frustration over Microsoft\u2019s lack of progress in mobile and Windows 8,\u201d said  Richard Williams , an analyst at Cross Research in Millburn,  New Jersey .  The company\u2019s stock rose 7.3 percent to $34.75 at the close in  New York .  Ballmer had thought about retirement for quite a while and the timing became clearer over the last few months, he said in an  interview  with ZDNet. The CEO said he officially decided that he would exit during a board call two days ago. Gates, who is chairman and on the board, didn\u2019t ask Ballmer to stay, said the CEO.  Internal Shock  \u201cBill respects my decision,\u201d Ballmer said to ZDNet. \u201cUltimately, these kinds of things have to be one\u2019s own personal decision.\u201d  Members of Microsoft\u2019s senior leadership team only learned about Ballmer\u2019s decision to retire last night, said a person with knowledge of the matter. Many senior executives were surprised, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private.  Microsoft said it would consider both external and internal candidates for CEO. Among the internal candidates are Bates, Myerson, Satya Nadella, head of the server business who was appointed to direct cloud and enterprise products last month, and Qi Lu, responsible for the Bing search engine and other Internet projects and who was named to oversee Office and the Skype videoconference business and to run a new applications group, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to identified because the discussions are private.  Someone who isn\u2019t in the running is Gates, 57, who has been working on projects at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among other things, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Ballmer-Gates Relationship  Ballmer took over the CEO role in 2000 from Gates, his schoolmate at  Harvard University . While Ballmer had a boisterous style that made him legendary at company presentations, he largely remained in Gates\u2019s shadow. Ballmer wasn\u2019t seen as possessing the same vision for technology or the ability to anticipate changes in the industry, said Williams.  \u201cBallmer was more the executive than the visionary and he missed a few turning points that visionaries wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Williams said.  Unlike Gates, who dropped out of Harvard to start Microsoft, Ballmer stayed in school and received a degree in applied math and economics. He then joined Microsoft in 1980.  Gates and Ballmer had very different management styles. While Gates was Microsoft\u2019s geeky visionary, Ballmer was its excitable salesman. One video of the CEO on YouTube, entitled \u201cThe Best of  Steve Ballmer ,\u201d features clips of him yelping and jumping on stage, wide-eyed and sweating, singing Microsoft\u2019s virtues.  Microsoft\u2019s Rise  In the 1980s and 90s, Microsoft\u2019s swift rise to PC software dominance made Ballmer a billionaire many times over. He is the world\u2019s 44th richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a fortune of $16.8 billion. Gates, the richest person in the world, has a net worth of $72.4 billion.  \u201cThis is a time of important transformation for Microsoft,\u201d Ballmer wrote in the memo. \u201cThis is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take this step in the best interests of the company I love.\u201d  He said he plans to continue as one of the company\u2019s largest owners. Ballmer is the company\u2019s No. 5 shareholder, with a 4 percent stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  With Microsoft shares soaring today on the announcement of his coming retirement, Ballmer\u2019s net worth jumped about $786 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Big Shakeup  Last month\u2019s reorganization, Microsoft\u2019s largest shakeup in a decade, is designed to speed development of hardware and services as the company\u2019s Windows business suffers from the shrinking PC market and poor demand for Windows-based mobile devices. The shuffle reversed some changes Ballmer made in 2002, when he divided Microsoft into what was then seven individual product units, each led by an executive with operational and financial responsibilities.  In the decade since then, he mainly tinkered with individual businesses. In 2011, Bob Muglia was pushed out as server chief, and in 2006 Ballmer revamped leadership of the Windows and Internet units after development delays for the Windows Vista operating system.  The latest reorganization was seen by analysts as a signal of which executives may be poised to succeed Ballmer. Before taking charge of hardware, Larson-Green helped spearhead a radical redesign of Microsoft\u2019s flagship operating system to create Windows 8, which was released in October.  Windows 8  While the new software ushered in major technological advancements, it also aroused the ire of some longtime users. Still, Larson-Green has been a  rising star  at Microsoft. She joined the company in 1993 and became a vice president in the Office division in 2006.  As demand wanes for PCs, the July management shakeup sought to turn away from Microsoft\u2019s original focus on \u201cputting a PC on every desk in every home,\u201d Ballmer wrote in a memo at the time. PC shipments fell about 11 percent in the second quarter, for a record fifth straight quarter of declines, according to market research firms IDC and Gartner Inc.  \u2018Comprehensive Vision\u2019  \u201cBallmer did a very good job turning Microsoft from a bloated monstrosity into a much leaner and meaner machine over the last few years,\u201d said Microsoft investor  Michael Obuchowski , a portfolio manager at North Shore Asset Management LLC in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. \u201cHowever, despite the improved operations and much better quality of programming, Microsoft was severely lacking a comprehensive vision that would have allowed the company to stay ahead of the trends.\u201d  Microsoft also is trying to challenge  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and Google in cloud services as more customers opt for software that\u2019s run over the Web instead of installed on corporate machines. Cloud efforts that were scattered across several divisions were concentrated under two units in the reorganization.  Even with all the recent executive changes, there\u2019s no heir apparent, Obuchowski said.  \u201cThis is not going to be an easy search,\u201d he said. \u201cThe expectations are very high and I don\u2019t think Microsoft can afford to make a mistake here. I can\u2019t think of any obvious candidates off the top of my head.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story: Scott Moritz in New York at  smoritz6@bloomberg.net ; Sarah Frier in New York at  sfrier1@bloomberg.net ; Dina Bass in Seattle at  dbass2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: Pui-Wing Tam at  ptam13@bloomberg.net ; Nick Turner at  nturner7@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Intel Corporation was 17.682771682739258 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Intel Corporation was ",
