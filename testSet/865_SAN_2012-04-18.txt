The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSpain \u2019s surging  bad loans  are\nspurring doubt on whether the government can persuade investors\nthat it can clean up the country\u2019s banks without further\ndamaging public finances.  Non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending\njumped to 8.16 percent in February, the highest level since\n1994, from less than 1 percent in 2007, according to Bank of\nSpain data published today. The ratio rose from 7.91 percent in\nJanuary as 3.8 billion euros of loans soured in February, a 110\npercent increase from the same month a year ago. That takes the\ntotal credit in the economy that the regulator lists as\n\u201cdoubtful\u201d to 143.8 billion euros.  Defaults are rising and  credit  is shrinking at a record\npace as 24 percent unemployment corrodes the quality of loans\nbuilt up in the country\u2019s credit boom and saps the appetite of\nbanks to make new ones. Doubts about the extent of Spain\u2019s non-\nperforming loans problem is hurting bank stocks and driving up\nthe government\u2019s borrowing costs on investor concern that the\nexpense of propping up ailing lenders may add to the debt\nburden.  \u201cOne of our concerns in Spain is to what extent contingent\nliabilities could pass to the central government,\u201d said  Andrew Bosomworth , Pacific Investment Management Co.\u2019s Munich-based\nhead of  portfolio management . Non-performing loans \u201cwill have\nto rise when you take into account the  unemployment rate  and\nwhat\u2019s happening with the economy,\u201d he said.  \u2018Further Hole\u2019  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is battling to convince\ninvestors Spain\u2019s finances are under control after his refusal\nlast month to meet deficit targets set by the European\nCommission. By seeking to cut the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of\ngross domestic product from 8.5 percent over two years, he risks\ndriving bad loans as the deepest austerity measures in three\ndecades push the economy back into a recession.  \u201cA lot of our doubts are based on the grounds that non-\nperforming loans should increase,\u201d said Tobias Blattner, an\neconomist at Daiwa Capital Markets in London, adding that he\nexpects  house prices  still may fall by as much as 20 percent.\n\u201cThat could make a further hole in balance sheets of the\nbanks.\u201d  Bank shares extended declines today after the bad-loan\nfigures were released.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain\u2019s biggest\nlender, fell as much as 3 percent and CaixaBank SA, the fourth\nlargest, dropped as much as 3.3 percent.  Bonds Rise  Spanish bonds rose for a second day as the extra yield that\ninvestors demand to hold 10-year debt instead of German bunds\nnarrowed to 404.5 basis points from 413.7 basis points\nyesterday.  Rajoy\u2019s government announced plans in February to force\nbanks to take their share of costs of 50 billion euros ($65.6\nbillion) for building provisions and capital to make them\nrecognize losses on real estate piled up on their balance sheets\nduring the country\u2019s housing bust.  The Bank of Spain said late yesterday that lenders will\ntake a total of 53.8 billion euros to meet the new requirements,\nincluding 29.1 billion euros in provisions and 15.6 billion\neuros to create capital buffers. While most companies would be\nable to comply \u201cwithout major difficulty,\u201d the central bank\nwould  tighten its vigilance  over lenders that may struggle to\nmeet the requirements, it said.  Provisions  The plan implies a loss ratio for those assets of about 25\npercent based on the fact that banks have already made\nprovisions of 50 billion euros against total real estate risk of\n340 billion euros, said Daragh Quinn, an analyst at Nomura\nInternational in  Madrid .  Depending on how much the economy contracts and asset\nprices fall, further provisions of as much as 40 billion euros\nmay be needed, said Daiwa\u2019s Blattner.  \u201cIn light of the bleak profitability outlook for the\nSpanish banking sector, we are concerned whether banks will be\nable to put aside the provisions the government has requested,\u201d\nhe said.  So far the government\u2019s efforts to bolster confidence in\nthe banks has focused on making them recognize losses linked\nmainly to real estate.  Banco Espanol de Credito SA (BTO) , a Spanish\nconsumer bank  controlled  by Banco Santander SA, said April 12\nthat first-quarter profit fell 88 percent as it made provisions\nto cover about half of the 1 billion euros in real estate\ncharges the company must make this year to comply with the\ngovernment\u2019s order.  Other Loans  Still, Spain\u2019s deteriorating economy means other classes of\nloans apart from those linked to real estate are also at risk of\ngoing sour, Blattner said.  The Bank of Spain, which says banks are burdened with about\n176 billion euros of \u201ctroubled\u201d real estate assets, lists\nabout 21 percent of the 298 billion euros of loans linked to\nproperty developers as non-performing. The bad-loans ratio for\nindustry excluding construction has jumped to 5.4 percent from 1\npercent in 2007, according to the Bank of Spain.  \u201cThe 50 billion euros of extra capital looks like it\u2019s in\nthe ballpark,\u201d said Bosomworth, referring to the government\u2019s\ncleanup plan. Still, the \u201cbalance of risks\u201d suggests more\nfunds may be needed given what\u2019s happening in the economy, he\nsaid.  ECB Stability Facility  One option open to Spain should it need to recapitalize\nbanks further would be to take funds from the European Financial\nStability Facility, the euro-area\u2019s temporary bailout fund, said\nDaiwa\u2019s Blattner.  That would come with a \u201ccertain stigma attached\u201d because\nit may signal the government has lost  market access , he said.\nSpain can weather its troubles without a bailout and widening\nbond spreads are a \u201cwarning shot\u201d from investors,  Norbert Barthle , the parliamentary budget spokesman for German\nChancellor  Angela Merkel \u2019s Christian Democratic Party, said by\ntelephone yesterday.  Spain has managed to stop the cleanup of the banking system\nfrom hurting government finances by making the industry absorb\nthe cost by contributing more to the deposit guarantee fund. The\nfund has helped to finance the state\u2019s sale of failed lenders\nincluding Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo and Unnim by covering\nfuture losses for buyers.  Bankia Concerns  To be sure, investors have better information on the risks\nfacing Spanish banks as the industry has shrunk and the Bank of\nSpain has made them unveil their real estate exposure, said\nNomura\u2019s Quinn.  Bankia, a grouping of seven former savings banks with about\n300 billion euros in assets, has become a focus of analyst\nconcerns about Spain\u2019s banking system.  Deutsche Bank AG analyst Carlos Berastain said in an April\n11 he was downgrading Bankia to sell from hold because of its\n\u201cvery low\u201d profitability and the weak solvency position of its\nparent company. While Spanish banks face their \u201ctoughest year\nto date\u201d in terms of profitability, 2012 also may be the\n\u201cturning point\u201d toward earnings that are more normal in 2013\non reduced needs to make impairments, Berastain wrote.  \u201cEveryone, even the Eskimos, knows that bad loans in Spain\nare going up,\u201d said  Antonio Ramirez , a banking analyst at\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods in  London . \u201cThe sovereign is affected\nby the view in the markets that the banks are in difficulties\nand in a circular loop the banks are affected by the market view\nthat the sovereign is weak.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nCharles Penty in Madrid  at \n cpenty@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nFrank Connelly at \n fconnelly@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Banco Santander, S.A.
