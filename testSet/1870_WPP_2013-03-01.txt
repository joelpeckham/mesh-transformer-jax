Sterling dropped for the third time in four days versus the\neuro as the  Bank of England  said mortgage approvals declined in\nJanuary, signaling the housing market is struggling to recover.\nThe pound has dropped the most of any major currency this year\nas speculation the central bank will need to add more monetary\nsupport to the faltering economy damped demand. U.K. government\nbonds rose, with 10-year yields set for their biggest weekly\ndrop since November 2011.  \u201cThe data was supposed to be good and it came out negative\nso that has taken the rug out from under sterling\u2019s feet,\u201d said\nJane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank\nInternational in  London . \u201cThere is an array of negative\nfundamentals for the U.K., so it\u2019s very difficult to see silver\nlinings. I think sterling will be weak all year.\u201d  The pound dropped 1 percent to $1.5018 at 4:40 p.m. London\ntime after sliding to $1.4986, the lowest since July 13, 2010.\nThe U.K. currency depreciated 0.4 percent to 86.43 pence per\neuro.
