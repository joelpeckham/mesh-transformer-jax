 "context": "The following article called 'SEC\u2019s Schapiro Said to Be Open to Compromise on Money-Fund Rule' was published on 2012-05-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission Chairman  Mary Schapiro  is weighing whether to allow\nmoney-market mutual funds to charge a fee on customers who take\nout money from the firms during a liquidity crisis, according to\na person familiar with the discussions.  Such a measure, which  HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA)  has advanced in\nrecent months, could replace other ideas Schapiro has proposed\nand the industry has fought, including one that would prevent\nmoney fund customers from completely withdrawing their money for\n30 days.  SEC staff hasn\u2019t finalized any of the proposed measures,\nincluding how much the liquidity fee might cost and the\ncircumstances in which it might be proposed, said the person,\nwho declined to be identified because the deliberations aren\u2019t\npublic.  John Nester , an agency spokesman, declined to comment.  Once considered among the safest investments, money market\nfunds have been a focus of regulators including Federal Reserve\nChairman  Ben S. Bernanke  since the September 2008 collapse of\nthe $62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund, which triggered a\nbroader run in global financial markets. The withdrawal fee\ncould blunt a lobbying campaign backed by the U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce and internal divisions at the SEC that have blocked\nSchapiro from acting.  Other proposals that  money-market funds  are fighting are\nstill under consideration. For instance, the SEC could require\nmoney-market funds to float their net asset value in addition to\nholding more capital and imposing the liquidity fee, the person\nsaid.  In its initial response to the Reserve Primary Fund\u2019s\ncollapse, the SEC adopted rules that imposed liquidity minimums\non money-market funds along with average maturity limits and new\ndisclosure requirements.  The Wall Street Journal reported today that money market\nfirms are considering the liquidity fee option after discussing\nit with SEC officials on May 8 in Washington.  Internal Divisions  Schapiro has struggled to overcome internal division over\nnew rules for money market funds. The two Republicans on the\nfive-member commission,  Troy Paredes  and Daniel Gallagher, are\nopposed to new rules and Luis Aguilar, a Democrat, is\nuncommitted and seen as the swing vote in the debate.  Schapiro has also faced an intense lobbying campaign from\nthe industry. The Chamber of Commerce bought all of the\nadvertising space in a subway station near the SEC\u2019s Washington\nheadquarters to argue against new rules.  House Financial Services Committee Chairman  Spencer Bachus \nand Representative  Jeb Hensarling , a Texas Republican, wrote a\nletter to Schapiro questioning why she is devoting time to the\nproposal when the SEC has missed multiple deadlines in the\nimplementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.  \u201cI\u2019ve been the subject of lots of vitriol about even\nraising this issue,\u201d Schapiro told lawmakers during a hearing\non April 25.
