 "context": "The following article called 'Swisscom Names Schaeppi CEO to Succeed Schloter' was published on 2013-11-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSwisscom AG (SCMN) ,  Switzerland \u2019s biggest\nphone company, named internal candidate Urs Schaeppi chief\nexecutive officer to succeed Carsten Schloter, who died in July.  Schaeppi, head of the Swiss business, has been interim CEO\nsince his predecessor\u2019s suspected suicide. The appointment is\neffective immediately, the Bern-based company  said today .  The 15-year company veteran will have to come up with a\nstrategy to combat sluggish consumer demand that\u2019s pushing phone\nbills down across  Europe  and in Switzerland. Schaeppi, 53, also\nmust define the future role of Fastweb SpA, the Italian fixed-line company that Swisscom took over in 2007.  \u201cThere is no simple solution for Fastweb and Swisscom\nfaces a dilemma,\u201d Jacques De Greling, an analyst at Natixis\nSecurities in Paris, said in a phone interview. \u201cSelling it\nwould mean admitting to a failure, and Fastweb has been one so\nfar. If they could get a good price for it, a sale wouldn\u2019t be a\nbad thing.\u201d  Under Schloter, Swisscom bought Fastweb for 4.6 billion\neuros ($6.2 billion), seeking to make up for slowing growth in\nSwitzerland, where it made 80 percent of its revenue last year.\nThe deal failed to reverse Swisscom\u2019s fortunes, and the company\nhad its first quarterly loss in about a decade in 2011 due to a\n1.2 billion-franc ($1.3 billion) writedown related to the unit.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  has considered an acquisition of\nFastweb, people familiar with the matter said in June. The\nNewbury, England-based company made two informal approaches this\nyear and in 2011 that were rejected by Swisscom, two of the\npeople said at the time.  Stock Gains  Swisscom  rose  2.3 percent to close at 473 francs in Zurich,\ngiving the company a market value of 24.5 billion francs. The\nstock has gained 20 percent this year.  \u201cFastweb\u2019s performance has been disappointing so far, to\nput it mildly,\u201d De Greling said. A sale \u201cwould mean that a\ncompany that has the problem of being very Swiss would become\neven more Swiss.\u201d  Fastweb isn\u2019t for sale and Swiss will develop its Italian\nunit, Schaeppi told reporters during a press briefing today.  Swisscom also said it\u2019s reorganizing to simplify its\nstructure, combining corporate, network and computer-services\nunits.  Schloter, Swisscom CEO for seven years, was found dead at\nhis home on July 23. Police said they suspect he killed himself.  The company reported today a 2.2 percent increase in third-quarter revenue to 2.87 billion francs, beating analysts\u2019\nestimates of 2.84 billion francs. Net income rose 0.4 percent to\n450 million francs. Swisscom left its full-year  forecasts \nunchanged.
