The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJignesh Shah resigned from the board\nof  Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. , the nation\u2019s biggest\ncommodity trading platform, amid an investigation into the\nfailure of a related spot bourse.  Shah, 46, quit as non-executive vice chairman, according to\na filing yesterday from the company he founded in 2003. He said\nhe\u2019s leaving to help ensure investors aren\u2019t harmed by \u201cmud-slinging\u201d over the probe.  India \u2019s commodities futures market regulator has sought an\naudit of MCX, which counts  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  and Fidelity\nInternational Ltd. as investors, to examine large expenditures\nby the company and related-party transactions. The spot bourse\nbeing investigated, National Spot Exchange Ltd., which Shah also\nfounded, was ordered by the government in July to halt trading.  \u201cInvestors will view Shah\u2019s resignation as a positive,\u201d\nsaid Paras Bothra, vice president for equity research at Ashika\nStock Broking Ltd. in Kolkata. A change in ownership of MCX is a\n\u201cdistinct possibility,\u201d he said.  Shares (MCX)  of MCX, which controls about 90 percent of India\u2019s\n$2.8 trillion commodities futures market, advanced 3.1 percent\nto 488.2 rupees at 10:36 a.m. in Mumbai. The stock has dropped\n23 percent since July 31, when NSEL suspended trading in most\ncommodities.  Financial Technologies (India) Ltd. (FTECH) , which owns 26\npercent of MCX, has plunged 68 percent in the period.  Fairness, Integrity  Forward Markets Commission, India\u2019s commodities futures\nmarket regulator, on Oct. 5 questioned Financial Technologies\u2019\nability to manage MCX. According to the FMC, a person shall be\ndeemed \u201cfit and proper\u201d to run a bourse if the person has a\ngeneral reputation and record of fairness, integrity and is not\ninvolved in any action of fraud and dishonesty.  Shah said a detailed reply has been sent to the regulator\nover concerns it raised about MCX.  Financial Technologies  also\nruns the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, Global Board of Trade in\nMauritius, Bourse Africa in  Botswana , Dubai Gold and Commodity\nExchange and Bahrain Financial Exchange.  Shah quit the board of the MCX-Stock Exchange Ltd., India\u2019s\nnewest equity bourse, in October.  The now defunct NSEL broke rules by permitting the sale of\ngoods traders didn\u2019t keep in its warehouses, according to\nregulators. The turmoil for MCX began with the government\nseeking details on NSEL\u2019s settlement cycle on July 14, and\ndeepened with the suspension of most contracts on the NSEL on\nJuly 31. The exchange was banned from introducing new\nobligations without prior approval on Aug. 6.  CEO Resigns  MCX\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Shreekant Javalgekar, its\nchairman, and three directors quit recently. Investors had been\ncalling for Shah\u2019s resignation.  The number of contracts traded on the MCX fell 38 percent\nin October from July, with volume last month totaling 12.09\nmillion contracts, the least since February 2009, MCX data show.\nVolumes on the rival National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange\nLtd. have increased 5 percent since July.  Shah\u2019s departure may be an attempt to build some confidence\nin MCX, according to Kishore Narne, head of commodity and\ncurrency at Motilal Oswal Commodity Broker Ltd.  MCX appointed Pravir Vohra and G. Ananth Raman as\nindependent directors to the board on Oct. 23, and named Parveen\nKumar Singhal, a deputy managing director, as the chief\nexecutive until a managing director is named.  The Economic Offences Wing of the Mumbai police has\narrested NSEL\u2019s former Chief Executive Officer Anjani Sinha and\ntwo other senior officials after an investors\u2019 group complained\nthe executives diverted funds and failed to settle about 56\nbillion rupees ($911 million) in dues to investors.  The NSEL has failed to meet most of the payment targets set\nunder the supervision of the  Forward Markets Commission , the\ncommodities futures market regulator.  NSEL and Financial Technologies Group will co-operate with\nthe authorities in the probe, the exchange said in a statement\non Sept. 30.
