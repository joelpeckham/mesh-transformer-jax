 "context": "The following article called 'Microsoft Joins Oracle as Computing Companies Fight Patent Suits' was published on 2013-02-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe top lawyers for  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) \nand  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  say a U.S. debate over rampant patent\nlitigation could endanger businesses that rely on such legal\nprotections for their innovative software.  Companies including  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  have said\ntoo many software patents are being used primarily to generate\nlawsuits instead of contributing to new products and services.\nWhile agreeing on that point, Microsoft, the world\u2019s biggest\nsoftware maker, and Oracle say some demands for change go too\nfar in calling for strict limits or even the elimination of\npatents on software.  \u201cMy biggest concern, and the concern of many other\nsoftware companies, is that there\u2019s going to be a move to\nsomehow reduce or diminish protection for software,\u201d Oracle\nGeneral Counsel Dorian Daley said in an interview in  Washington \nyesterday. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any rational reason for\ndoing that.\u201d  Daley and her counterpart at Microsoft,  Brad Smith , joined\nsoftware and manufacturing executives  meeting  yesterday with\nlawmakers and congressional staff members to defend patents for\ncomputer programs.  \u201cWe have a patent system that has important strengths but\nit also has some significant weaknesses,\u201d Smith said in the\nsame interview. \u201cWe need to fix what\u2019s broken but be careful so\nwe don\u2019t break what\u2019s working. It\u2019s all about striking the right\nbalance.\u201d  Yesterday\u2019s  Capitol Hill  session was the latest in a series\nof gatherings across the country as companies that create, sell\nor use software programs debate how Congress or the U.S. Patent\nand  Trademark Office  should respond to the rise of patent\nlitigation.  Serial Lawsuits  Large and small companies are united in their ire at so-\ncalled patent assertion entities, sometimes derided as\n\u201ctrolls,\u201d that claim to have invented aspects of widely used\ntechnologies like online shopping and file lawsuits seeking\nroyalties from dozens or even hundreds of companies.  Of the more than 5,600 patent-infringement lawsuits filed\nin the U.S. last year, more than 12 percent were filed by just\n10 companies over software, according to Bloomberg Law data.  In a Feb. 1 interview, Suzanne Michel, Google\u2019s senior\npatent counsel, said there are \u201cfundamental problems with\nsoftware patents as they are being allowed today\u201d with too many\nthat are broad or vaguely worded.  \u201cThis is not about opposing all software patents; this is\nopposing a certain type of software patent,\u201d she said. \u201cGoogle\nis advocating for really smarter software patents that are good\nfor innovation.\u201d  Loser Pays  Google, Microsoft and Oracle agree on some approaches, such\nas a proposal to make the loser in a patent lawsuit pay the\nwinner\u2019s legal fees. They also support greater transparency at\nthe patent office, more clearly identifying the real owner of a\npatent and requiring applicants to provide more specific\ninformation about their inventions.  Smith said that, by April 1, Microsoft will  post \ninformation on the patents it owns and called on other companies\nto do the same.  Microsoft, Oracle and  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) \nare among companies saying courts and the patent office are\nmaking progress as they implement a 2011 law that revised\nprocedures for reviewing patents and curtailed some litigation.  Those proposals alone don\u2019t go far enough to help smaller\ncompanies that can\u2019t afford to wait for patent-law improvements\nto work their way through the system, said Alan Schoenbaum,\ngeneral counsel of  Rackspace Hosting Inc. (RAX) , a provider of Web-\nbased computing.  Extracting Money  \u201cThe problem is there are a dozen years of issued patents,\nsoftware patents that are in play that are being acquired by\npatent assertion entities, and lawsuits are being filed daily\nagainst small businesses with the intent to extract money,\u201d\nSchoenbaum said in an interview. \u201cThere are patents that never\nshould have been issued, and the defendants don\u2019t have the money\nor adequate resources to defend themselves to take advantage of\nthe new laws.\u201d  Schoenbaum said Congress needs to exempt end users of\nproducts from liability. Many of the serial lawsuits target\nbusinesses using software or other products, rather than the\ndevelopers or manufacturers.  Schoenbaum, whose San Antonio-based company is working on\nan open-source platform for the use of remote servers to store\ndata, said patents do more harm than good.  Vulnerable Projects  \u201cThese open source projects are vulnerable to patent\ntrolls,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the next wave of innovation in our\ncountry.\u201d  Daley, of  Redwood City , California-based Oracle, said\nsoftware products should be eligible for legal protection.  \u201cThe all-software-should-be-free model doesn\u2019t work when\nyou are trying to reap a financial benefit,\u201d Daley said.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit, which\nspecializes in  patent law , is considering a case that could\ndetermine when computer programs are eligible for legal\nprotection.  The patent office is holding meetings on possible changes\nto the way it handles applications for software programs, and is\nconsidering rules requiring more disclosure about the \u201creal\nparty in interest\u201d in patents and applications.  \u201cIn a highly innovative industry, it\u2019s natural you\u2019re\ngoing to have litigation,\u201d Daley said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to\ndo is eliminate that unreasonable, parasitic litigation and\nencourage licensing rather than litigation.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSusan Decker in Washington at \n sdecker1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nBernard Kohn at \n bkohn2@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was 135.24337768554688 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was ",
