 "context": "The following article called 'Worse-Than-Cyprus Debt Load Means Caribbean Defaults to Moody\u2019s' was published on 2013-05-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThree bond restructurings totaling about $9.7 billion in the Caribbean this year are failing to ignite economic growth and may not help the region avoid more defaults, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  The bond swaps this year didn\u2019t go far enough to fixing the Caribbean\u2019s \u201cunsustainable\u201d mix of debt and deficits, Warren Smith, the president of the Caribbean Development Bank, said May 22.  Jamaica  and Belize, which restructured about $9.5 billion in local and global bonds this year for the second time since 2006, face a \u201chigh probability\u201d that they will default again, Moody\u2019s said in a May 20 report.  Among Caribbean island economies, only the Bahamas is expected to grow more than 1.5 percent this year compared with 4 percent for  Latin America , Moody\u2019s said in an earlier report. Without faster growth, repeat defaults may become common as Caribbean governments find it easier to cut bond payments than spending, said Arturo Porzecanski, a professor of international finance at American University in  Washington .  \u201cThese countries are exhibiting an increased unwillingness to pay,\u201d Porzecanski said. \u201cWe may be seeing the birth of a region of serial defaulters.\u201d  The average debt for a Caribbean nation compared with the size of its economy stands at 70 percent, with Jamaica, Antigua & Barbuda and Grenada above the 93 percent ratio that forced Cyprus to seek a European Union-brokered March bailout, according to the  International Monetary Fund  and Moody\u2019s. Jamaica\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio reached 140 percent last year.  \u2018Out of Reach\u2019  \u201cA sustained reduction in debt in the region over the next decade will require a combination of aggressive fiscal consolidation and increased economic growth,\u201d Edward Al-Hussainy, a Moody\u2019s analyst for the Caribbean, wrote in a May 20 report. \u201cHowever, both goals are increasingly out of reach.\u201d  Higher  interest rates  tied to previous restructuring agreements contributed to a 12.7 percent jump in Caribbean debt from 2008 to 2011, reversing a 15 percent decline over the previous three years, the IMF said in a November report. Antigua & Barbuda and St. Kitts & Nevis restructured debt in 2010 and 2012, respectively, making the past three years the highest on record for Caribbean defaults.  \u201cIt\u2019s a self-reinforcing cycle,\u201d Al-Hussainy said in a phone interview from  New York . \u201cOther governments may be looking around and instead of waiting for a crunch, decide to take their chances now.\u201d  Bond Returns  Central American and Caribbean bonds have returned 1.8 percent this year, compared with declines of 1.3 percent for emerging market bonds and 2.1 percent for Latin American debt, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.  Investors are taking advantage of higher yields for Caribbean debt now and betting they can sell ahead of any payment problems, said Carl Ross, managing director at brokerage Oppenheimer & Co. in Atlanta. The results are also skewed, he said, by a 53 percent return on  Belize \u2019s debt this year, which covers a period in which the country emerged from default after skipping a $23 million coupon payment last year.  Even after its restructuring, Belize\u2019s bonds yield 9.7 percent, the most among 58 emerging market economies tracked by JPMorgan\u2019s EMBIG index after Argentina and  Venezuela . Jamaica\u2019s debt yields 8.3 percent. The yield on  Cayman Islands  bonds was 5.6 percent, compared with about 3.5 percent for similarly-rated  China  and  Chile .  The bond rally in Caribbean debt is \u201cmore of a fluke,\u201d Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s not reflected in the fundamentals by any stretch.\u201d  Tourism Data  Belize, on the Caribbean coast in Central America, is forecast to grow 2.5 percent annually through 2015,  Standard & Poor\u2019s  said March 20. Belize this year agreed to pay 56.75 cents on the dollar for $544 million of defaulted bonds after initially offering 20 cents following a missed coupon payment in August. The country\u2019s debt load will fall to 71 percent of GDP this year from 77 percent in 2011, S&P said.  \u201cWe think the debt restructuring only delayed Belize\u2019s problems, and recent efforts to solve fiscal issues have been uninspiring,\u201d Flora Hsu, an  emerging markets  analyst at Nomura Securities International Inc., said in a May 22 report.  Belize\u2019s government will \u201cfine tune\u201d its debt management and \u201cupgrade debt monitoring,\u201d Prime Minister Dean Barrow said in a March 1 speech.  Yields on  Jamaica\u2019s dollar bonds  due in 2019 fell to 7.8 percent yesterday after reaching 9 percent in February when the government undertook a $9 billion local debt restructuring.  Economic Contraction  Jamaica\u2019s GDP has contracted four quarters in a row, falling 0.9 percent in the final three months of 2012. International  reserves  tumbled to $866 million last month, prompting the central bank to say it would start selling a one-year, dollar-linked bond to shore up investor confidence and introduce two new certificates of deposit.  The Jamaican dollar has tumbled 6.2 percent this year through May 24, the most among Latin American and Caribbean currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the Argentine peso.  Jamaica\u2019s local debt swap \u201cbuys a bit of breathing space, but I don\u2019t think it addresses the fundamental issues in that Jamaica is verging on insolvency,\u201d said  Stuart Culverhouse , chief economist at Exotix Ltd. in  London .  To prevent another restructuring, Jamaica\u2019s government established an oversight committee and set up an office in the Ministry of Finance dedicated to implementing economic reforms, Finance Minister Peter Phillips said in a March 16 interview. The IMF said May 21 that the country is making progress in improving its economic prospects, aided by a $932 million loan from the Washington-based lender.  $193 Million  Following the restructurings by Belize and Jamaica, Grenada said on March 15 it would swap $193 million of global bonds as debt-to-GDP burden reached 105 percent. The island previously defaulted in 2004.  Holders of Grenada\u2019s dollar bonds should expect a \u201csignificant\u201d reduction in the value of their holdings as the island seeks its second restructuring since Hurricane Ivan in 2004, said Culverhouse. According to the terms of Grenada\u2019s 2004 restructuring, the coupon on its dollar bonds was set to climb to 4.5 percent in September from 2.5 percent last year, eventually reaching 9 percent in 2018.  \u201cGrenada has simply run out of money,\u201d Culverhouse said on a March 21 conference call.  \u2018One Element\u2019  \u201cThe debt restructuring is only one element of a broad economic strategy to put Grenada\u2019s fiscal house in order, grow the economy and provide jobs,\u201d Carlyle Glean, the island\u2019s then-governor-general, said in a March 27 speech to parliament. \u201cUltimately, it will help Grenada to meet its obligations to its creditors in a timely and sustainable manner.\u201d  Economic pressures are also weighing on countries that don\u2019t have a track record of defaults. Yields on Barbados\u2019s bonds held near a five-year low of 5.96 percent last week. At the same time, tourist visits declined 12 percent in April from a year earlier, the 13th straight month of declines, according to the country\u2019s  central bank . The island nation lost its investment grade rating with Moody\u2019s in December when it was lowered to Ba1, putting the country of 256,000 people in the same category as  Morocco , the  Philippines  and  Guatemala .  \u201cThe country\u2019s growth prospects remain very limited,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. That is \u201ca ratio generally reached only by much wealthier countries with considerably larger economies.\u201d  Ability to Pay  For the government, the cost to service debt is \u201cvery low\u201d at 7 percent of GDP, central bank Governor DeLisle Worrell said at an April 10 news conference. \u201cAs far as the foreign investor is concerned, there\u2019s absolutely no reason why they should have any apprehension about Barbados ability to repay debt.\u201d  With much of the region struggling under elevated debt burdens, the Caribbean Development Bank praised the Cayman Islands and other Caribbean nations under administration by the U.K., which has put limits on borrowing and helped force balanced budgets.  The yield on 2019 dollar bonds sold by the Cayman Islands fell to a record low 2.75 percent on May 16.  \u201cMarkets have been very clear you need to have the right debt-to-GDP ratios,\u201d Rolston Anglin, the deputy premier for the Caymans, said in an interview in  Rio de Janeiro . \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ve done is made a commitment to not incurring central government debt for the next four fiscal years, and will try to live within our means.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Eric Sabo in Panama City at  esabo1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: Bill Faries at  wfaries@bloomberg.net ; David Papadopoulos at  papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 42.249969482421875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
