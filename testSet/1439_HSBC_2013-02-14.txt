The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Group of 20 nations should take\na stronger stance against currency manipulation at a meeting in\nMoscow, Russian Finance Minister  Anton Siluanov  said after\nconflicting statements on the weakening yen roiled markets.  Russia wants more \u201cspecific\u201d language opposing exchange-\nrate interference in the communique that will be issued after\ntalks among finance chiefs this week, Siluanov said in an\ninterview today with Bloomberg Television\u2019s  Ryan Chilcote .\nRussia holds the G-20\u2019s rotating presidency this year.  \u201cThe G-20 countries have always held the position that\ncurrency policy should be based on market conditions,\u201d Siluanov\nsaid. \u201cI think we should take a more specific stance on this.\u201d  Russian central bank First Deputy Chairman  Alexey Ulyukayev \nwarned last month that the world was nearing the brink of a\nfresh \u201ccurrency war\u201d as countries weaken their currencies to\nmake their exports more competitive. The yen has tumbled 17\npercent in the past three months against the dollar. Financial\nmarkets whipsawed two days ago as the Group of Seven major\nindustrialized countries issued a statement viewed by investors\nas accepting a declining yen, only for officials to then split\nover whether Japan was being singled out.  Yen Tolerance  The spotlight now falls on this weekend\u2019s G-20 meeting in\nthe Russian capital as investors question how much tolerance\nthere is for a weaker yen.  G-20 finance chiefs in November called for member nations\nto refrain from competitive devaluations and move rapidly toward\nmore market-based exchange rates. One issue that will be\naddressed in Moscow is how foreign bond purchases can influence\nexchange rates, Siluanov said.  \u201cSharp moves in exchange rates of any country should be\npredictable, and actually shouldn\u2019t happen at all,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe need to speak out more precisely about this issue and\nperhaps move from general phrases to more specific measures.\u201d  New Japanese Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe \u2019s government denies\ndriving a devaluation, saying its two-month effort to revive the\neconomy through looser monetary policy is aimed at ending\ndeflation.  Japanese Stimulus  The yen\u2019s 55 percent surge over the five years through 2011\nhammered Japan\u2019s exporters, and helped spur the Liberal\nDemocratic Party to adopt monetary stimulus as a campaign issue\nduring the election that ushered it back to office in December.  Finance Minister  Taro Aso  on Dec. 31 rejected trading\npartners\u2019 right to criticize Japan\u2019s currency policies. He said\nthat the U.S. should have a stronger dollar and questioned\nwhether major G-20 nations had stuck to pledges from 2009 to\navoid competitive devaluations. During his election campaign,\nAbe said foreign-bond purchases were a possible monetary tool.  G-20 nations will press Japan to clarify its policy toward\nexchange-rate movements, said the Russian finance minister.  \u201cWe have to get to the bottom of this of course, listen to\nour Japanese colleagues and how they explain this and what\ndecisions they will take and what exchange-rate policy they will\nfollow,\u201d Siluanov said.  Major G-20 economies have reached a consensus that market-\ndetermined exchange rates are an \u201cimportant element of firm,\nstable and long-term growth\u201d and that\u2019s it\u2019s not worth\ninterfering with market forces, Ulyukayev told Bloomberg News\ntoday.  Broad Agreement  Still, the confusion surrounding the G-7 stance on the\nyen\u2019s decline makes it unlikely the larger G-20 group can agree\non effective action, according to  Daragh Maher , a currency\nstrategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in London.  \u201cThe G-7 ended with three different interpretations of a\ncommunique,\u201d Maher said in a radio interview today on\n\u201cBloomberg the First Word\u201d with  Michael McKee . \u201cWhat\u2019s the\nlikelihood we can get agreement from 20 people around a table?\u201d  If Japan wants to see the yen sold against other G-7\ncurrencies, \u201cit will very likely happen,\u201d  Steven Englander ,\nhead of Group of 10 currency strategy at Citigroup Inc., said in\nan e-mailed research note yesterday.
