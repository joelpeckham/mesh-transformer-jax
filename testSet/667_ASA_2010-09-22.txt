 "context": "The following article called 'Norway May Boost Oil Production by 16 Billion Barrels' was published on 2010-09-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNorway, the world\u2019s seventh-biggest\noil producer, has the potential to produce an additional 16\nbillion barrels of oil, which would extend output beyond 2050,\naccording to a report commissioned by the oil ministry.  By reducing costs, improving technology and introducing\nregulatory changes, producers offshore Norway could increase\nrecovery rates from existing oil and gas fields to 60 percent\nfrom today\u2019s average of 46 percent, said the report issued\ntoday. That could add about 16 billion barrels of oil to be\nproduced offshore Norway, in addition to today\u2019s reserves and\nrecoverable oil in discovered and undiscovered deposits.  \u201cThis is work that needs to be done now,\u201d Oil Minister\n Terje Riis-Johansen  said today at a press conference in Oslo.\n\u201cIt will soon be too late. It is fully possible that\nsignificant resources on the Norwegian shelf will never be\nutilized if we don\u2019t get control over costs.\u201d  The government is urging producers such as state-controlled\nStatoil ASA and  ConocoPhillips  to improve recovery rates from\nthe country\u2019s oil deposits. Output has almost halved in the past\ndecade after 40 years of pumping oil and natural gas from fields\nsuch as Ekofisk, Oseberg and Troll.  Cheaper Rigs  The report recommended 44 measures to enhance oil recovery\nfrom producing fields, including revising the voting rights\namong license partners to enable those with a majority to make\nthe final decision and introducing simpler well designs that\ncould use smaller, cheaper rigs. The government\u2019s push to\nattract more companies to boost exploration offshore may have\nimpacted production at existing fields.  \u201cThere\u2019s probably been greater priority given to\nexploration than production and we cautiously recommend that the\nministry takes a look at this and asks itself whether this has\nhad an effect and should this be adjusted,\u201d Knut Aam, head of\nthe commission responsible for the report, said today in Oslo.  Statoil aims to spend 8 billion kroner ($1.4 billion) on\nupgrading installations this year, while Conoco in March\nproposed development plans for the North Sea Eldfisk and Ekofisk\nSouth fields valued at as much as $13 billion to prolong their\nproduction lives. The Norwegian  Petroleum Directorate  estimates\n54 percent of crude in existing fields may be left underground\nif companies fail to improve recovery.  ConocoPhillips has raised the recovery rate at Ekofisk to\nmore than 50 percent from about 18 percent in 1971, spokesman\nStig Kvendseth said in an interview earlier this year. The field\nproduced about 178,000 barrels of oil day last year, down from a\npeak of almost 300,000 a day in 2002.  The Petroleum Directorate set a 10-year goal of adding 5\nbillion barrels to reserves by 2015, of which two-thirds were\nexpected to come from enhanced recovery. The Directorate\nestimates the total resource base offshore Norway at between\n10.6 billion and 17 billion standard cubic meters of oil\nequivalents (67 billion and 107 billion barrels), of which 5.3\nbillion standard cubic meters have been produced. Oil is\nclassified as reserves when it\u2019s approved for production.
