 "context": "The following article called 'Draghi Euro Humbles Thought Leaders Seeing End of Union' was published on 2012-09-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEuropean Central Bank President  Mario Draghi , embracing policies dismissed by his predecessor, is forcing euro bears to capitulate.  Since July 26, when Draghi said he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the 17-nation euro, the currency has appreciated versus each of its 16 major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. The cost to protect against a default on government debt in western Europe tumbled to a 15-month low and confidence in the region\u2019s banking system is improving, with bank stocks rallying 33 percent since June 1, exceeding the 18 percent gain in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  While former ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  kept the central bank from propping up debt-laden governments by limiting purchases of their securities as the almost three-year crisis deepened, Draghi has done the opposite since he took over in November. His decisions are placing everyone from former International Monetary  Fund (MERKX)  Chief Economist  Kenneth Rogoff  to fund manager  Axel Merk  on the wrong side of the market.  \u201cIt has been a game changer, and Draghi has done the heavy lifting,\u201d Merk, president and founder of Merk Investments LLC in  Palo Alto , California, said in a Sept. 13 telephone interview. His $526 million Merk Hard Currency Fund has jumped 3.38 percent in the past month, beating 92 percent of its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Breakup Odds  Draghi, 65, has shown a greater willingness than Trichet to use the ECB\u2019s balance sheet to aid Spain and Italy, and he relaxed his predecessor\u2019s insistence that senior bondholders at crippled banks shouldn\u2019t suffer losses in bailouts.  Merk, who said he was \u201cvery negative\u201d on the euro earlier this year because of what he called the dysfunctional process in resolving Europe\u2019s crisis, has turned into a buyer. \u201cThe euro has much higher to go from here, though it\u2019s not out of the woods yet,\u201d he said.  Chances of a breakup of the monetary union by the end of 2013 fell to 50 percent from more than 60 percent in late July, according to Dublin-based  Intrade.com  data, after Draghi gave details last week of a plan announced in August to buy debt of members including Spain and Italy.  The euro soared to a four-month high of $1.3169 on Sept. 14, before trading at $1.3139 as of 10:20 a.m. in  New York . It appreciated 3.93 percent over the past month against a basket of nine other developed-market currencies, including the yen, pound and Australian dollar, and is the biggest gainer, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Highest Forecast  What European policy makers \u201chave shown so far is their willingness to support the currency union and do as much as they can,\u201d said  Mary Nicola , a New York-based currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA.  BNP Paribas has the joint highest year-end estimate for the euro of any of the 46 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg, calling for the currency to strengthen to $1.35. The euro\u2019s lifetime average since it was created in 1999 is about $1.21.  Rising confidence in Europe is helping global markets. The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of equities has soared 17 percent since its low this year on June 4. The Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI Index of commodities is up 25 percent from its 2012 bottom on June 21. Corporate bonds have returned 4.8 percent since the end of March, including reinvested interest, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Bank stocks in the  Stoxx Europe (SXXP)  600 Index have climbed to their highest level since March 21.  Sentiment Switch  Just three months ago bets against Draghi\u2019s ability to hold the monetary union together reached record highs.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 214,418, the most ever, on June 5, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. That amounts to a $33.4 billion bet against the euro.  Protection against losses on the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers with credit-default swaps rose more than 50 percent between March and July. Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds jumped to a euro-era record of 7.75 percent on July 27 as the nation sought a bailout of its banks.  Rogoff, who is now an economics professor at  Harvard University  in Cambridge, Massachusetts, told  Tom Keene  on \u201cBloomberg Surveillance\u201d July 27 that while he expected Greece, which held consecutive elections in May and June amid public opposition to spending cuts after undergoing the largest ever sovereign-debt restructuring, to \u201cultimately\u201d leave the euro, \u201cthe real question is what is going to happen to the broader euro?\u201d  \u2018Viable Solution\u2019  Carmen Reinhart , also a professor at Harvard and the co- author with Rogoff of \u201cThis Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\u201d said at the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit in New York Sept. 13 that euro-area governments must pursue deeper debt reduction if they are to end the region\u2019s three-year fiscal turmoil. \u201cA viable solution is being put off the table,\u201d she said. \u201cAttempts to work on debt restructuring apart from austerity is what\u2019s required within the euro.\u201d  The debt turmoil has slowed economic growth. The Kiel-based Institute for the World Economy said Sept. 13 in an e-mailed statement that growth in Germany, Europe\u2019s biggest economy, will slow to 0.8 percent in 2012 from 3 percent last year. The euro zone may shrink 0.5 percent this year, according to the median of 50 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  Market Divergence  Foreign-exchange strategists cut their forecasts for the euro throughout the summer. They expect the common currency to fall to $1.23 by the end of the year, compared with the median estimate of $1.28 in a May survey. That\u2019s the second-largest decline among major currency pairs behind franc-dollar forecasts, which have dropped 2 percent.  That has led to the biggest divergence between 2012 fourth- quarter forecasts and current trading levels in 14 months.  Rising borrowing costs and diminished confidence in the euro prompted Draghi to signal in a July 26 speech to the Global Investment Conference in  London  that the ECB was ready to buy bonds to curb rising yields and boost confidence.  \u201cWithin our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro,\u201d he said. \u201cBelieve me, it will be enough.\u201d  What\u2019s different from Trichet\u2019s policy is that the plan proposed by Draghi is open ended and doesn\u2019t require the ECB to be treated with more seniority than other bondholders. The ECB\u2019s balance sheet  swelled  by about 442 billion euros ($580 billion) to 2.33 trillion euros during Trichet\u2019s last year as ECB president. The central bank\u2019s holdings have increased by 745 billion euros since Draghi took over in November.  A \u2019Genius\u2019  ECB Governing Council member Panicos Demetriades said the bank might not have to spend a cent on  government bonds . The threat of unlimited buying under the ECB\u2019s new bond-purchase program may mean that \u201cin the end, action is not needed,\u201d Demetriades, who heads the Central Bank of Cyprus, said Sept. 12 in an interview in Nicosia.  Germany\u2019s top constitutional court on Sept. 12 rejected efforts to block a permanent 500 billion-euro euro-area rescue fund, which is meant to work in tandem with the unlimited bond- purchase program aimed at containing  interest rates  in countries such as Spain and Italy. The ECB may  buy bonds  with maturities as long as three years on the secondary markets of countries that ask Europe\u2019s bailout fund to purchase their debt on the primary exchanges.  \u201cThe way he proceeded, I\u2019ve called him a genius,\u201d Merk said of Draghi. \u201cHe has managed to do what the politicians haven\u2019t been able to do without becoming too political. He\u2019s moving the responsibility to political bodies.\u201d  Dollar Depreciation  The currency is also getting a boost from a weakening dollar, as the Federal Reserve embarks on a third round of bond purchases, or quantitative easing, buying $40 billion a month in mortgage bonds to inject cash into the economy and attempt to bring down unemployment.  Intercontinental Exchange Inc.\u2019s Dollar Index slumped as much as 19 percent to 72.696 from 89.624 as the Fed printed currency to buy $2.3 trillion of mortgage and Treasury debt in two rounds of QE from December 2008 to June 2011. It\u2019s down more than 6 percent from its intraday high this year of 84.1 on July 24 to 78.858.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit swaps on 15 governments fell to 188 basis points last week, the lowest level since the series started trading in March. A previous version of the index that included Greece was last this low in May 2011.  Options Bets  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10 million euros of debt from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Options traders have eased bets the euro is going to fall against the dollar by year-end since Draghi hinted the ECB would purchase debt at the Aug. 2 central bank meeting.  The three-month so-called 25-delta risk reversal rate was minus 0.79 percent today, signaling greater demand for euro puts that give the right to sell the shared currency, versus calls. The rate was minus 2.05 percent on Aug. 2 and minus 4.39 percent on Nov. 17, the most since at least 2003 based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures traders decreased their bets that the euro will decline against the  U.S. dollar  last week, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and other large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with those on a gain, so-called net shorts, was 93,658 on Sept. 11, compared with net shorts of 102,306 a week earlier.  Mighty ECB  \u201cWe are expecting some more upside on euro-dollar to develop,\u201d said  Ian Stannard , head of European foreign-exchange strategy in London at Morgan Stanley, which capitulated last week on its call for a lower euro.  Morgan Stanley said in a report dated Sept. 13 that it now expects the currency will rise to $1.34 by Dec. 31, rather than fall to $1.19.  \u201cOver the years, global investors have learned that it does not pay to fight the Fed,\u201d  Holger Schmieding , chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London, said this month in an interview. \u201cThose betting on the demise of the euro may now have to realize that the ECB is as mighty as the Fed.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story: John Detrixhe in New York at   jdetrixhe1@bloomberg.net ; Liz Capo McCormick in New York at   emccormick7@bloomberg.net ; Allison Bennett in New York at   abennett23@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dave Liedtka at   dliedtka@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 33.869232177734375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
