 "context": "The following article called 'Schiff Bidding Seen Making Most Expensive Deal Pricier' was published on 2012-11-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSchiff Nutrition International Inc. (SHF) \nhas traders betting that what\u2019s already the most expensive deal\nin the vitamin industry is about to get even pricier.  Shares of Schiff ended yesterday 5.1 percent above a $42-a-\nshare bid from  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) , which last week\ntopped  Bayer AG (BAYN) \u2019s $34 offer for the Salt Lake City-based maker\nof Airborne cold-prevention remedies and other supplements. No\nother U.S. transaction valued at $1 billion or more is trading\nthat far above its deal price, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg, signaling traders who profit from acquisitions\nanticipate a higher offer.  Investors are betting Bayer will match or exceed the $1.4\nbillion bid and push Reckitt Benckiser to pay up for a bigger\nfoothold in the $30 billion market for vitamins and supplements,\nsaid Tullett Prebon Plc. Schiff would give Bayer more sales in\nthe U.S. and brands such as MegaRed krill oil that complement\nits over-the-counter medicines, said DZ Bank AG.  Johnson &\nJohnson (JNJ)  or  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  may also weigh bids, Wall Street Access\nCorp. said. Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s offer values Schiff at 4.3 times\nsales, already the vitamin industry\u2019s most expensive deal larger\nthan $100 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cThe market is definitely pricing in a higher bid,\u201d Peter Lobravico, New York-based vice president of merger arbitrage\ntrading and sales at Wall Street Access Corp., said in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cThese are both very deep-pocketed\ncompanies and this is a small asset in the grand scheme of\nthings. This one is really going to come down to whoever is\nwilling to pay the higher price. The market knows that and\nthat\u2019s why it is trading 5 percent through what is already an\nextremely large premium.\u201d  \u2018Significant Synergies\u2019  Becky Herrick, a spokeswoman for Schiff who works at LHA,\ndidn\u2019t respond to a phone or e-mail message seeking comment.  Christian Hartel, a spokesman for Leverkusen, Germany-based\nBayer, declined to comment on Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s counterbid,\nand declined to comment when asked if Bayer would raise its\noffer. A representative for Reckitt Benckiser declined to\ncomment on whether it would be prepared to raise the offer if\nthe bidding for Schiff escalated.  In announcing its bid on Nov. 15 after the close of U.S.\ntrading, Reckitt Benckiser said it expects \u201csignificant\nsynergies\u201d from a takeover of Schiff. The Slough, England-based\ncompany said it\u2019s prepared to sign a merger agreement\n\u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the one Schiff has with Bayer and\n\u201clooks forward to engaging with Schiff\u2019s board and is confident\nthat they will recognize it as a superior proposal.\u201d  Next Steps  Bayer held meetings to assess the situation and evaluate\nnext steps, three people close to the company who declined to be\nidentified because the deliberations are private said last week.\nNo final decision had been made on whether it would make a\ncounterbid or walk away, the people said then.  Bayer\u2019s Oct. 29 agreement with Schiff allows the U.S.\ncompany to accept an unsolicited higher offer within 30 days,\nprovided it pays Bayer a $22 million breakup fee.  Schiff\u2019s shares traded above $42 in the two days since\nReckitt Benckiser announced its bid, as merger-arbitrage traders\nbet that the company would receive an even higher offer.  \u201cArbs believe there is the potential for a bidding war,\u201d\nAndrew Rosen, managing director of equity derivatives at United\nFirst Partners LLC, an event-driven research firm, said in a\nphone interview. \u201cThis is a sensible strategic bolt-on\nacquisition for these guys and that tends to encourage a bidding\nprocess.\u201d  No Prescriptions  Yesterday\u2019s trading indicated that investors expected a\ncounterbid of at least $46, Rosen said.  A takeover of Schiff would help Bayer,  Germany \u2019s biggest\ndrugmaker, bolster its U.S. sales of treatments that don\u2019t\nrequire prescriptions, according to Peter Spengler, a Frankfurt-\nbased analyst at DZ Bank. Sales of consumer health products in\nNorth America accounted for just 6.3 percent of the aspirin\nmanufacturer\u2019s 36.5 billion euros ($46.7 billion) of revenue\nlast year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cFor Bayer, it\u2019s important to increase its footprint in\nthe U.S. in over-the-counter products,\u201d Spengler said in a\nphone interview. While Bayer ranks as one of the top-three over-\nthe-counter drugmakers worldwide, it\u2019s only among the 10 largest\nin the U.S., he said.  Schiff\u2019s products, such as MegaRed krill oil that promotes\nheart health, also complement many of the medicines Bayer makes\nand it could leverage those brands globally, he said.  \u2018Game-Changer\u2019  Revenue at Schiff, which paid $150 million to buy Airborne\nHealth Inc. in March, may jump 45 percent in the year that ends\nMay 31 to about $377 million, according to  analysts\u2019 estimates \ncompiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s still just 1 percent of what\nReckitt Benckiser Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor says is\na  $30 billion  global market for vitamins, minerals and\nsupplements.  That was a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for investors that were ready\nto sell to Bayer for $34 a share, said Sachin Shah, a Jersey\nCity, New Jersey-based special situations and merger arbitrage\nstrategist at Tullett Prebon.  \u201cNobody knew the market opportunity was that great until\nReckitt\u2019s CEO pointed it out,\u201d Shah said in a phone interview.\n\u201cReckitt\u2019s looking at it and saying this is a $30 billion pie\nof which Schiff has such a small sliver. They\u2019re willing to pay\nabove Bayer because they see the opportunity.\u201d  Vitamin Leader  Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Strepsils cold remedies and\nGaviscon heartburn relief, and Schiff have products that are\nalready sold by some of the same retailers, such as Wal-Mart\nStores Inc. and  Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , and there\u2019s an\nopportunity to sell Schiff\u2019s brands through other distribution\nchannels, Kapoor said on a conference call with analysts the\nnext day.  An acquisition of Schiff would propel Reckitt Benckiser to\nthe U.S. leader in vitamins and supplements and help shield it\nfrom other seasonal businesses, according to Deborah Aitken, a\nLondon-based analyst for Bloomberg Industries.  Investors are anticipating that Bayer will at least match\nthe $42 a share that Reckitt Benckiser is willing to pay and\nthat the bidding won\u2019t stop there, Shah said.  \u201cReckitt\u2019s not messing around,\u201d he said. \u201cReckitt\u2019s CEO\nhas given himself room to bid even higher if Bayer comes back\nin. The market is saying that this situation is going to\ncontinue and I would probably agree.\u201d  Other companies, including J&J, the world\u2019s biggest maker\nof health-care products, or Pfizer, the biggest drug maker,\ncould seek to compete in the bidding for Schiff, said Lobravico\nof Wall Street Access.  Deep Pockets  Food manufacturers with nutrition lines may also be lured\nto the company, whose products include Tiger\u2019s Milk energy bars,\nhe said.  Schiff \u201ckind of crosses the line between health care and\nthe food industry,\u201d Lobravico said. \u201cThere probably is a list\nof five to 10 other companies with deep pockets that could step\nin here as well.\u201d  Al Wasilewski, a spokesman for New Brunswick, New Jersey-\nbased J&J, declined to comment on whether the company would be\ninterested in bidding for Schiff.  \u201cPfizer Consumer Healthcare will continue to drive growth\nthrough core brands,\u201d Mackay Jimeson, a spokesman for  New York- \nbased Pfizer, wrote in an e-mail. He declined to comment on\nwhether the company would be interested in acquiring Schiff.  While Schiff\u2019s product line is attractive and Bayer has the\nresources to boost its bid, the company tends to be \u201cextremely\ndisciplined in terms of M&A valuation\u201d and may be hesitant to\ncounter Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s offer, according to Alistair Campbell, a London-based analyst at Berenberg Bank.  Not Crucial  \u201cTo push on more from here, I think probably is a stretch\ntoo far for them in terms of valuation,\u201d Campbell said in a\nphone interview. \u201cBayer does want to try to grow the health-\ncare side of the business, but I don\u2019t think Schiff was ever an\nabsolute must-have target for them. It\u2019s a good target. But I\ndon\u2019t get the sense that strategically, it\u2019s a crucial thing to\nhave.\u201d  The competing bid from Reckitt Benckiser values Schiff\u2019s\nequity at 4.3 times sales in the last 12 months, compared with a\nrevenue multiple of 3.5 based on Bayer\u2019s offer, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. Reckitt Benckiser is ascribing the\nhighest valuation to Schiff\u2019s revenue of any deal for a maker of\nvitamins and nutrition products greater than $100 million, the\ndata show. The industry median is 2.7.  Bidding Room  \u201cReckitt Benckiser was more aggressive in terms of a price\nthey were willing to bid,\u201d Ronald Koehler, a Frankfurt-based\nanalyst at Main First Bank AG, said in a phone interview.\n\u201cAlready that value is kind of stretched\u201d and a bid from Bayer\ntopping that \u201cis definitely something that they would have\ndifficulty explaining to investors.\u201d  There\u2019s still room to boost the price without overpaying,\naccording to Tullett Prebon\u2019s Shah. He estimates that Reckitt\nBenckiser is valuing Schiff at 3.5 times estimated sales for\n2013. Increasing that by one \u201cturn\u201d to 4.5 times sales would\nimply $55 a share, which is likely the ceiling, Shah said.  \u201cAfter that it becomes just ego-oriented and the chances\nof value destruction for the acquirer\u2019s shareholders are\nprobably high,\u201d he said. Still, \u201cI am betting that it doesn\u2019t\ntake very much for it to get to the $50 level and get to that\none turn extra of payment.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nTara Lachapelle in  New York  at \n tlachapelle@bloomberg.net ;\nBrooke Sutherland in New York at \n bsutherland7@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSarah Rabil at \n srabil@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Johnson & Johnson was 53.659027099609375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Johnson & Johnson was ",
