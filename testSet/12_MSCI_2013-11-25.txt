Preferreds, which give holders\nhigher payouts without influence over how the business is run,\nstill trade at an average  discount  of 51 percent to common\nshares and have dividend yields about twice as large.  Companies in South Korea\u2019s benchmark Kospi index spent more\nthan a decade building a $150 billion cash hoard in the wake of\nthe Asian financial crisis, giving them a larger pot with which\nto reward  investors .

The nation\u2019s currency lost half its\nvalue in 1997 and the economy contracted as much as 7.3 percent\nat the height of the financial crisis.  \u201cThe situation now is different,\u201d Julian Mayo, who helps\nmanage about $2.5 billion in emerging markets as the co-chief\ninvestment officer at Charlemagne Capital Ltd. in  London , said\nby e-mail on Nov. 19. \u201cBalance sheets are stronger.\u201d  South Korean preferred shares have outpaced returns on\ncommon shares by the most since pricing for all the biggest\nsecurities became available in 2003. This year\u2019s mean advance of\n36 percent compares with an average increase of 7.7 percent in\nglobal counterparts with a market value of at least $100\nmillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Petroleo\nBrasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil \u2019s state-owned oil producer, climbed 5.9\npercent while  Germany \u2019s Volkswagen AG rose 13 percent.  Relative Performance  \u201cThe attractiveness of the discount on preferred shares\nhas piqued investors\u2019 interest\u201d in South Korea, Samir Shah, an\ninvestment manager at Advance Emerging Capital in London, said\nby e-mail on Nov. 12. His firm has invested in the Weiss Korea\nOpportunity Fund, which buys South Korean preferred stock.

Bigger Payouts  While Samsung Electronics said this month it may boost the\ndividend yield on its shares, some investors were disappointed\nby the size of the proposed increase.  The world\u2019s largest smartphone maker said on Nov. 6 it may\nlift dividends to 1 percent of its average stock  price , up from\nabout 0.6 percent last year. Payouts for the company\u2019s preferred\nstock have typically been 50 won per share higher than for the\ncommon, which fell 2.3 percent on the day Samsung announced its\ndividend plan.  Overseas investors are increasingly focused on efforts by\nSouth Korean businesses to return cash to shareholders, Lim Soo Gyoon, an analyst at Samsung Securities Co., said by phone on\nNov. 19.  Companies in the Kospi gauge lifted their holdings of cash\nand near-cash items by 12 percent in 2012 to the highest level\nsince Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1992.

The 1.6 percent dividend yield on Hyundai\u2019s preferred\nis twice as big as the 0.75 percent payout on common shares of\nthe nation\u2019s biggest automaker.  \u201cPreferred stocks are being re-evaluated,\u201d said Hoon Lee,\nan analyst at  Korea  Investment & Securities Co. who recommends\npreferred shares of Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor and LG\nChem, the nation\u2019s biggest chemical maker.  Expectations that corporate governance in South Korea will\nimprove is also driving the rally in preferreds, according to\nMidas International Asset Management Ltd.
