The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAs short sellers push bearish wagers\nagainst  RadioShack Corp. (RSH)  to a four-year high, options traders\nare increasing bets that the cheapest U.S. specialty retailer\nwill become a takeover target.  Almost 24 percent of RadioShack\u2019s shares are currently\n shorted , the most since January 2008 and four times the average\nof the Standard & Poor\u2019s Midcap 400 Index, according to New\nYork-based research firm Data Explorers. After posting the\nsecond-steepest two-year  decline  in the S&P Midcap 400,  Fort\nWorth , Texas-based RadioShack trades at 5.8 times profit, the\nlowest of any specialty retailer in America worth more than $500\nmillion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  While RadioShack\u2019s  earnings  are shrinking because of\nstagnant  consumer spending , rising dependence on mobile-phone\nsales and lower-than-projected revenue from Sprint Nextel Corp.,\nit\u2019s also one of only two companies in the industry valued at a\n discount  to net assets. The cost of calls to buy shares priced\n10 percent above RadioShack\u2019s stock reached a five-year high\nthis week versus puts to sell on comparable one-month contracts,\nsignaling some traders may now be speculating the company is\ncheap enough to attract a takeover offer, said Frederic Ruffy, a\nsenior options strategist at WhatsTrading.com.  \u201cThey are in a tough situation,\u201d  Todd Lowenstein , who\nhelps oversee about $17 billion for Highmark Capital Management\nInc. in  Los Angeles , said in a phone interview. \u201cYou have\npeople who, in the current scheme, are willing to bet negatively,\nbut ultimately there\u2019s a price for somebody to come in and say\nit\u2019s attractive. Everything has a price. There will be vultures\nthat will circle and will be willing to step in at a price. This\nthing is cheap.\u201d  Declining Profit  Eric Bruner, a spokesman for RadioShack, said the company\ndoesn\u2019t comment on market speculation.  RadioShack rose 1.3 percent to $7.57 at 10:49 a.m. in New\nYork.  RadioShack, which opened its first namesake store in  1921 ,\nhas almost 7,300 locations in the U.S. and  Mexico , including\nmobile centers in Target Corp. stores. It sells everything from\nGPS navigation systems to metal detectors and mobile phones. In\nSeptember, company-operated stores also began carrying Verizon\nWireless products and services.  Last month RadioShack suspended share repurchases and\ndisclosed preliminary fourth-quarter profit that was a third of\nthe amount analysts estimated because of holiday promotions amid\n\u201congoing pressure\u201d on consumer spending and\n\u201cunderperformance\u201d in the Sprint wireless business.  Short Sellers  The Jan. 30 announcement sent the stock tumbling 30 percent\nthe next day, the biggest decline in at least 30 years, to $7.18\na share, the lowest since March 2009. RadioShack has now  lost 61\npercent  in the last two years, reducing the company\u2019s market\nvalue to $746 million as of yesterday, while the  S&P Midcap 400 \ngained 39 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Almost 24 million of the 99.8 million outstanding shares of\nRadioShack were being shorted as of Feb. 7, according to  Data\nExplorers . In a short sale, traders sell borrowed stock on the\nassumption the price will decline and enable them to profit by\nbuying the shares back at a lower price.  At 24 percent, the proportion of bearish bets against\nRadioShack is now higher than 98 percent of companies in the S&P\nMidcap 400, the data show. Companies in the index have average\nshort interest of 5.2 percent. A year ago, less than 4 percent\nof RadioShack\u2019s shares were being sold short.  Debt Market  The debt market is also signaling a decline as credit\ninvestors pay the most ever to protect against a default. Credit\nswaps tied to RadioShack rose to a record $971,105 to protect\n$10 million of debt on Jan. 31, the day after it reported\npreliminary earnings, according to data provider CMA. Default\nswaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its\nobligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.  After losing $1.7 billion in market value in the last two\nyears, RadioShack has fallen to 5.8 times earnings, the lowest\nprice-earnings ratio of any U.S. specialty retailer worth more\nthan $500 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The industry\naverage is 18.3 times.  The January stock decline sparked by the disappointing\nearnings report pushed RadioShack down to 0.9 times  book value ,\nthe lowest since at least 1990, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. The shares still trade at a 7 percent discount to net\nassets, cheaper than every company in the industry group except\nfor OfficeMax Inc., the data show.  Best Buy, Sears  \u201cAny time a company is trading at below book value or\nbelow tangible book value, it\u2019s trading below its liquidation\nvalue,\u201d said Highmark Capital\u2019s Lowenstein. \u201cSuitors, whether\nstrategic or financial, would tend to be very interested in\nthese kinds of cases.\u201d  RadioShack, which failed to sell itself in 2010, may now be\ncheap enough to attract buyers, according to Lowenstein. At\nleast three private equity firms dropped out of the bidding in\n2010, Bloomberg News reported at the time, citing people\nfamiliar with the discussions.  The company operated more than 6,000  retail locations  as of\nSept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. Almost all of\nRadioShack\u2019s locations are leased rather than owned.  While RadioShack was a compelling takeover target in the\npast for  Best Buy Co. (BBY) ,  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  or a private equity\nfirm, it\u2019s now less likely to find a buyer as RadioShack and\nrival retailers combat increasing sales on the Internet, said\n Sachin Shah , a  Jersey City , New Jersey-based special situations\nand merger arbitrage strategist at Tullett Prebon Plc.  \u2018Dangerous Situation\u2019  \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a dangerous situation in the context that\nthe business model may be eroding,\u201d Shah said in a phone\ninterview. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cyclical situation, it is systemic. Is\nRadioShack cheap? Yes, it is if you have a buyer, and it\u2019s not\nclear to me that there is a buyer out there.\u201d  Options traders  are growing increasingly bullish. The cost\nof calls to buy the stock versus puts to sell jumped 29 percent\nfrom its Jan. 27 low to a five-year high on Feb. 8. That was the\nbiggest gain in such a number of days since March 2010,\naccording to  data  on 30-day options compiled by Bloomberg. As of\nFeb. 8, calls that pay off if RadioShack rises 10 percent cost\n1.1 times more than comparable puts on one-month contracts, the\ndata show. The ratio was 1.06 yesterday, the data show.  Some traders may be using RadioShack call options to\nprotect shares they sold short in case the stock rises and\ncreates a so-called short squeeze, said Alec Levine, an equity\nderivatives strategist at Newedge Group SA in  New York . In a\nshort squeeze, traders with short positions are forced to buy\nthe securities to cover their positions and limit losses while\nthe surge of buying results in even higher prices.  \u201cIt\u2019s possible that this is showing just straight\nspeculative buying on the potential for a takeover,\u201d Ruffy, who\nanalyzes the options market for WhatsTrading.com in New York,\nsaid in a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s limited downside at these\nlevels and potential for big upside.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nTara Lachapelle in New York at \n tlachapelle@bloomberg.net ;\nRita Nazareth in New York at \n rnazareth@bloomberg.net .
