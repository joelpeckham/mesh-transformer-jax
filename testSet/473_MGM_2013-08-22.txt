The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEcho Entertainment Group Ltd. (EGP) ,\nfacing a challenge to its exclusive Sydney casino license from\nbillionaire James Packer\u2019s Crown Ltd., wants a bigger site in\nQueensland\u2019s state capital to target Asian gamblers.  Echo\u2019s existing casinos in the state, in Brisbane, the Gold\nCoast and Townsville, are too small to attract overseas\ntourists, Chief Executive Officer John Redmond said in a phone\ninterview yesterday. Echo is in talks with Queensland\u2019s\ngovernment about the Brisbane relocation, and the plan is a  key\npriority  for the year to June, it said in a presentation.  Both Packer and Redmond are banking on  Australia  emulating\nthe performance of  Singapore , where large resorts opened by\n Genting Singapore Plc (GENS)  and  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  had $5.2 billion\nin sales last year. Echo wants to expand its Queensland sites as\nPacker develops plans for a A$1.3 billion ($1.2 billion) Sydney\ncasino tower to attract high-rolling gamblers who wagered A$23.8\nbillion at Echo\u2019s gaming tables last year.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have a compelling enough offering to attract\npeople\u201d to Echo\u2019s sites in the Gold Coast and Brisbane, where\nits hotel is housed inside the sandstone former state Treasury\nbuilding, Redmond said. \u201cYou need to build or develop something\nat a scale that allows you to compete with the rest of the\nworld.\u201d  Queensland\u2019s Plans  Queensland, the nation\u2019s most indebted state with a deficit\nforecast at A$7.7 billion for the 12 months ending June, is\nconsidering proposals for new casino resorts in the Gold Coast\nand Cairns as a mining boom slows.  The state government is studying a project proposed by Hong\nKong-based businessman Tony Fung for a A$4.2 billion resort in\nCairns on the Great Barrier Reef with nine luxury hotels and\n1,200 apartments. It\u2019s also shortlisted bidders for a resort and\ncruise ship terminal to add  A$750 million  of annual tourism\nrevenue to the Gold Coast.  The Gold Coast market isn\u2019t big enough to support an\nadditional casino, Redmond, a former co-CEO at  MGM Resorts\nInternational (MGM) , said in an interview in April.  Revenue from Echo\u2019s Queensland properties, which also\ninclude a casino and conference center in the Great Barrier Reef\nport of Townsville, fell 3.3 percent in the 12 months ended June\namid weak consumer sentiment, the company said.  The amount bet by VIP gamblers, high-rolling tourists who\nreceive perks and free travel in return for wagering tens of\nthousands of dollars per trip, dropped 19 percent to A$1.88\nbillion during the year at its sites in the state, according to\nthe presentation. At the company\u2019s Star property in Sydney, VIP\nwagers rose 29 percent to A$22 billion.  Cost Cuts  The company was discussing internally how it would adjust\nits spending plans in response to the threat from Crown, Redmond\nsaid. Crown\u2019s Sydney casino project, at the Barangaroo\ndevelopment west of the city\u2019s main business district, was last\nmonth moved to the third stage of a state government approval\nprocess, beating off competition from an Echo proposal to expand\nits Star site.  The company aims to reduce costs by about A$60 million by\nthe end of next year as it seeks cash to fund capital spending.  With careful cost control, it\u2019s possible to build a resort\nfor the Brisbane-Gold Coast region comparable to a A$2 billion\ninvestment for about A$700 million, Redmond said on a conference\ncall in February.  Echo has set up a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to buy items\nsuch as cutlery and furniture direct from  China  at a lower cost,\nRedmond said.  \u201cThis stuff doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my\nentire career in the most competitive market in the world.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDavid Fickling in Sydney at \n dfickling@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nStephanie Wong at \n swong139@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MGM Resorts International was 16.4966983795166 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MGM Resorts International was ",
