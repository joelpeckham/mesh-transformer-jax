 "context": "The following article called 'CEOs Most Optimistic on U.S. Profits in Bull Signal for S&P 500' was published on 2010-11-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMore U.S. executives than ever are\n increasing  earnings forecasts compared with those lowering them,\nhelped by almost $2 trillion of Federal Reserve spending and a\nrecovery in the global economy.  EBay Inc. , United Parcel Service Inc. and 196 other\ncompanies raised profit estimates above analysts\u2019 projections\nlast month as 130 firms cut them, the biggest gap since\nBloomberg began tracking the data in 1999. Shipping companies\nand computer makers boosted forecasts the most, pushing the\n Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index  of businesses most tied to the\neconomy up 27 percent since July 2. That beat the 20 percent\nrally in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  Companies are raising the outlook for U.S. profits at the\nsame time the Fed is trying to prevent deflation and reduce\nunemployment by purchasing an additional $600 billion in\nTreasuries. The last time executives were this optimistic,\nstocks climbed 39 percent over the next 3 1/2 years, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cIt\u2019s important for the rally and for the general health\nof the market that investors continue to anticipate higher\nearnings,\u201d said  Dean Gulis , who manages $3 billion for Loomis\nSayles & Co. in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. \u201cThat companies\nthemselves are expecting better profits is very positive. As we\nsee rising earnings, we\u2019ll see improving stock prices.\u201d  GDP Growth  About 1.5 U.S. companies  boosted  earnings estimates above\nanalysts\u2019 forecasts for each that  cut  projections in October.\nThat\u2019s about three times the average of 0.59 in the past 10\nyears, data tracked by Bloomberg show. The ratio fell to a\nrecord low of 0.1 in December 2008, three months after New York-\nbased Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. When\nit reached 1.1 in March 2004, the S&P 500 rose from 1,126.21 to\na record 1,565.15 in October 2007, Bloomberg data show.  The  S&P 500  has gained almost 201 points since falling to a\n10-month low on July 2 after companies from Baltimore-based T.\nRowe Price Group Inc. to  Google Inc.  in Mountain View,\nCalifornia, topped analysts\u2019 estimates and investors speculated\nthe Fed would act to boost growth. The benchmark measure of U.S.\nstocks rose 3.6 percent to 1,225.85 last  week , the fifth-\nstraight gain. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 1,223.25 at 4\np.m. in New York.  Earnings at  EBay , the owner of the second most-visited e-\ncommerce site, are getting a boost as consumers make more\npurchases online and use its PayPal service to handle money\ntransfers. The San Jose, California-based company forecast more\nfourth-quarter sales and earnings than analysts estimated on\nOct. 20, spurring the biggest gain in the shares in nine months.  Credit Expansion  Consumer  borrowing  in the U.S. unexpectedly increased in\nSeptember by the most in two years, led by a surge in non-\nrevolving credit such as college loans and auto financing, the\nFederal Reserve said on Nov. 5. The report was released the same\nday the Labor Department said employers added 151,000 jobs in\nOctober, more than twice the median economist prediction.  \u201cWe have outperformed our expectations through the first\nthree quarters of the year, and enter the holiday season with\nconfidence in our payments business,\u201d said  Bob Swan , EBay\u2019s\nchief financial officer, on a conference call following the\nearnings release. \u201cFrom a business standpoint, our global\nfootprint is expanding.\u201d  Rising international demand for everything from\ntransportation services to tobacco and power tools is helping\ndrive profits at companies such as UPS, Philip Morris\nInternational Inc. and Danaher Corp. While forecasts for U.S.\ngross domestic product in 2011 have fallen to 2.4 percent from\n2.9 percent in July, the biggest emerging markets are expected\nto expand at least twice as fast, based on economist estimates\nand International Monetary Fund forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Freight Traffic  UPS , the world\u2019s largest package-delivery company, raised\nits estimate for 2010 income on Oct. 21 and projected growth of\n51 percent to 53 percent for the year. That would be the biggest\nannual  earnings  increase for the Atlanta-based firm since before\n2000, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Freight-train  traffic  has risen 16 percent since July 9,\naccording to the Association of American Railroads. The index of\ncarloads at the largest U.S. lines plunged 31 percent from its\nhighest level in 2008 to May 2009, Bloomberg data show.  \u201cLooking towards peak season, customer sentiment is mixed,\nbut leaning towards cautious optimism,\u201d UPS CFO  Kurt Kuehn  told\ninvestors and analysts on Oct. 21. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting a good,\nstrong fourth quarter, and I\u2019m extremely confident we\u2019re on our\nway back to the high levels of profitability that we\u2019ve\ndemonstrated in the past.\u201d  Overseas Edge  Investors are betting profits at S&P 500 companies with the\nmost sales outside the U.S. will beat the market. Corporations\ngetting at least 50 percent of their revenue from foreign\nsources rose more than 10 percentage points more than American-\nfocused stocks since July 2.  Earnings for the 30 companies in the Morgan Stanley index\nof economically sensitive shares will grow 25 percent next year,\nalmost twice the rate of the S&P 500, according to analyst\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg. The cyclicals gauge trades for\n12.2 times estimated 2011 earnings, or 0.5 point lower than the\nS&P 500, Bloomberg data show.  Philip Morris  said on Oct. 21 that currency fluctuations,\nlower taxes and rising sales in countries from Algeria to\nIndonesia led the New York-based company to increase its 2010\nincome projection. The biggest publicly traded tobacco maker has\nadvanced 30 percent since July 2.  \u2018Strong\u2019 Momentum  \u201cWe have strong business momentum going into the fourth\nquarter and will benefit from higher margins in Japan as well as\nprice increases in Argentina, France, Indonesia, Italy, Poland,\nPortugal, Russia and the U.K.,\u201d said  Hermann Waldemer , the CFO,\nin a conference call. \u201cWe have market leadership and are\ngrowing volume and overall share in emerging markets.\u201d  Danaher  cited faster growth in emerging markets as one of\nthe reasons for increasing its 2010 profit forecast on Oct. 21\nto between $2.25 and $2.30 a share, the highest since at least\n1999, up from a range of $2.16 to $2.23. The Washington-based\nmaker of Craftsman tools said on Nov. 4 that it gets about 20\npercent of revenue from developing nations.  Increased regulation of the financial and health-care\nindustries is leading businesses to outsource computer services,\n Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.  said on Nov. 1. The\nTeaneck, New Jersey-based provider of data systems support\nraised its 2010 earnings forecast and beat analysts\u2019 third-\nquarter estimates. The shares are up 28 percent since July 2.  Cost Savings  \u201cClients continue to search for cost savings in order to\nfund growth and innovation in other areas,\u201d Chief Executive\nOfficer  Francisco D\u2019Souza  said on the call after the quarterly\nprofit report.  Stock prices have already risen to account for higher\ncorporate earnings and shares will require a strengthening\neconomy to climb more, said  Trym Riksen , chief investment\nofficer for the private-banking division of DnB NOR ASA. The\n valuation  for the companies in the S&P 500 has climbed to 15.3\ntimes reported profit from the past year, from a 14-month low of\n13.7 in July, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cThis huge wave of positive guidance has already been\npriced into the market,\u201d said Riksen, whose Oslo-based firm\noversees the equivalent of about $391 billion. \u201cIt would be\nvery surprising if that huge wave were to be prolonged.\u201d  Rising  raw-material prices  are reducing profitability for\nClorox Co., a maker of household-cleaning products, and apparel\ncompany Jones Group Inc. Earnings are being squeezed as\ncompanies struggle to pass costs onto shoppers at a time when\nyear-over-year gains in the consumer price index have averaged\n1.8 percent in 2010, compared with a 10-year average of 2.5\npercent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Record Cotton  Clorox  lowered its annual profit forecast on Nov. 2, citing\nweakening U.S. growth and higher commodity costs. Shares of the\nOakland, California-based company fell the most in almost two\nyears.  Jones Group  cut its 2010 sales projection on Oct. 27 amid\nsoaring cotton prices, which reached a record $1.446 a pound on\nNov. 5. Shares of the New York-based clothing maker are down 8.3\npercent this year.  Gains in U.S. GDP are trailing the average pace following a\ncontraction, according to data compiled by the National Bureau\nof Economic Research and Bloomberg. NBER said the worst\nrecession since the 1930s ended in June 2009, and Bloomberg data\nshow GDP growth will average 2.5 percent a quarter through June\n2011, or half the average rate in the two years following\ncontractions since 1949.  Longest Streak  Most companies are earning more than analysts expected.\nMore than  70 percent  in the S&P 500 beat profit forecasts in the\nJuly-to-September period for the sixth straight quarter, the\nlongest streak in Bloomberg data going back to 1993. S&P 500\n earnings  since Oct. 7 were 7 percent higher than analysts\npredicted, the data show.  Brazil, Russia, India and China, the biggest developing\nnations, are forecast to expand more than the U.S. next year.\nTheir growth will average 6.6 percent, according to the median\neconomist forecasts in a Bloomberg survey and IMF projections.  \u201cEarnings have been phenomenal out of corporate America,\u201d\n Robert Doll , who oversees $3.45 trillion as chief equity\nstrategist at New York-based BlackRock Inc., said in a Nov. 3\ninterview on Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cFirst Up\u201d with  Susan Li .\n\u201cThey\u2019ve delivered versus expectations, yet again outshining\nthe tepid economic recovery. I think that\u2019s the real story.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\n Lynn Thomasson  in Hong Kong at \n lthomasson@bloomberg.net ;\n Whitney Kisling  in New York at \n wkisling@bloomberg.net .
