 "context": "The following article called 'Soaring Target2 Imbalances Stoke German Risk Angst: Euro Credit' was published on 2012-03-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGerman angst is growing as an entry\non the  Bundesbank \u2019s balance sheet swells to a sum worth about 20\npercent of economic output, a sign of the extent to which\n Europe \u2019s largest economy is funding the region\u2019s laggards.  The  European Central Bank \u2019s Target2 system, which\ncalculates debts between the euro region\u2019s central banks, shows\nthe Bundesbank is owed 489 billion euros ($656 billion), up\nalmost 65 percent from a year earlier. German central bank\nPresident Jens Weidmann wrote to ECB President  Mario Draghi  last\nmonth to warn about growing systemic risks, Frankfurter\nAllgemeine Zeitung newspaper reported Feb. 29.  \u201cThe Germans are very much justified in their concern,\u201d\nsaid  John Whittaker , an economist at Lancaster University\nManagement School, who  drew attention  to the growing imbalances\nin papers published last year. \u201cThe Target2 liabilities are\njust as risky and just as real as holding the government bonds\nof Greece and other peripherals.\u201d  Investors demand a yield  premium  of about 3.28 percentage\npoints to hold  Spain \u2019s 10-year debt rather than Germany\u2019s, and\n3.15 percentage points to own  Italian (.10ITALY)  securities rather than\nbunds. Both levels are more than double their averages for the\npast five years.  Italy  had a Target2 deficit of 191 billion\neuros as of Dec. 30, while  Spain\u2019s  was 175 billion euros and\nIreland owed 80 billion euros, according to figures compiled by\ntheir central banks.  \u2018Dependent on Germany\u2019  \u201cThere would have been a current-account crisis years ago\nin a multi currency area,\u201d said Darren Williams, who helps\noversee about $420 billion as chief European economist at\nAllianceBernstein in London. \u201cThe periphery is dependent on\nGermany and the core to fund their consumption.\u201d  The Target2 system, named for the Trans-European Automated\nReal-Time Gross Settlement System, is part of the common\ncurrency\u2019s plumbing system to settle transactions.  A Greek importer, for example, might  place an order  with a\nGerman company. Payments to and from the accounts of the buyer\nand seller are channeled via central banks, so the German\nexporter\u2019s bank gets a credit with the Bundesbank, which in turn\nhas a claim on the ECB. The Greek importer\u2019s bank owes its local\ncentral bank, leaving the Bank of  Greece  with a debit at the\nECB.  Transactions across the 17-member euro region produce a net\nsurplus or deficit between countries at the ECB, and the system\ndepends on each country being able to meet its obligations. The\nless willing commercial banks are to deal with each other, the\nmore lopsided the balances between central banks become. The\nDutch central bank has claims on its peers of 153 billion euros,\nwhile Luxembourg is owed 110 billion euros, according to\nWhittaker.  To The Limit  \u201cThe Bundesbank effectively ends up with loans to the\nother national central banks that are reflected in the Target2\nclaims on the Eurosystem,\u201d said  Andrew Bosomworth , a managing\ndirector at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Munich. \u201cThe\n euro zone  is doing fiscal policy-like stuff through monetary\npolicy, but it\u2019s not going through the same democratic process.\nIt\u2019s not a good thing from a voter\u2019s perspective when you push\nit to the limit.\u201d  Greece, which had a Target2 deficit of 105 billion euros as\nof the end of November, last week carried out the biggest-ever\nsovereign debt restructuring, forcing private creditors to\nforego more than half of their principal.  Damaged Collateral  The bonds Greece is issuing in exchange for existing debt\nare worth less than 30 percent of face value, suggesting\ninvestors expect the nation to need another bailout. Bonds of\n Portugal  have yielded more than 12 percent every day bar one\nsince Nov. 24, even as the ECB continues to support the market\nby  buying the notes . The nation\u2019s 10-year borrowing cost is\ncurrently 13.83 percent, up from 12.77 percent on Feb. 24.  The Target2 system is underpinned by the collateral held by\nthe central banks, and its stability depends in part on how the\nvalue of those assets compares with how much has been borrowed\nagainst them.  Germany \u2019s Target2 position is now large enough to account\nfor half of its net investment abroad, according to Greg Fuzesi,\nan economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in London. He questions the\nvalue of some of the assets in use, citing government-guaranteed\nbonds that Italian banks issued to themselves and used to back\nborrowings through the ECB\u2019s three-year  longer term refinancing\noperations .  Collateral represents \u201ca real credit risk,\u201d according to\na research report by Guntram Wolff, deputy director of Bruegel,\na Brussels-based research institute. \u201cIf the risk materializes\nin the future, the Eurosystem will incur losses.\u201d  Only Connect  Using money borrowed from the ECB to repay bonds held by\nforeigners, may increase the imbalances, Fuzesi said. \u201cThe risk\nof the Eurosystem is very much a function of the collateral\nthat\u2019s been posted by the periphery and of the risk management\ntools applied to it by the central banks,\u201d he said.  Asymmetries in the system will correct as peripheral\neconomies again attract funds from core countries as bailouts,\nbank recapitalization and declining current-account imbalances\nrestore confidence. A break-up of the euro, however would\ncrystallize the risks, he said.  Target2 makes countries \u201cvery, very interlinked,\u201d Fuzesi\nsaid. \u201cEveryone has an interest in holding the system together.\nCertainly the Germans do.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJohn Glover in  London  at \n johnglover@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Mark Gilbert  at \n magilbert@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 30.81367301940918 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
