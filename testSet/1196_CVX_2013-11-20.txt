The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGroupe Saham, a Morocco-based\n investment company , bought GA Angola Seguros SA, Angola\u2019s\nlargest closely held insurance company by revenue, for an\nundisclosed amount, GA Chief Executive Officer Fernando Dolbeth\nAssuncao said.  Saham , founded in 1995 by Moulay Hafid Elalamy, operates 35\ninsurance companies in 19 countries across Africa and the Middle\nEast, including  Benin ,  Ivory Coast , Cameroon, Mali,  Gabon ,\n Senegal  and Togo. The deal \u201cwill significantly contribute to\nthe development of the Angolan insurance market,\u201d Assuncao said\nin a statement issued today.  The Angolan insurance market is valued at about $1 billion\na year in gross written premiums, with policies dominated by the\noil industry, according to a May report by Trevor Barsdorf, an\nanalyst at Johannesburg-based Global Credit Rating Co. The\ncountry is  Africa \u2019s largest crude producer after Nigeria.  GA\u2019s revenue was $161 million or about 16 percent of\nAngola\u2019s market last year, Chief Underwriter Shawn Kriedemann\nsaid in an e-mailed response to questions today.  The company has an A rating among the country\u2019s 13\ninsurance companies, Barsdorf said in the report. Saham\u2019s\nacquisition, similar to others it\u2019s done in Africa, shows how\nlarger insurance companies are seeking regional partners in\ncountries with attractive growth opportunities, he said in e-mailed response to questions.  \u201cThe corporate activity highlights a confidence expressed\nby external stakeholders regarding the Angolan insurance\nmarket,\u201d Barsdorf said. The deal \u201cultimately bodes well for\nthe underlying insurer as it could provide additional balance\nsheet capacity.\u201d  Client List  GA\u2019s client list includes  General Electric Co. (GE) ,  Chevron\nCorp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. energy company, Brazil\u2019s\nOdebrecht SA and diamond producer De Beers, according to a\ncompany presentation. With six branches staffed by 150\nemployees, it obtained its Angola operating license in 2005, the\nfirst private insurance company to enter the market in 30 years,\nthe company said.  Angola\u2019s largest insurer is the state-owned AAA, which has\nbenefited from strong business with state-owned oil company\nSonangol EP and has about 40 percent of the market, according to\nBarsdorf.  Empresa Nacional de Seguros e Resseguros de Angola, a\nstate-owned company also known as Ensa, controls about 37\npercent by focusing on government projects and aviation, he\nsaid.  One Alliance Insurance Services owned 70 percent of GA,\naccording to the company. The remaining 30 percent was held by\nan undisclosed Angolan partner.  Chairman Ivor Michael Alan Lewis began One Alliance in 1996\nto operate in Ghana and Mozambique before those operations were\nsold to Activa Group and Barclays/Absa Insurance, respectively.\nThe company has staff in  Angola  and is preparing to start\noperations in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
