The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n* Graphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv\nBy Jemima Kelly\nLONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Sterling strengthened on Thursday, recovering from losses earlier in the week, as concerns over Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s leadership eased and expectations grew that the Bank of England to take a more hawkish tone in its meeting next week.\nReports that May was facing a leadership challenge from members of her own party, as well as criticism from the House of Lords, which said in a report that her Brexit legislation plans contained \u201cfundamental flaws\u201d, weighed on the currency earlier in the week.\nBut the pound has been recovering since Tuesday, when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney struck an upbeat tone on the economy and said focus was turning to inflation, which investors thought might mean interest rate would rise faster. The central bank meets next Thursday.\n\u201cThere were a couple of things in there that suggested things were more optimistic,\u201d said ING currency strategist Viraj Patel, in London. \u201cHe (talked about) focus shifting back to curbing inflation, which suggested that maybe they\u2019re looking at a hike in 2018.\u201d\nPatel said sterling had also been able to recover because of the absence of bad news this week.\n\u201cDomestic political noise will act as a limiter for sterling, but it won\u2019t actively weigh on it. Once that noise doesn\u2019t escalate, or there\u2019s no new catalyst, the natural tendency is for the pound to just revert some of those losses,\u201d he said.\nA report that showed British manufacturing lost more momentum than expected last month, with activity falling to a seven-month low, took some shine off sterling but was not enough to knock it into negative territory.\nBy 1000 GMT the pound was trading up 0.4 percent up at $1.4244, having earlier reached $1.4275. Against the euro, it was up 0.1 percent at 87.36 pence.\nThe pound reached its highest levels on a trade-weighted basis since late June 2016 in the aftermath of the Brexit vote last week. It was just a half a percent off that high on Thursday.\nSince the EU referendum, sterling is still down around 9 percent on a trade-weighted basis, but it is up about 8 percent from a trough reached in October 2016.\n\u201cWith the currency having returned to more \u2018normal\u2019 levels recently, we foresee a slower pace of gains for the rest of 2018, mainly against the dollar, before the pound trade-weighted index trend appreciation re-accelerates in 2019,\u201d Credit Agricole strategists wrote in a note to clients.
