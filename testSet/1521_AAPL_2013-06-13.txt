 "context": "The following article called 'Apple Thinks, and Makes, Different' was published on 2013-06-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLet the geeks, and we use the term endearingly, argue over the changes  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  announced this week to its mobile operating system. Our focus is on something more prosaic: an  advertisement  -- and what that ad says about the state of U.S. manufacturing.  Apple\u2019s latest slick promotion touts the \u201cDesigned by Apple in  California \u201d line it includes on its devices (conveniently overlooking  the second line , \u201cAssembled in  China \u201d). At the end of the ad, a somber voice intones: \u201cThis is our signature. And it means everything.\u201d  What it means is that  Apple (AAPL)  is feeling pressure from U.S. politicians and labor activists over the tiny number of domestic jobs it provides, compared with the huge workforce Apple supports offshore. The pressure was evident last month, when Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook , on the hot seat over the small amount of  corporate tax  Apple pays, reminded a Senate subcommittee that the company is investing $100 million to make some of its Macintosh computers in the U.S.  It\u2019s not a huge amount of money for a company that earned $9.6 billion last quarter. Still, the operation, to be based in Texas, will be Apple\u2019s first domestic assembly foray since 2004, and other technology manufacturers are moving jobs onshore. Google Inc.\u2019s Motorola Mobility, for example, also plans to assemble smartphones in Texas.  It\u2019s not all public relations: These companies are taking advantage of low energy costs and a decade of wage stagnation, which has made U.S. factory jobs more competitive with those in China, where wages are rising. Even China\u2019s Lenovo Group Ltd. is starting to assemble  notebook computers  in  North Carolina .  Insourcing Movement  The insourcing movement has led to what some are calling an American manufacturing renaissance. This is an overstatement: Yes, manufacturing was responsible for the largest increase in economic value added (total output minus the value of intermediate products) in 2011 and 2012, according to the Labor Department. And since 2010, the U.S. has gained back some of the steep losses in manufacturing jobs. Yet the sector has lost 21,000 jobs since March. And the current employment of about 12 million people is a far cry from the peak of 17 million in 2000.  Getting back to that level will be tough, if not impossible. Apple\u2019s  Texas  initiative might result in 200 new jobs, by some estimates. What\u2019s more, the Apple, Lenovo and Motorola plants will only assemble devices, not build them from scratch. The components may even have to come from China, which pretty much controls the worldwide electronics supply chain.  But the sheer number of jobs isn\u2019t necessarily the best measure of success. More important, as Willy Shih, a Harvard Business School professor of management explains, is constant innovation, quality control and having engineers, production lines and suppliers in close proximity. The rush to low-cost China interrupted a lot of the progress U.S. companies had made -- and created new costs.  Inventing products is only a part of the value proposition. Taking an idea from the laboratory to the production line is equally important. The manufacturing process can give vital information to engineers, who in turn can use it to improve designs or manufacturing methods. All of this ultimately leads to greater efficiencies, fatter profits, faster economic growth -- and yes, better-paying jobs.  Insourcing can help speed this process along. Washington could reinforce the trend with a mix of pro-manufacturing policies, starting with taxes. By lowering the corporate income-tax rate from the current 35 percent -- one of the highest in the world -- Congress could stem the flow of jobs overseas. Lawmakers should also make permanent the research-and-development tax credit and liberalize trade with Europe and  Asia .  Meanwhile, Congress could fund President  Barack Obama \u2019s proposal to spend $1 billion on 15 institutes, modeled on a German program, to develop and showcase new manufacturing technologies. Community colleges can play  a valuable role  by offering the specialized job training that high-tech manufacturers require.  Soon Apple will be able to put an \u201cAssembled in the U.S.\u201d label on some of its computers. If Congress and the White House can deliver on the other policies, it might not be long before that label says, \u201cMade in the U.S.\u201d  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:  view@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 13.517960548400879 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
