The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanada\u2019s wireless industry needs\nmore foreign capital to support emerging challengers to the\ncountry\u2019s established carriers, Industry Minister Christian Paradis said.  \u201cWhat we want is to have more competition,\u201d Paradis said\nyesterday when asked if he would prefer a foreign-backed company\nor a domestic carrier buying Wind Mobile, the largest recent\nentrant to the Canadian industry.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the Amsterdam-\nbased owner of Wind Mobile, is soliciting bids for the company,\naccording to Canaccord Genuity analyst  Dvai Ghose .  \u201cWe need foreign capital,\u201d Paradis, 39, said during an\ninterview in his office near Parliament in Ottawa. For the\nsmaller players, \u201ccapitalization is a life and death matter.\u201d  The government is looking at ways to help four new wireless\nproviders, which also include Videotron Ltd., Public Mobile Inc.\nand Mobilicity. The smaller firms are challenging  Rogers\nCommunications Inc. (RCI/B) ,  BCE Inc. (BCE)  and  Telus Corp. (T) , which together\ncontrol more than 90 percent of the market by subscribers.  VimpelCom, whose acquisition of Wind Mobile is pending\napproval by Canadian regulators, intends to sell the company and\nhas begun collecting bids, Toronto-based Ghose said in a\nresearch note last week.  Anthony Lacavera , the founder of Wind\nMobile, is teaming up with his original backer Naguib Sawiris\nand his investment firm Accelero Capital to submit a bid, the\nGlobe and Mail  reported .  Auction Rules  Alexandra Maxwell, a spokeswoman for Wind Mobile, declined\nto comment, as did VimpelCom spokesman  Bobby Leach .  Paradis laid down new rules on March 7 designed to foster\ncompetition by preventing the biggest three companies from each\nbuying more than one of four blocks of 700-megahertz airwaves in\na wireless spectrum auction this year.  The format for the auction will ensure there are at least\nfour wireless providers in each region of the country, Paradis\nsaid at the time. The government is determined to see that\nvision realized, he said in the interview yesterday.  \u201cWe have to continue to push,\u201d Paradis said. \u201cWe have a\nless intrusive way for now in the market, but we are committed\nto go this way.\u201d  Paradis said it\u2019s \u201chard to speculate\u201d how the government\nwould respond to a bid for  BlackBerry (BB) , formerly known as\n Research in Motion Ltd .  \u201cThis is an aggressive market; you never know what can\nhappen,\u201d Paradis said. \u201cWhen you have a national champion like\nBlackBerry, you hope they remain a national champion.\u201d  Target BlackBerry  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the Beijing-based computer maker, said\nin January it was assessing potential targets and strategic\nalliances and was looking at BlackBerry. Lenovo\u2019s Chief\nFinancial Officer Wong Mai Wing told Bloomberg in an interview\n\u201cwe are looking at all opportunities -- RIM and many others.\u201d  Acquiring BlackBerry would require approval from Canadian\nand U.S. regulators because of the size of the transaction and\nthe fact the company operates secure mobile networks for\ngovernment agencies. Canada automatically reviews foreign\ntakeovers of companies with asset values of more than C$344\nmillion ($338 million) to determine whether the transactions are\na \u201cnet benefit\u201d to the country.  Chinese ownership of BlackBerry would also raise security\nquestions. The company has been wary of widening its operations\nin  China  over concerns about protecting its sensitive networks,\nChief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins told shareholders in\nJuly.
