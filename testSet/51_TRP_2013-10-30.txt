 "context": "The following article called 'Keystone XL Review Hijacked by Activists TransCanada Says' was published on 2013-10-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTransCanada Corp. (TRP)  chief executive\n Russ Girling  acknowledged that opponents of the Keystone XL\npipeline have slowed its approval, though he said his company\nremains committed to the project.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the noise outside is having an\ninfluence on the process,\u201d he said today, in an interview in\n Washington . \u201cThe project has been hijacked by activists that\nare opposed to the development of all fossil fuels.\u201d  Girling, who met with State Department officials about the\nproject yesterday, expressed frustration with the five-year\nreview by U.S. regulators, saying the process for evaluating\ncross-border energy projects must change. He said he has stopped\ngiving the company\u2019s investors an estimate of when the approval\nprocess will be complete.  \u201cI think we have exhausted everything that could possibly\nbe asked,\u201d he said.  Still, he said TransCanada, which is based in Calgary,\nwould continue pushing to build the $5.3 billion link between\n Alberta \u2019s oil sands and refineries along the  Gulf Coast , even if\nPresident  Barack Obama  eventually decides against approving the\nroute. He did not elaborate on what steps the company would take\nif the project is rejected.  \u201cNobody is going to pack up their tent and leave,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cWe will get through these hurdles. The marketplace will\ndetermine whether these projects get done.\u201d  Carbon Pollution  Obama made his last public comments about Keystone in June,\nsaying he would approve the remaining portion of the pipeline\nonly if it would not \u201csignificantly exacerbate the problem of\ncarbon pollution.\u201d  Many environmentalists, including some of the president\u2019s\nbiggest financial donors, have turned the project into a litmus\ntest on environmental issues. The decision, they argue, will set\nthe parameters of the energy debate for years to come and\ndetermine Obama\u2019s legacy on  climate change .  Even so, Girling said he viewed the president\u2019s comments as\n\u201cpositive,\u201d saying that the pipeline would not increase oil\nconsumption and would displace carbon-intensive heavy crude from\n Venezuela  or elsewhere.  \u201cThe pipeline itself has no emissions and there\u2019s no way\nthat building it will cause an increase in consumption,\u201d he\nsaid.  Accelerate Development  Keystone critics have been \u201cvery successful in creating the\nimpression that the pipeline equals emissions, which is what\nthis is all about,\u201d Girling said. He likened the argument to\n\u201csuggesting that if we stop building roads people will stop\ndriving. They will just drive on bad roads.\u201d  Opponents argue that the pipeline would increase  carbon\nemissions  by accelerating the pace of oil sands development,\nwhich releases more greenhouse gas emissions than the production\nand refining of more conventional types of crude.  \u201c Tar sands  are the dirtiest fuel source of oil, and\nGirling knows that investors will flock to Alberta if Keystone\nis approved,\u201d said Daniel Kessler, a spokesman for 350.org, an\nenvironmental group that has led much of the opposition to the\nline. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just about this pipeline but instead a\nlarger signal that the tar sands are open for business if\nKeystone is approved.\u201d  Previous pipelines built by the company took about two\nyears to be approved by U.S. authorities. The longer regulators\ndelay a decision on Keystone, said Girling, the more costs mount\nfor TransCanada.  $2 Billion  The company has $2 billion invested in the project already,\nhe said. Unused pumps sitting in warehouses and pipes laying on\nthe ground need to be maintained and labor agreements and\nconstruction contracts are coming due for renegotiation.  \u201cWe have a very expensive and complicated process of\ntrying to manage a construction project that should have\nfinished by now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole value chain that\u2019s\ninvolved.\u201d  The lower leg of the line from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to the\nGulf Coast, which TransCanada started building earlier because\nit didn\u2019t require a presidential permit, is 85 percent complete\nand on track to start transporting crude at the end of this\nyear, the company said. A lateral pipeline to Houston is\nforecast to be online in 2014.  Harold Hamm , the chief executive of  Continental Resources\nInc. (CLR) , has said the northern leg of Keystone that\u2019s now under\nreview is no longer needed with rail making up for a lack of\npipelines to carry oil from the Bakken Field in  North Dakota  to\nmarkets to the east, west and south.  Asia Exports  Canadian oil producers should focus on exporting the\nbitumen to  Asia  and elsewhere as domestic producers negate the\nneed for oil in the U.S., Hamm said at a Bloomberg energy\nconference in Houston earlier this month.  The Oklahoma City-based Continental is the biggest owner of\ndrilling leases in the Bakken, and competes with  Canada \u2019s oil\nsands producers among U.S. refiners.  Keystone would have the capacity to deliver 830,000 barrels\nof crude a day, including 100,000 barrels reserved for U.S.\nproducers. Girling said  oil companies  operating in the U.S.\nremain committed to the project, including Continental.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any of our shippers drop their contracts\non our project,\u201d Girling said. \u201cIn fact, we have folks that\nstill want to get on the pipeline. What you are hearing from\nproducers is we have to get on with our lives.\u201d  Girling said there \u201cwasn\u2019t anything of material\nsignificance\u201d discussed during his meeting with State\nDepartment yesterday. The agency has jurisdiction because the\nproject would cross an international border.  The company would try to address any concerns that may\narise, including safety improvements to reduce the risks of\nspills, he said.  \u201cWe have no issue with adding additional features that\nwould allow us to be as safe as we possibly can,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat is our primary objective.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nLisa Lerer in Washington at \n llerer@bloomberg.net ;\nJim Snyder in Washington at \n jsnyder24@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nJon Morgan at \n jmorgan97@bloomberg.net ;\nSteven Komarow at \n skomarow1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of TransCanada Corporation was 30.975887298583984 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of TransCanada Corporation was ",
