 "context": "The following article called 'Nasdaq First-Quarter Profit Beats Estimates on Technology' was published on 2013-04-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , the second-\nlargest U.S. stock exchange, reported first-quarter profit that\nexceeded analysts\u2019 estimates as revenue from information\nservices and technology increased.  Earnings excluding some items increased to 64 cents a share\nin the three months ended March 31 from 61 cents a year ago, the\nNew York-based company said in a statement today. That beat the\n62-cent average forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The\ncompany said it may pay $10 million to resolve a Securities and\nExchange Commission investigation into the mishandling of\n Facebook  Inc.\u2019s initial public offering.  Costs from the botched IPO weighed on first-quarter profits\nat a time when Chief Executive Officer Robert Greifeld is\ndiversifying the business to offset a global decline in stock\ntrading. In the last few months the exchange has bought eSpeed,\nan electronic platform for trading U.S. Treasury bonds, the\nshareholder-relations unit of Thomson Reuters Corp. and a 25\npercent stake in TOM, a Dutch alternative trading system focused\non options.  \u201cWhile the volume environment remained challenging, our\nportfolio of corporate, trading, technology and information\nbusinesses continue to deliver consistent revenue and earnings\nperformance,\u201d Greifeld said in the statement. \u201cWe are\nconfident that a recovering economy and increasing investor\nconfidence will eventually lead to stronger tailwinds for our\nbusinesses.\u201d  Facebook Costs  Charges related to the Facebook IPO led to a 51 percent\ndrop in first-quarter net income, to $42 million, or 25 cents a\nshare, from $85 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier.\nThe profit figure includes the $10 million set aside for the SEC\nprobe as well as the $62 million regulators have cleared as\n Nasdaq \u2019s plan to compensate brokers for the Facebook debut.  Nasdaq shares slipped 2.8 percent to $27.67 at 1:50 p.m.\nNew York time, headed for the lowest close since Jan. 24.  The $62 million compensation pool will go to traders who\nlost money after a design flaw in the exchange\u2019s computers\ndelayed Facebook\u2019s open and left them confused about how many\nshares they owned. Computer systems used to establish Facebook\u2019s\nopening price on May 18 were overwhelmed by order cancellations\nand updates during the \u201cbiggest IPO cross in the history of\nmankind,\u201d Greifeld said two days after the offering.  Greifeld received 18 percent more in compensation for 2012\neven as his bonus was reduced due to the  Facebook IPO .  Core Expenses  For the full year, Nasdaq forecast core operating expenses\nin the range of $910 million to $930 million. In addition,\nNasdaq expects $50 million to $60 million for \u201cnew initiative\nspending\u201d and $12 million related to a 2013 accounting\nreclassification of certain Corporate Solutions expenses.  Average daily volume  for equities listed on all U.S.\nexchanges was 6.35 billion shares in the first quarter, 6.8\npercent down from a year earlier, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg.  \u201cThere will be a beta return, a cyclical return to equity\nvolumes,\u201d Greifeld said on a call with analysts today. \u201cWe\u2019ll\nbe the beneficiary of that, and we\u2019ll enjoy that, but clearly,\nour job is to not sit around and wait for that. It\u2019s to make\nsure that we\u2019re building our business independent of the volume\nenvironment.\u201d  Nasdaq OMX\u2019s biggest rival,  NYSE Euronext (NYX) , agreed in\nDecember to be acquired by futures bourse\nIntercontinentalExchange Inc. for $8 billion in a move that\nunderscored the growing importance of derivatives in the face of\nshrinking volume worldwide.  \u2018Strategic Acquisitions\u2019  Nasdaq, which has a program called GIFT to fund projects\nsuch as the new derivatives market in  London , said it will also\nseek \u201cstrategic acquisitions.\u201d  Revenue from the market services unit, accounting for 43\npercent of net exchange revenue, fell to $182 million in the\nfirst quarter from $190 million a year ago. The unit includes\ncash equities, where volume is declining, derivatives and access\nand broker services.  The information services division, accounting for 26\npercent of revenue, took in $108 million during the quarter, up\nfrom $102 million, the exchange said. The unit covers market\ndata and index licensing.  The technology solutions unit, which comprises 18 percent\nof revenue, generated $73 million in the first quarter, compared\nwith $66 million a year ago.
