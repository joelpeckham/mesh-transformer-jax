 "context": "The following article called 'Junk Dim Sum Added by UOB as Pimco Wary of Rally' was published on 2013-03-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA junk Dim Sum bond rally that\ndrove yields to an 18-month low is prompting caution among funds\nwith UOB Asset Management Ltd. preferring shorter-dated notes\nand Pacific Investment Management Co. wary of high debt loads.  The average yield on these yuan-denominated securities\ntouched 4.95 percent yesterday, the least since September 2011,\naccording to an index compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc. That\u2019s 162\nbasis points, or 1.62 percentage points, more than investment-\ngrade notes, the smallest spread since February 2011.\nSpeculative-grade debt yields 5.93 percent in the U.S. and 6.61\npercent in Asia, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  Global investors are piling into  yuan  bonds maturing in\nless than five years on expectations the currency will\nstrengthen as China\u2019s economy expands, while avoiding longer-\ndated debt that is most at risk from rising interest rates,\naccording to UOB Asset. Russian Standard Bank ZAO sold 500\nmillion yuan ($80 million) of two-year notes at an 8 percent\nyield on Jan. 31, while the rate on  New World China Land Ltd. (917) \u2019s\nyuan securities due 2015 has dropped to 4.41 percent from 8.5\npercent since they were sold almost a year ago.  \u201cWe have purchased all the three high-yield CNH issues so\nfar in 2013,\u201d said Chia Tse Chern, the Singapore-based head of\nAsia fixed income at UOB Asset, referring to the yuan offshore\nby its three-letter identifier. \u201cWe like the short-duration\nnature of these high-yield CNH bonds and we believe that the\nlimited supply should potentially support the bond prices in the\nsecondary market.\u201d  Supply Limited  The assets of  UOB United Renminbi Bond Fund (UOBURBS)  that Chia\nmanages rose to S$56.8 million ($45.5 million) on March 4 from\nS$22.77 million at end-2012, according to data provided by UOB\nAsset Management.  Consumer prices in the world\u2019s second-largest economy\nclimbed 3.2 percent from a year earlier in February following a\n2 percent increase the previous month, official data showed\nMarch 9. The figures were distorted by changes in the timing of\nthe weeklong Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February this\nyear and January in 2012.  The supply of high-yield Dim Sum debt is limited as a\nstrengthening yuan and relatively low interest rates in the U.S.\nencourage companies to tap the dollar bond market for funds. The\nyuan will advance 2.1 percent to 6.10 per dollar in 2013,\naccording to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  China \u2019s\n10-year sovereign note  yields  3.59 percent, compared with 2.07\npercent for similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries.  Standard Chartered Plc. is boosting its holdings of\nshorter-dated offshore yuan bonds on the prospect of currency\ngains, according to its Singapore-based chief investment\nstrategist Steve Brice.  Pimco Concerned  Chinese and Hong Kong companies have sold a combined $15.3\nbillion of dollar debt so far this year, a record for the period,\ndata compiled by Bloomberg show. There were 33 new high-yield\nissues in the Asia dollar bond market totaling $13.1 billion\nthis year, compared with three in the Dim Sum bond market that\nraised $720 million, according to UOB\u2019s Chia.  \u201cHigh-yield companies prefer to issue in the U.S. dollar\nmarket where they can issue in larger sizes and longer tenor,\u201d\nChia said. \u201cWe think that the volume of high-yield Dim Sum\nissuance is likely to be limited.\u201d  High-yield or junk debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard & Poor\u2019s.  Pimco, the manager of the world\u2019s biggest bond fund, is\nconcerned about the quality of companies selling these yuan-\ndenominated bonds in Hong Kong, according to Raja Mukherji, who\nis based in the city and is head of Asian credit research.  More Issues  \u201cMany issuers are coming to market without a deep track\nrecord or management credibility, are much less diversified, and\nare highly leveraged,\u201d Mukherji wrote in a March 6 e-mail.\n\u201cPimco is carefully observing the Dim Sum market and will\nanalyze investment opportunities based on the above key\nfactors.\u201d  Far East Horizon Ltd. (3360) , a financial services provider that\nissued 1 billion yuan of Dim Sum notes at 5.75 percent in\nJanuary, had long-term debt equivalent to 129 percent of its\nequity, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There are \u201ca number of companies\u201d in preparations for Dim\nSum bond sales, which will return the demand and supply balance\nin the offshore market to a more normal level, Citic Securities\nCo. wrote in a report yesterday, without identifying the names\nof potential issuers. ABC International Holdings Ltd., a unit of\nBeijing-based Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., said last month\nit plans to hire more traders for yuan bonds in Hong Kong as a\ngrowing number of state-owned companies tap the market.  Yuan Demand  The yuan rose 0.02 percent to 6.2167 per dollar as of 11:20\na.m. in  Shanghai , while the twelve-month non-deliverable\nforwards gained 0.05 percent to 6.3066 in Hong Kong. The  cost  of\ninsuring China\u2019s sovereign notes using five-year credit-default\nswaps fell four basis points to 62 in New York since the end of\nDecember, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by\nMcGraw-Hill Cos. The contracts pay the buyer face value in\nexchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if\na borrower defaults.  There are signs that global demand for yuan-denominated\nassets is strengthening. The People\u2019s Bank of China and domestic\nfinancial institutions sold a record 683.7 billion yuan to buy\nforeign exchange in January, official  data  show. The amount of\nyuan held outside China totals almost 900 billion yuan and the\ncurrency is expected to be fully convertible in five years, HSBC\neconomists led by  Qu Hongbin  wrote in a research note received\nyesterday.  The average yield on non-rated Dim Sum debt has fallen 85\nbasis points to 4.95 percent in the past year, according to the\nHSBC Offshore  Renminbi  Bond Index. The rate on investment-grade\nnotes dropped 20 basis points to 3.33 percent.  \u201cWe have seen better flows into offshore yuan credits both\nin primary allocation and secondary trading,\u201d HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong-\nbased analysts Crystal Zhao and Zhang Zhiming wrote in a\nresearch note on March 7. \u201cWe remain constructive on the high-\nyield space as investors continue to search for yield.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nFion Li in Hong Kong at \n fli59@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJames Regan at \n jregan19@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 34.460479736328125 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
