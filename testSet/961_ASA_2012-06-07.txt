 "context": "The following article called 'Bangladesh to Tax Mobile-Phone Bills to Help Cap Budget Deficit' was published on 2012-06-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBangladesh  plans to tax mobile-phone\nbills to help fund a subsidy program spanning fuel to food as it\nstrives to prevent the nation\u2019s fiscal deficit from widening\npast a four-year high.  The government estimates the fiscal shortfall will be 5\npercent of gross domestic product in the year through June 30,\n2013, the same level as in 2011-2012, Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said in his budget speech to parliament in Dhaka\nyesterday. The South Asian nation, one of the poorest in the\nworld, intends to levy a 2 percent tax on mobile phone bills,\nbudget documents showed.  Muhith projected 7.2 percent economic expansion next year\neven as a backdrop of feuding between the government and\nopposition over the disappearances of activists underscores the\nthreat of political instability. Such risks, and the toll on\nBangladesh\u2019s pivotal garment exports from  Europe \u2019s debt crisis,\nmay erode investor confidence in the nation\u2019s economic outlook.  \u201cIt would be a serious mistake if the budget doesn\u2019t\naddress the macroeconomic imbalances in the economy,\u201d Ahsan H.\nMansur, executive director of the Dhaka-based Policy Research\nInstitute, said before the speech. Fiscal and monetary policies\nsince December 2011 have sought to contain domestic demand to\ncurb imports, damp inflation and stabilize the nation\u2019s currency,\nand the budget needs to continue that process, he said.  The  International Monetary Fund  approved a $987 million\nloan for Bangladesh in April after oil purchases and the impact\non exports of Europe\u2019s turmoil depleted foreign reserves. The\nEuropean Union and the U.S. are the largest markets for the\ncountry\u2019s overseas sales.  Currency Slide  The taka has slumped 11.4 percent in the past year and was\nlittle changed at 82.175 per dollar yesterday. The Dhaka Stock\nExchange\u2019s General Index, which has  tumbled  almost 20 percent\nover the same period, fell 0.5 percent.  The projected 2012-2013 deficit and the estimated shortfall\nfor the current year are the highest since the 5.4 percent\nrecorded in 2007-2008, figures from Bangladesh Bank show.  \u201cThe growing central government deficit and its\nmonetization and domestic financing are exerting pressure on\nmacroeconomic imbalances,\u201d the World Bank said in a  report  in\nMay. Officials need to contain  government borrowing  to ensure\nbusinesses can access sufficient credit, it said.  The IMF has said the conditions on its loan include a\nrestrained monetary policy, reduced trade barriers and moderate\nfiscal consolidation.  Bangladesh Bank has raised its benchmark repurchase rate by\na total of 325 basis points to 7.75 percent since August 2010.\nInflation moderated to 9.15 percent in May from 9.93 percent in\nApril. Muhith said it may ease to 7.5 percent next fiscal year.  Mobile-Phone Tax  The tax on mobile-phone bills \u201cwill further punish the\nmobile industry,\u201d said Abu Saeed Khan, secretary general of the\nAssociation of Mobile Telecom Operators of Bangladesh.  The nation had almost  91 million  mobile subscribers at the\nend of April, according to the Bangladesh Telecommunication\nRegulatory Authority. Providers include Grameenphone Ltd., a\nunit of Telenor ASA. Grameenphone phone fell 0.1 percent to\n206.9 taka yesterday.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed is seeking to lure\nforeign investors to add  power plants , roads and ports.\nExpansion may slow to 6.3 percent in the 12 months to June 30\n2012 from 6.7 percent the previous year, according to\nprovisional data from  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics .  Aside from garment exports, the $106 billion economy is\nalso dependent on money sent home by Bangladeshis working\noverseas. Remittances rose 15 percent in May from a year earlier\nto $1.15 billion.  A history of political instability and corruption are among\nobstacles to the goal of faster development.  Thirteen people, mostly activists, have disappeared in the\nfive months through May, according to a report by  Odhikar , a\nnon-governmental organization that says it documents human\nrights violations. Seventy-two journalists were injured in\nattacks in the same period, it said.  Political volatility is detrimental to investor confidence,\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service said in April. More than 75 percent of\nBangladesh\u2019s population still lives on less than $2 per day,\naccording to  World Bank  data.
