 "context": "The following article called 'HP-Oracle Itanium Contract Trial Resumes After Talks Fail' was published on 2012-06-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  and Oracle Corp.\nfailed to reach a settlement during a two-day pause in a trial\nover claims the database maker broke a contract by discontinuing\nsoftware for some Hewlett-Packard servers, a person familiar \nwith the matter said.  The trial, which started June 4 in state court in  San Jose ,\nCalifornia, resumed today after it was put on hold for the last\ntwo days at the request of both companies, Rowena Walker, a\ncourt clerk, said in an e-mail.  Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg, who is overseeing the\ntrial, last week encouraged the companies to work with another\njudge, Brian Walsh, who had presided over a mandatory settlement\nconference on May 22 that failed, said the person, who didn\u2019t\nwant to be identified because the talks were confidential.  The latest negotiations failed as well, the person said\ntoday.  In its 2011 complaint, Hewlett-Packard, the world\u2019s largest\npersonal-computer maker, accused Oracle of violating a portion\nof former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer  Mark Hurd \u2019s\nseparation agreement describing a \u201creaffirmation of the Oracle-\nHP partnership.\u201d One month after Hurd\u2019s forced resignation in\n2010, he was hired by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison to serve as co-\npresident of the largest database-software maker.  Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, California, seeks a\ncourt order requiring Oracle to continue developing software for\nits servers running on  Intel Corp. (INTC) \u2019s Itanium chips, and about\n$500 million in damages.  Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, denies Hewlett-\nPackard\u2019s claims, arguing that the two sentences at issue in the\nagreement don\u2019t require Oracle to forfeit what software it can\ndevelop and what price it can charge.  Howard Clabo, a Hewlett-Packard spokesman, declined to\ncomment on the trial delay.  Deborah Hellinger , an Oracle\nspokeswoman, also declined to comment.  The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. v.  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , 11-\ncv-203163, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County (San\nJose).
