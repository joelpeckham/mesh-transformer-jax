 "context": "The following article called 'Russian Recession Risk Worsened as Banks Skimp on Loans' was published on 2013-08-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nElena Dibova was ready to pledge her\n15 million-ruble ($456,000) apartment to get financing for her\nmetal-safe business. As her bank dragged its feet, she hit the\nroadblock companies across  Russia  face as the economy sinks.  Corporate-lending growth has plunged as the weaker economy\nprompts banks to demand more collateral and as borrowers shun\ninterest rates that can top 20 percent. As  VTB24 , the retail arm\nof Russia\u2019s second-largest lender, expanded its list of demands,\nDibova borrowed 2.5 million rubles from her business partners so\nshe could join a tender to supply the Moscow police.  \u201cI\u2019d have an entirely different strategy for developing my\nbusiness if money was easily accessible,\u201d said Dibova, 48, who\nalso halted investments and canceled a holiday after giving up\non her bank. \u201cI\u2019d have expanded or would have built something,\nbut it\u2019s impossible with loans costing so much.\u201d  President  Vladimir Putin  is seeking ways to shore up the\neconomy as corporate credit dries up amid policy makers\u2019\nreluctance to cut interest rates in the face of above-target\ninflation. The economy grew 1.2 percent from a year earlier in\nthe second quarter, the slowest pace since 2009, as investment\nshriveled. That may mean Russia has entered its second recession\nin five years, according London-based to Capital Economics Ltd.  Reduced Access  \u201cCorporate lending has been decelerating for the last six\nto nine months,\u201d  Ivan Tchakarov , chief economist at  Renaissance\nCapital , said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for companies\nthat aren\u2019t big, quasi-sovereign companies to access credit.\u201d  Loans to companies increased 12 percent from a year earlier\nin June compared with 24 percent in the same month of 2012,\ncentral bank data show. The average weighted interest rate on\nloans to smaller companies is between 15 percent and 17 percent,\naccording to SME Bank, a unit of state development bank\nVnesheconombank, or VEB, that focuses on such clients.  By contrast, state-run telecommunications company OAO\nRostelecom agreed this month to borrow 5 billion rubles at 7.8\npercent from OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) , a unit of Societe Generale SA.  Russia, the biggest emerging economy to raise borrowing\ncosts last year, left its benchmark rate unchanged at 8.25\npercent, for an 11th month Aug. 9, with inflation exceeding its\n6 percent goal for an 11th month in July. Oleg Deripaska, the\nbillionaire owner of  United Co Rusal Plc (486) , the world\u2019s biggest\naluminum producer, has said policy makers \u201csucked all blood\nfrom the Russian economy\u201d by refraining from rate cuts.  \u2018Too High\u2019  \u201cRates are too high and under those conditions our\nindustry isn\u2019t competitive,\u201d Deripaska said in a June interview\nwith state television channel Rossiya 24. \u201cWe have to compete\nwith producers in  Germany ,  Korea , America when their rates are\ntwice or three times lower.\u201d  The downturn in the world\u2019s largest energy exporter is\nthreatening to undermine the consensus that\u2019s underpinned\nPutin\u2019s 13-year rule, which has been challenged by the largest\nprotests of that period in recent years.  As Putin flagged \u201calarming signals\u201d of an economic\nslowdown, Russian asset prices have tumbled. The benchmark RTS\n stock index  has dropped almost 14 percent this year compared\nwith an 11 percent decline for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.\nThe yield on 10-year government debt has risen to 7.42 percent\nfrom 6.9 percent at end-2012 as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman\n Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may scale back bond\npurchases.  Currency Losses  The ruble was 0.1 percent weaker at 32.9480 per dollar at\n5:39 p.m. in Moscow, having retreated 9.3 percent against the\nU.S. currency since reaching a 12-month peak on Feb. 1.  The plight of smaller businesses hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by\nthe president, who pledged last year to raise their share of\noverall employment to at least half from 9 percent at present.  Putin called an emergency meeting in April with cabinet\nmembers to find ways to revive growth. Three months later, the\ngovernment unveiled measures to bring down borrowing costs,\nincluding tapping one of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth funds for\nsmall-business lending and insuring loans issued by banks.  \u201cThis sector of the economy has the lowest access to\nfunding,\u201d central bank Chairman  Elvira Nabiullina  said in June.\n\u201cIt\u2019s necessary first of all to take measures to cut borrowing\ncosts for small and medium-sized business.\u201d  In the meantime, the souring economic backdrop is making\nbanks less keen to lend to smaller companies, according to\nDmitry Polevoy, an economist at  ING Groep NV (INGA)  in Moscow.  SMEs Squeezed  \u201cBecause of the slowdown, there\u2019s been a decline in\ncorporate profits, meaning corporates\u2019 financial positions have\ndeteriorated,\u201d he said by phone. \u201cBanks reacted to this by\nraising some requirements for new loans, especially for small\nand medium-sized enterprises that have less valuable and higher\nrisk collateral than the big companies.\u201d  That\u2019s a phenomenon Mikhail Koltunov\u2019s all too familiar\nwith. The 31-year-old entrepreneur had to pledge his Kia car as\nwell as his father\u2019s Hyundai and his business partner\u2019s Skoda to\nget a 5 million-ruble loan to buy a new office for his printing\ncompany in Rostov-on-Don in southern Russia.  The collateral allowed him to secure an  interest rate  of 14\npercent from his hometown bank,  Center-Invest , cheaper than the\n18 percent to 19 percent he\u2019s paying the country\u2019s biggest\nlender, OAO Sberbank, for 2 million rubles of unsecured loans\nand 21 percent he\u2019s paying to borrow 800,000 rubles from VTB24.  Lenders need to offer terms that allow companies to prosper\nand make healthy profits, according to Koltunov, who employs\neight people. \u201cBut banks don\u2019t trust small businesses.\u201d  Back in Moscow, high loan rates have curbed the enthusiasm\nfor enterprise that Dibova had when she started her safe-making\ncompany 22 years ago.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a business any longer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will\njust see me through to retirement.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAgnes Lovasz in London at \n alovasz@bloomberg.net ;\nOlga Tanas in Moscow at \n otanas@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was 8.450551986694336 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was ",
