 "context": "The following article called 'Microsoft Surface a Dual-Personality PC: Rich Jaroslovsky' was published on 2012-10-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIs Microsoft\u2019s new Surface your next\niPad, or is it your next personal computer?  It isn\u2019t an idle question. The company is touting the\n Surface , its shiny new tablet-PC hybrid, as something of an\niPad-killer. After a week of using it, I\u2019m not so sure. But it\nmay just be the slickest laptop I\u2019ve used in a very long time.  Technically, the Surface isn\u2019t a PC at all, since it\ndoesn\u2019t run on the  Intel (INTC)  microprocessors that are the industry\nstandard. Instead, it uses an  Nvidia (NVDA)  chip of the kind commonly\nfound in tablets and wireless phones, and its operating system\nis a variant of Microsoft\u2019s new Windows 8 called Windows RT.  To many users, though, that may be a distinction without a\ndifference. The Surface, which goes on sale Oct. 26, is\npreloaded with new versions of  Microsoft (MSFT)  Word, Excel, PowerPoint\nand Internet Explorer and has a desktop mode that feels a lot\nlike traditional Windows. Outfitted with one of Microsoft\u2019s\nsnazzy new $120 keyboard covers, and perhaps a USB thumb drive\nto expand the storage, it becomes a powerful, lightweight\nproductivity tool.  The Surface starts at $499 for a Wi-Fi-only model with 32\ngigabytes of storage. In theory, that\u2019s $100 cheaper than a\ncomparable iPad. But only in theory.  For one thing, not all that space is accessible to the\nuser; only 44 GB of my 64 GB test model was actually available\nfor my own stuff.  Expensive Accessories  Moreover, the accessories needed to use it as a PC are\nexpensive and available only from Microsoft: that colorful cover\nthat doubles as a flat, pressure-sensitive keyboard, or -- my\nfavorite -- a $130 model with actual keys. (A bundle with a\nblack flat keyboard is $599 for 32 GB, $699 for 64 GB.)  There are a few big differences between the Surface and the\nflood of new Windows 8 PCs hitting the market. One is the\nlimited storage; the other is the absence of Outlook,\nMicrosoft\u2019s e-mail and calendar client.  The biggest difference, though, is that it can\u2019t run\nexisting software written for previous versions of Windows, like\n Adobe (ADBE) \u2019s Photoshop or  Intuit (INTU) \u2019s QuickBooks. (A costlier Surface\nthat will run Windows 8, use Intel chips and handle legacy\nsoftware is due early next year.)  The Surface\u2019s split personality is evident as soon as you\npull it out of the box. It\u2019s a sleek black rectangle weighing\n1.5 pounds with a 10.6 inch widescreen touch display -- both\nslightly more than the current-generation iPad -- and front- and\nrear-facing cameras. Turn it on, and you\u2019re greeted with the new\nWindows Start screen, full of big, colorful tiles that display\nupdated information and launch apps.  Beautiful Bauble  Then you\u2019re asked to give your beautiful new bauble a name.\nYou might want something friendly, like maybe \u201cRich\u2019s\nSurface.\u201d Oops, sorry, you\u2019re not allowed to use a space, an\napostrophe or other \u201cspecial characters.\u201d Same old Microsoft.  In tablet mode, the Surface is swift and responsive,\nwhether you\u2019re launching new apps or scrolling between open\nones. Though not quite in the iPad\u2019s league, the screen is nice\nenough -- and the integrated kickstand allows you to prop it up\nat a comfortable angle, perfect for viewing, say, a movie on an\nairline tray table. The kickstand snaps shut with a pleasing\nclick, indicative of the overall solid feel of the device.  But while I generally like the touch interface, and give\nMicrosoft props for not aping the iPad, it simply isn\u2019t as clean\nand intuitive as  Apple (AAPL) \u2019s iOS. As just one small example, it took\nme a very long time to figure out how to change the default\nlocation for the Weather app, followed by multiple steps and\nswipes.  App Selection  Nor can the Surface compete with the iPad on the number and\nvariety of available apps, at least until existing Windows\nprograms get rewritten for the new environment.  I also had issues with its power system, ranging from the\nawkward placement of the connector to a mysterious episode in\nwhich a nearly full battery on Saturday drained to completely\nempty by Monday morning.  Depending on what I was doing, I sometimes coaxed\nMicrosoft\u2019s promised eight hours of battery life out of the\nSurface. But it isn\u2019t as long-lived as the iPad, even with its\noverly aggressive default screen-dimming settings.  The biggest question is how users familiar with previous\nversions of Windows adapt to the new interface, whether on the\nSurface or the other Windows RT and Windows 8 devices to follow.  Something like the traditional Windows desktop environment\nstill exists. But it\u2019s now, essentially, an app launched via a\ntile on that colorful Start screen.  Seeing Double  The potential for confusion is considerable. For instance,\nthere are now two separate versions of Internet Explorer 10: one\nin the new style, for when you\u2019re using the Surface as a tablet,\nand a separate, more traditional one for when you\u2019re working on\nthe desktop.  The Start screen also behaves inconsistently: Some tiles\nlaunch new-style apps while others, such as those for the\npreview versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, toss\nyou into the desktop environment.  While I initially regarded the desktop as a kind of penalty\nbox, I found myself gravitating towards it. In some ways, using\nit on the Surface reminded me of netbooks, those cheap little\nWindows PCs that enjoyed a brief vogue a couple years ago. But\nthis is what a netbook should have been: versatile, with a\nmodern design and an appealing, well-made look and feel.  Microsoft is taking several enormous gambles with the\nSurface. Are users willing to embrace a Windows so different\nfrom what they\u2019ve known for nearly 20 years? How will Intel and\ncomputer makers react to the fact that their software partner is\nnow a direct competitor?  It may just be that the company didn\u2019t have a choice if it\nwanted its flagship software to remain relevant. With the world\nmoving inexorably toward mobile devices, the Surface is the\nfirst Windows PC of the post-PC era.  ( Rich Jaroslovsky  is a Bloomberg News columnist.
