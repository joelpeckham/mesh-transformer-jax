The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n(Corrects size of deficit in 31st paragraph of story\npublished Feb. 18)  Rafael Correa  was re-elected as\n Ecuador \u2019s president yesterday after pledging to boost spending\non the poor while the country runs up its biggest-ever budget\ndeficit.  Preliminary voting tallies showed Correa with 57 percent of\nthe vote in his bid for another four-year term, the  National\nElectoral Council  said yesterday. With 71 percent of the ballots\ncounted, Correa\u2019s nearest rival, Guillermo Lasso, had polled 23\npercent, the agency said. Final results will be released in\ndays, the agency said.  Correa, Ecuador\u2019s first president to be re-elected since\n1968, begins a new term with few options to finance his campaign\npledges as stagnant  oil prices  and slumping growth limit funds\nto boost outlays on social welfare. The self-described socialist\nrevolutionary, who dubbed foreign bondholders \u201ctrue  monsters\u201d\nwhen he defaulted on $3.2 billion of  debt in 2008, may now\nreturn to overseas credit markets to take advantage of a record\nrally in high-yield debt to help fund spending needed to sustain\nan economic expansion.  \u201cI don\u2019t see very simple solutions to attract more\ninvestment,\u201d said Carlos Andres Baca, an analyst at Quito-based\neconomic and political consulting firm Politik. \u201cIt won\u2019t be\neasy to find new financing.\u201d  \u2018Citizens\u2019 Revolution\u2019  As the head of a nation where about a third of the 15.4\nmillion population lives in poverty, the former economics\nprofessor has promised to \u201cradicalize\u201d his \u201ccitizens\u2019\nrevolution\u201d with free education and health care.  \u201cThis victory belongs to each of you,\u201d Correa said\nyesterday from the presidential palace in  Quito . \u201cNo one and\nnothing is stopping this revolution, friends, we are making\nhistory.\u201d  Runner-up Lasso, the former chief executive officer of the\nSouth American nation\u2019s second-biggest publicly traded bank,\n Banco de Guayaquil SA , conceded defeat in a speech from his\nhometown of Guayaquil. \u201cI recognize the triumph of President\nCorrea,\u201d Lasso said last night.  While the 2008 default as well as new laws nationalizing\nthe country\u2019s oil reserves provided short-term economic gains\nfor the president since he took office in 2007, the 49-year-old\nCorrea, an ally of  Venezuela \u2019s  Hugo Chavez , is now paying the\ncost with stagnant crude output and declines in private\ninvestment needed to boost growth.  Credit Markets  One option the government is planning is a return to\ninternational credit markets.  Finance Ministry officials and the lending arm of Ecuador\u2019s\nstate-run pension fund, Biess, are in talks with Citigroup Inc.\nand JPMorgan Chase & Co. to sell debt in international markets,\nChief Executive Officer Efrain Vieira said in a Jan. 28\ninterview.  Vieira, who manages $9.53 billion for the country\u2019s\nretirees, said Biess is seeking a yield of 6.5 percent, less\nthan the 7 percent to 7.5 percent banks say it may obtain.  Ecuador, whose B rating from  Standard & Poor\u2019s  is five\nlevels below investment grade, would be the least-creditworthy\ncountry to sell debt abroad since similarly ranked Lebanon in\nNovember issued $500 million of bonds due in 2023 to yield 6\npercent.  Bolivia , rated two levels higher at BB-, sold $500 million\nof bonds due in 2022 to yield 4.875 percent in October. Zambia,\nranked one level above Ecuador at B+, issued $750 million of\nnotes maturing in 2022 to yield 5.632 percent in September.  Pension Fund  The state-run pension fund\u2019s plan to sell at least $200\nmillion of bonds abroad this year would be a prelude to\nEcuador\u2019s first global sovereign offering since 2005, according\nto Walter Spurrier, director of Guayaquil-based economic\nresearch company Grupo Spurrier.  \u201cThe government wants to return to the market, even more\nafter seeing the appetite for risky countries like Bolivia,\u201d\nSpurrier, whose clients include JPMorgan and the  International\nMonetary Fund , said in an interview from Guayaquil. By using the\npension fund to sell bonds, \u201cit could be that they\u2019re putting\ntheir toe in the water to check the temperature,\u201d he said.  Finance Minister  Patricio Rivera  and central bank President\nDiego Martinez didn\u2019t reply to interview requests made through\ntheir press offices to discuss plans to issue bonds. In July,\nformer central bank President Pedro Delgado said Ecuador was\n\u201cworking hard\u201d to return to the credit market.  \u201cEcuador needs outside capital to continue to develop the\noil industry and remain competitive,\u201d Cynthia Arnson, director\nof the Latin American program at the Woodrow Wilson\nInternational Center for Scholars, said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cThey need outside capital but whether they will be\nable to attract private capital is a huge question mark.\u201d  An increase in the price of oil, tax increases and loans\nfrom  China  have helped Correa more than double spending in the\npast six years, fueling growth.  \u2018Substitute Financing\u2019  Now, with oil prices forecast to remain unchanged around\n$95 per barrel into 2014, the next government will struggle to\nfind money to finance campaign promises, said former Finance\nMinister Fausto Ortiz, who worked with Correa in 2007-2008.  Ecuador\u2019s economy, South America\u2019s seventh biggest, has\ngrown by an average of 5.2 percent a year since Correa came to\npower in January 2007, while inflation has averaged 4.8 percent,\naccording to government data.  The central bank forecasts growth of 4 percent this year,\ndown from an estimated 4.8 percent in 2012. Inflation will slow\nto an average 3.8 percent in 2013, less than the 5.1 percent\naverage last year, according to government data.  Ecuador uses the  U.S. dollar  as its official currency.  Ecuador is \u201cat the mercy of oil prices,\u201d Capital Markets\neconomist  Michael Henderson  said today in a research note to\nclients. \u201cGovernment spending cannot continue to grow at its\nrecent pace and if fiscal policy isn\u2019t tightened now Ecuador\nrisks a harder landing further ahead.\u201d  Before Correa  Before Correa, Ecuador saw three elected presidents fail to\ncomplete their terms. Abdala Bucaram, who adopted the nickname\n\u201cEl Loco\u201d or \u201cMadman\u201d while in power, was voted out of\noffice by Congress in 1997 after being declared mentally unfit\nto rule.  Jamil Mahuad, a Harvard University professor who led\nEcuador\u2019s 1999 default and presided over the collapse of the\nnation\u2019s financial system, stepped down after street protests\nand a military uprising left him without support in 2000.  Lucio Gutierrez, a candidate in this year\u2019s election, was\nthrown out by Congress in 2005 after his decision to fill the\n Supreme Court  with allies was met by months of street protests\nand a military rebellion. Early voting results showed the former\npresident running in third place with 6.5 percent of the vote.  After taking power, Correa pushed through a constitutional\nrewrite, which expanded state control over natural resources and\nstripped the central bank of its autonomy. He then called for\nspecial presidential elections in 2009 to affirm his mandate.  Neither Correa nor Lasso responded to interview requests.  Oil, Revenue  The price of oil, which provides the government with about\n48 percent of its revenue, has jumped 81 percent to $95.86 a\nbarrel since Correa took office, touching a record $145.29 in\nJuly 2008, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a\nlow of $10.72 per barrel in 1998 during Mahuad\u2019s administration.  Ecuador holds South America\u2019s third-largest oil reserves\nand ranks as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019\nsmallest producer with an estimated output capacity of 505,000\nbarrels of crude a day.  In remarks to reporters after the election yesterday,\nCorrea said he\u2019s not worried about how the government will\nattract investment to help finance this year\u2019s $3.68 billion\n budget deficit , the widest on record according to the Finance\nMinistry data dating back to 2001. The government needs about $6\nbillion to cover its total financing needs, according to the\nministry.  \u201cThere is foreign investment, if more comes, better,\u201d\nCorrea said. \u201cWhat this president will never do is mortgage\nthis country to achieve foreign investment goals.\u201d  Public Works  Ecuador\u2019s Finance Minister Patricio Rivera said in December\nthe government plans to use a $2 billion loan from China and\ncredit tied to specific public works projects from regional\nmultilateral lenders to cover the majority of its 2013 financing\nneeds. He didn\u2019t say where the remaining $4 billion will come\nfrom.  Ecuadoreans also voted for a new congress. Correa\u2019s ruling\nAlianza Pais political party may increase its control of the\nlegislature to 80 to 100 of the assembly\u2019s 137 seats, Eurasia\nGroup analyst Risa Grais-Targow said in a Feb. 11 research note.\nWith 32 percent of votes cast for congressional candidates\ncounted, Correa\u2019s party is leading with 51 percent of the vote\nfollowed by Lasso\u2019s CREO party with 12 percent, the electoral\ncouncil said. Final congressional voting results will be\npublished later this week.  China, Commodities  In programs similar to those implemented by Chavez, Correa\nhas used loans from China to rebuild the nation\u2019s crumbling\nenergy infrastructure and expand its hospital system. The\ngovernment in January boosted monthly cash handouts to the poor\nby 43 percent.  Home to untapped copper reserves similar to those of Chile\nand  Peru , the world\u2019s top producers, Ecuador has signed loans\nfor $7.3 billion from China since 2009, or about one-third of\nthe Andean country\u2019s annual budget, according to data compiled\nby Bloomberg based on government announcements.  While Ecuador will have difficulty persuading investors to\ntrust it after defaulting twice in a decade, global demand for\nhigher-yielding assets means the government will probably find\nbuyers willing to take the risk, Carl Ross, a managing director\nat Oppenheimer & Co., said. Investors will probably demand a\nyield of at least 10 percent for a 10-year sovereign bond, he\nsaid.  \u2019Rogue\u2019 Borrower  \u201cEcuador is about as rogue a borrower as you really get,\nbut this is the kind of market where maybe even an Ecuador can\nissue,\u201d Ross said in a telephone interview from Atlanta. \u201cIn\nthis market, with the low  interest rates  that we have, almost\nanything is possible.\u201d  Ecuador, which has South American\u2019s lowest foreign direct\ninvestment rate as a percentage of GDP, has seen yields on its\n$650 million of dollar notes due in 2015, the country\u2019s sole-performing foreign bond, drop 1.04 percentage point to 8.01\npercent in the past two months amid a record rally in global\nhigh-yield debt.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Ecuadorean dollar\nbonds instead of U.S. Treasuries this year has narrowed 116\nbasis points, or 1.16 percentage point, to 710 basis points,\naccording to JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBIG indexes. That compares\nwith a nine basis-point increase for the EMBIG, making Ecuador\nthe third-riskiest economy in  South America  after Venezuela and\n Argentina , JPMorgan data show.  \u201cThis is a government that\u2019s characterized by being\nideological in its words and pragmatic in its actions,\u201d\nPolitik\u2019s Baca said. \u201cIf it\u2019s necessary to sell bonds, I don\u2019t\nthink they\u2019d have a problem finding a justification to do it.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nNathan Gill in Quito at \n ngill4@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAndre Soliani at \n asoliani@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 38.24721908569336 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
