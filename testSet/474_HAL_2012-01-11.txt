 "context": "The following article called 'Super Fracking Goes Deeper to Pump Up Natural Gas Production' was published on 2012-01-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAs regulators and environmentalists\nstudy whether hydraulic fracturing can damage the environment,\nindustry scientists are studying ways to create longer, deeper\ncracks in the earth to release more oil and natural gas.  Energy companies are focused on boosting production and\nlowering costs associated with so-called fracking, a technique\nthat uses high-pressure injections of water, sand and chemicals\nto break apart petroleum-saturated rock. The more thoroughly the\nrock is cracked, the more oil and gas will flow from each well.  The world\u2019s largest oilfield service providers are leading\nthe search for new technologies, with some companies focused on\nsplintering the rock into a web of tiny fissures, and others\nseeking to create larger crevices in the richest zones.  \u201cI want to crack the rock across as much of the reservoir\nas I can,\u201d said  David Pursell , a former fracking engineer who\u2019s\nnow an analyst at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. in Houston.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Holy Grail.\u201d  More aggressive fracking may heighten concerns about the\nrisks associated with shale development, said Kirk Sherr,\npresident of  Regester Larkin Energy North America , an industry\nconsultant.  \u201cIf critics already think fracking is bad, theoretically,\nsuper fracking would be super bad,\u201d Sherr said.  Wider \u2018HiWays\u2019  The U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency  is studying\nwhether fracking can contaminate water resources. The technique\nalso has raised concerns about excessive water consumption\nbecause of the millions of gallons needed to frack each well.  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  has set its sights on \u201csuper cracks,\u201d a\nmethod of blasting deeper into dense rock to create wider\nchannels in order to funnel more oil and gas. The aim for the\ntechnology, branded \u201cDirectConnect,\u201d is to concentrate\nfracking power to target oil or gas buried deeper in the\nformation. The new product is being field tested by select\ncustomers, Rustom Mody, vice president of technology at Baker\nHughes, said in a telephone interview.  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  has developed its own version of a super\ncrack after six years of research. Called  HiWay , it injects\nmaterial to prop open wider pathways for the oil and gas to\nflow. The number of companies using HiWay in  North America  has\ngrown from two a year ago to more than 20, the company said in\nOctober. Initial production at a well in the Barnett Shale was\n\u201csignificantly higher\u201d with the technology, Chief Executive\nOfficer Paal Kibsgaard told investors Aug. 30 at a Gleneagles,\nScotland, energy conference.  No Seismic Impacts  Local officials in  Texas ,  Oklahoma ,  Arkansas  and  Ohio  are\nconcerned about outbreaks of small earthquakes that have been\noccurring in areas where drilling has been accelerating.\nSeismologists have concluded it\u2019s not the fracking causing the\nquakes. Rather, they found evidence it\u2019s the injection\nunderground of waste water from the wells that may change\nsubterranean pressures in the rock, triggering tremors.  Jon Olson , an associate professor at the  University of\nTexas  in Austin who studies fracking, said he\u2019s not aware of it\ncausing any sizable earthquakes in the U.S.  Wider or deeper fractures won\u2019t create bigger environmental\nproblems, David Burnett, director of technology at Texas A&M\nUniversity\u2019s Energy Institute, said in an interview.  \u201cThe fracturing process is not causing the problems that\nare perceived by the public,\u201d Burnett said. \u201cNo change in\nfracturing technology would change that.\u201d  Concern in \u2018Unknowns\u2019  Most of the concern lies in the unknowns about the effects\nof fracking, Sherr said.  \u201cHow do you test a frack fluid that in and of itself is\nchanging per well, per application, in terms of the various\nchemicals and other components,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a\nferociously competitive business,\u201d raising the possibility that\nsome technology from smaller service providers \u201cmight not have\nbeen fully thought-through or tested prior to application in the\nfield.\u201d  New fracking techniques may not be any riskier than\nexisting methods, said Amy Mall, senior policy analyst at the\nNational Resources Defense Council.  \u201cJust like any other type of fracking, we need a lot more\nindependent scientific data and research to understand the risks\nand how best to prevent them,\u201d she said in a telephone\ninterview.  Schlumberger has said its HiWay technology provides\nenvironmental benefits by reducing water and sand use and the\ncorresponding number of trucks delivering the materials.  More Finesse  Fracking, which has been around commercially since the\n1950\u2019s, hadn\u2019t advanced much beyond \u201cbrute force and\nignorance,\u201d former Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Andrew Gould said when the company acquired Smith International in\nFebruary 2010. That\u2019s now starting to change, he told investors\non an Oct. 21 conference call.  The ability to tap into vast new oil and gas resources in\nshale formations is driving a wave of innovation to hone the\ntechnique and provide companies with a competitive advantage.  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  is developing a plan it calls \u201cfrack of\nthe future\u201d that offers better technology to reduce the need\nfor materials and labor for each well in addition to speeding up\nand increasing production, the company says.  To speed up the fracking process and reduce costs, Baker\nHughes has developed disintegrating frack balls. Wells are\nfracked in stages, and companies drop down plastic balls to plug\nthe well bore at various stages and isolate different zones for\nfracking. It can take several days to get a rig out to the site\nand fish out conventional frack balls used over the course of 20\nor 30 stages in a typical well before production can begin.  Alka-Seltzer-like  Baker Hughes\u2019s invention disintegrates, turning the balls\ninto powder \u201clike an Alka-Seltzer\u201d tablet after about half a\nday, Mody said.  Halliburton\u2019s contribution is called  RapidFrac , a series of\nsliding sleeves that open throughout the horizontal well bore to\nisolate zones for fracking. Sliding sleeves are different from\nthe other main type of fracking technique, which sends an\nexplosive charge down the well bore to blast a hole in the\ncasing. In both techniques, fracking fluid is then injected at\nhigh pressure through the hole, cracking the rock.  Sliding sleeves, which all three service companies offer,\ncan cut costs in the Bakken from as much as $2.5 million per\nwell to $750,000, according to a Sept. 19 investor note from\n JPMorgan Chase & Co . The Bakken is a geological formation that\nstretches from  Alberta  to the Northern U.S. Great Plains.  \u201cWe aren\u2019t quite ready to call it a game changer\nconsidering its applications are limited to only a handful of\nbasins,\u201d according to the note written by a team led by analyst\nJ.  David Anderson . \u201cBut it clearly is one more tool that\nseparates the big three service companies from everyone else.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDavid Wethe in Houston  at \n dwethe@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSusan Warren at \n susanwarren@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Halliburton Company was 30.860816955566406 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Halliburton Company was ",
