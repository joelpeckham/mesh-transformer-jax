 "context": "The following article called 'Brown-Forman Net Misses Estimates on Higher Costs' was published on 2008-02-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrown-Forman Corp. (BF/B) , the maker of Jack\nDaniel's whiskey, said third-quarter  profit  rose less than\nanalysts projected as grain costs climbed and sales of Southern\nComfort liqueur slowed.  \n The stock fell the most in two weeks as the maker of spirits\nand wine narrowed the range of its full-year earnings forecast.  \n Higher sales of Jack Daniel's bourbon and Finlandia vodka were\ndamped by declining purchases of Southern Comfort after the company\nraised prices in a slowing economy. Brown-Forman's gross margin,\nthe share of sales after subtracting the cost of goods sold,\nnarrowed 2 percentage points, mostly on grain used for distilling.  \n ``The price of corn and wheat and other agricultural\ncommodities have really just been increasing at a substantially\nhigher rate than we had guessed,'' Kaumil Gajrawala, an analyst\nwith UBS Securities LLC in  New York , said in a research note.\n``It's going to be the thing to watch for the next year or so.''  \n The company's Class B  shares  fell $2.30, or 3.5 percent, to\n$63.77 at 4:16 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite  trading ,\nthe most since Feb. 13. They've dropped 14 percent this year.  \n Net income climbed 10 percent to $116 million, or 94 cents a\nshare, the Louisville, Kentucky-based company said today in a\nstatement. The average estimate of six  analysts  surveyed by\nBloomberg was for third-quarter earnings of 99 cents a share.  \n Sales increased 16 percent to $877.4 million including\nexcise taxes in the three months through January, missing the\n$879.2 million average estimate of analysts.  \n Rising Grain Prices  \n Brown-Forman narrowed its full-year profit forecast to $3.42\nto $3.50 a share, from $3.42 to $3.54.  \n Rising grain prices have cost Brown-Forman an additional $7\nmillion since May and will total about $10 million for the\ncompany by April, Chief Financial Officer Phoebe Wood said on a\nconference call.  \n Southern Comfort wholesale shipments to retailers declined\nby a ``low-single'' digit percentage globally, Wood said.  \n U.S. sales of Jack Daniel's on a volume basis, which\ndeclined in the second quarter, rose by a ``low-single'' digit\npercentage during the third quarter. International volume sales\nof the bourbon, the company's biggest selling product, advanced\nby a ``mid-single'' digit, Brown-Forman said.  \n ``Slower international trends are giving less offset to a\nweakened U.S.,'' Andrew Sawyer, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &\nCo. in New York, said in a research note. He recommended selling\nthe stock, citing ``weak fundamentals over the immediate term.''  \n Spirits accounted for 86 percent of the company's 2007\nrevenue.  \n Advertising Spending  \n Operating income in the quarter rose 8 percent. The company\nboosted advertising spending 14 percent to $108 million.  \n ``They have been able to show decent growth in  North America \nwith operating income while still investing in the business,''\n Thomas Russo , a partner at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster,\n Pennsylvania , said in a telephone interview.  \n Brown-Forman repurchased $122 million of its shares in the\nquarter, nearly completing $200 million in buybacks authorized in\nNovember, Wood said during the conference call.  \n Liquor sales in the U.S. climbed 5.6 percent to $18.2\nbillion last year, the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S. said\nlast month. Sales growth may slow to 4.6 percent this year, which\nwould be the smallest gain since 2001, the group said.  \n (A recording of the company's conference call on the third\nquarter is available at  http://www.brown-forman.com .)  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nDuane D.
