 "context": "The following article called 'BAT, Burberry, Valeant, Google: Intellectual Property' was published on 2012-04-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTrademark use by companies in\n Australia  is a privilege that the government can curtail,\nQueensland state\u2019s solicitor-general said in defending the\ncountry\u2019s plain-packaging legislation for cigarettes.  \u201cPrivilege is not property,\u201d Walter Sofronoff,\nQueensland\u2019s solicitor-general, told the seven-judge panel of\nAustralia\u2019s High Court yesterday during the second day of a\nhearing on the legality of the plain-packaging law. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nliberty to act unless regulated by law.\u201d  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) ,  Europe \u2019s biggest cigarette\nmaker, and  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  were joined by  Philip Morris\nInternational Inc. (PM) , the largest publicly traded tobacco\nmanufacturer, and  Imperial Tobacco Group Plc (IMT)  in a  challenge  to\nthe Australian law requiring cigarettes to be sold in uniform\npackages. The tobacco companies are seeking a ruling deeming the\nAustralian law unconstitutional for seizing their intellectual\nproperty without adequate compensation.  Australia\u2019s trademark law is in place to ensure companies\u2019\nlogos are protected from misuse by competitors or individuals,\nSofronoff said.  The government crossed a line with the new rules that\nprohibit the use of logos and trademarks, moving from regulating\ntobacco sales by requiring warning messages to \u201ccommandeering\npeople\u2019s property,\u201d Bret Walker, a lawyer for Imperial Tobacco,\ntold the court yesterday.  \u201cIt is wrong to hypothesize the extreme use of the\npower,\u201d Stephen Gageler, the federal solicitor-general, told\nthe court.  A more realistic example would be the requirement that all\ncars sold in Australia are required to be fitted with seatbelts,\nGageler said.  Australia\u2019s government is confident the law will be upheld,\nAttorney-General Nicola Roxon told reporters before the start of\nthe hearings.  \u201cTobacco is the only legal product sold in Australia which\nif used as intended will kill you,\u201d Roxon said. \u201cNo other\nproduct is in that category.\u201d  Lawyers representing the tobacco companies were repeatedly\nchallenged on their positions by six of the seven justices, with\nChief Justice Robert French echoing Roxon\u2019s concerns.  \u201cYou\u2019re putting into the market a substance that causes\nserious disease or is fatal,\u201d French said, adding that puts\ntobacco in a different category from cars or soft drinks.  Under the plain-packaging law, cigarettes will be sold with\nno company logos and the same font for all brands on a dark\nbrown background. Graphic health warnings will cover 90 percent\nof the back of the package and 70 percent of the front. The law\nwas approved by the Australian Senate on Nov. 10.  The case is British American Tobacco Australia Ltd. v the\nCommonwealth of Australia. S389/2011. High Court of Australia\n(Canberra).  Appeals Court Upholds Burberry Plaid Counterfeiter\u2019s Conviction  The conviction of an importer of counterfeit items for\ninfringing  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) \u2019s trademarks was upheld by a\nfederal appeals court.  The appeals court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that\nthe term \u201csubstantially indistinguishable\u201d to refer to the\nplaid design and knight image used on fake goods and legitimate\nBurberry products was constitutionally vague.  The fake goods had a plaid pattern and a knight image that\nthe defendants called the \u201cMarco plaid.\u201d The government argued\nthat they were virtually identical to marks used by the London-\nbased luxury-goods company.  The court said that in its proper context, \u201cthe meaning of\nthe term is plain.\u201d  The appeals court case is U.S. v. Chong Lam, 11-4056, U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The lower court case\nis U.S. v. Lam,  3:07-cr-00374-JRS, U.S. District Court, Eastern\nDistrict of  Virginia  (Richmond).  For more trademark news, click here.

Copyright  Google \u2018Did Nothing Wrong,\u2019 CEO Page Tells Jury in Java Case  Google Inc. (GOOG)  Chief Executive Officer Larry Page, disputing\nclaims that the leading search engine operator stole Java\nsoftware technology from  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , told a jury his company\n\u201cdid nothing wrong.\u201d  Page, the first witness to be called by Oracle attorney\nDavid Boies yesterday at a trial in federal court in  San\nFrancisco , said Google negotiated hard over a partnership with\nOracle, the largest maker of database software, over the Java\nprogramming language.  \u201cWe really wanted to use Java\u2019s technology,\u201d Page\ntestified. \u201cWhen we weren\u2019t able to come to terms on a business\npartnership, we went down our own path.\u201d  Oracle, based in Redwood City,  California , claims in a\nlawsuit filed in 2010 that Google infringed copyrights and\npatents for Java in creating the Android operating system for\nmobile devices.  Google acknowledges using Java to develop Android and says\nits use was fair and legal and Google engineers wrote original\ncode for Android. Google rejected a proposal by Java creator Sun\nMicrosystems Inc. in 2006, before it was acquired by Oracle,\nthat the search engine company pay $100 million for a three-year\ntechnology partnership to build Android jointly, Google\u2019s\nlawyers disclosed in the case last year.  Google was careful with the technology to ensure that\nAndroid and the company \u201crespect intellectual property,\u201d Page\nsaid during his testimony.  He said he didn\u2019t recall or couldn\u2019t speculate about\nseveral issues Boies questioned him about, including who Google\nengineer Tim Lindholm is.  Lindholm wrote a 2010 e-mail saying he was asked by Page\nand Google co-founder Sergey Brin to find an alternative to Java\nand determined that Google should take a license for the\nlanguage. Shown the e-mail, and other documents featuring\nLindholm, Page said he couldn\u2019t recall Lindholm, giving him any\ndirections concerning Java or whether Lindholm had recommended\nthat Google take a license for Java.  Oracle is seeking $1 billion in damages and a court order\nblocking distribution of Android unless Mountain View,\nCalifornia-based Google pays for a license.  The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 10-03561,\nU.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San\nFrancisco).  Two Chinese Nationals Charged by U.S. Over Software Piracy  Two Chinese nationals were charged by the U.S. for\nillegally exporting technology to their home country and\npirating software from U.S. companies including  Agilent\nTechnologies Inc. (A) , federal officials said.  Xiang Li, 35, and Chun Yan Li, 33, a married couple from\nChengdu,  China , were indicted by a federal grand jury in\nWilmington, Delaware, according to a statement yesterday by the\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.  \u201cCounterfeiting and intellectual-property theft are\nseriously undermining U.S. business and innovation -- more than\n$100 million in lost revenue in this one case alone,\u201d John\nMorton, the agency\u2019s director, said in the statement.  The couple are accused of running a website called \u201cCrack\n99\u201d that sold copies of software where the \u201caccess-control\nmechanisms\u201d had been circumvented, Morton said. The pair is\ncharged in the indictment with distributing more than 500\npirated copyrighted works to more than 300 purchasers in the\nU.S. and overseas from April 2008 to June 2011.  Xiang Li was arrested by federal agents in June 2011 on an\nearlier indictment in the case. Chun Yan Li \u201cremains an at-\nlarge fugitive in Chengdu,\u201d according to the statement.  An Agilent software product, which retails for $45,000, was\namong the programs illegally copied by the couple, according to\nthe indictment.  Stuart Matlow, a spokesman for Santa Clara, California-\nbased Agilent, wasn\u2019t immediately available to respond to a\nphone call and e-mail seeking comment on the indictment.  A Maryland resident who was a customer of the Crack99\npleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit criminal copyright\ninfringement, the government said in a  statement . Cosburn\nWedderburn, of Windsor Mill, Maryland, bought more than $1\nmillion worth of pirated software, according to the government\nstatement.  He faces a potential prison sentence of as long as five\nyears and a fine of as much as $250,000, or twice the loss the\nmakers of the legitimated pirated software suffered as a result\nof his actions, the government said.
