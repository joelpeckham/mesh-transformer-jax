 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Stocks Fall on Cisco Outlook; Euro Weakens, Copper Gains' was published on 2010-11-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. stocks fell for the third time\nthis week as  Cisco Systems Inc.  said profit will miss analyst\nestimates, while the euro weakened and Irish bonds slid amid\nconcern indebted European nations may need bailouts. London\ncopper touched a record as China\u2019s industrial production grew.  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index sank 0.4 percent to\n1,213.54 at 4 p.m. in New York. The measure extended losses\nafter Walt Disney Co. reported earnings that trailed estimates.\nThe euro weakened against 14 of its 16 most-traded peers and\nreached a one-month low versus the dollar. The yield on Irish\n10-year bonds rose to a record 6.52 percentage points above\nbenchmark German bunds.  Cisco\u2019s forecast triggered a selloff in technology\ncompanies, the group that has led the S&P 500\u2019s 16 percent rally\nsince the end of August. Bank shares followed the euro and Irish\nbonds lower after French Finance Minister  Christine Lagarde  said\nyesterday that investors must share the cost of sovereign debt\nrestructurings, backing a German call that helped drive yields\non so-called peripheral bonds to record highs.  \u201cCisco\u2019s sector is a bellwether in terms of companies\u2019\ncapital expenditures,\u201d said  James Dunigan , chief investment\nofficer at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, which oversees\n$105 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to look at one company and say we\u2019re\noff track, but people will always try to look a little further\nfor an idea of economic growth going forward. The backdrop to\nall this is the European situation, where these countries still\nface the challenge of bringing their fiscal houses in order.\u201d  Yesterday\u2019s Gain Lost  The S&P 500 wiped out yesterday\u2019s 0.4 percent advance and\nfell below its lowest close since Nov. 3, the day the Federal\nReserve announced plans to pump as much as $600 billion into the\neconomy through purchases of Treasuries.  Cisco , the sixth-largest U.S. technology company by market\nvalue, tumbled 16 percent, the most in more than 16 years. The\ncompany faced a \u201cchallenging economic environment\u201d last\nquarter, Chief Executive Officer  John Chambers  said. He blamed\nthe slump on lower government spending in developed countries\nand market-share losses. Competition has forced Cisco to cut\nprices on some products and seek acquisitions to maintain growth.  S&P 500 technology companies lost 1.8 percent collectively,\nthe biggest drop among 10 groups. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells\nFargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp. paced losses in banks.  Disney  slumped 2.9 percent after saying fourth-quarter\nprofit excluding certain items fell to 45 cents a share, missing\nby 2 cents the average estimate of 25 analysts in a Bloomberg\nsurvey.  \u2018They Disappointed\u2019  \u201cLike Cisco, Disney is the kind of company that\u2019s held to\nhigh regard and they basically disappointed,\u201d said  Jason Cooper ,\nwho oversees $2.5 billion in South Bend, Indiana at 1st Source\nInvestment Advisors, which owns shares of Disney. \u201cWe had such\nnegative news today it probably didn\u2019t matter who you were, if\nyou had any kind of miss or blip, you were going to get punished.\nThis will probably continue to add negative pressure when we see\nstocks open tomorrow.\u201d  Almost 76  percent  of companies in the S&P 500 that reported\nearnings since Oct. 7 have beaten analysts\u2019 estimates for per-\nshare profit, according to data  compiled by Bloomberg . Viacom\nInc., the owner of MTV Networks and Comedy Central, had adjusted\nquarterly profit of 75 cents a share, compared with the 70-cent\naverage estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Its Class B\nshares rallied 2.8 percent.  Three stocks fell for every one that gained in Europe\u2019s\nStoxx 600. Bank of Ireland tumbled 7.9 percent and Royal Bank of\nScotland Group Plc slumped 2.7 percent.  Telefonica SA , Europe\u2019s\nsecond-biggest phone company, slid 1.6 percent as earnings\nmissed estimates. Siemens AG rallied 2.6 percent after boosting\nits dividend.  Euro Slips  The euro slid 0.9 percent to $1.3658, while the Dollar\nIndex, which tracks the U.S. currency against those of six\ntrading partners,  added  0.7 percent, rising for the fifth\nconsecutive day, the longest run of gains since August.  The yuan rose 0.1 percent to 6.6257 per dollar as leaders\nof the Group of 20 nations gathered in Seoul amid growing\nconcern about trade imbalances and foreign-exchange controls.\nThe currency reached 6.6173 in Shanghai, the highest since 1993,\namid speculation policy makers will accept a stronger yuan to\ncurb inflation and meet the demands of trading partners.  The bonds of Ireland, Greece and Spain declined, sending\nspreads over bunds wider. The gap between Greek 10-year bonds\nand similar-maturity German debt  increased  20 basis points, or\n0.20 percentage point, to 917 basis points, with the Spanish-\nGerman spread expanding 16 basis points to 220 basis points.  \u2018Nail in Coffin\u2019  \u201cLagarde\u2019s comments mentioned restructuring, and that\u2019s\nanother nail in the coffin\u201d for peripheral debt, said  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income research at HSBC Holdings Plc\nin London. \u201cThere\u2019s still a big constituency of investors and\ntraders who have not recognized until now that restructuring\ncould happen.\u201d  The cost of insuring the bonds of Irish banks soared to\ndistressed levels amid concern that the government won\u2019t be able\nto afford the cost of bailing out the nation\u2019s banks. Credit-\ndefault swaps on subordinated debt of Allied Irish Banks Plc,\nthe nation\u2019s second-largest lender, are 60 percent upfront and 5\npercent a year, meaning it costs 6 million euros ($8.2 million)\nin advance and 500,000 euros annually to insure 10 million euros\nof the bank\u2019s debt for five years.  U.S. bond markets are closed for the Veterans\u2019 Day holiday.  The Kospi, South Korea\u2019s benchmark equities gauge, plunged\n2.7 percent in the last minute of trading, as the expiration of\noptions contracts spurred the largest-ever sale of equities by\nforeign investors. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index  of 21\ncountries retreated 0.9 percent, falling for a second day after\nreaching the highest level since June 2008 last week.  Emerging Markets  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended closing out its\nsuggested bet that emerging market  stocks  will outperform the\nS&P 500, citing improving U.S. economic data on jobs and service\nindustries and inflation in developing nations. Investors should\nclose positions that benefit from outperformance of the iShares\nMSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund over the S&P 500, Goldman Sachs\nstrategists said in a note to clients.  The emerging-markets exchange-traded fund gained 29 percent\nfrom the end of June through yesterday, compared with an 18\npercent advance for the S&P 500.  \u201cThe near-term outlook for this type of relative trade\nversus the U.S. is more muddied than it has been for some\ntime,\u201d the Goldman report said. Equities in emerging markets\n\u201cshould remain broadly well-supported, but after a strong run\nsince September, it will be important to be more selective going\nforward.\u201d  China Rating  China had its debt rating raised one step today to Aa3 by\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service, which cited the nation\u2019s financial\nstrength and ability to contain losses from a credit boom.  China\u2019s  Shanghai Composite Index  advanced 1 percent after\nMoody\u2019s upgraded the nation\u2019s debt to the fourth-highest\ninvestment grade. The nation\u2019s efforts to tackle asset bubbles\nand avert the spread of bad loans has meant the \u201clikely\ncontainment and effective management\u201d of losses from record\nlending last year to counter the financial crisis, Moody\u2019s said.\nThat combined with China\u2019s \u201cresilient\u201d economic growth were\nreasons for the upgrade, the ratings company said.  Copper pared gains after touching an all-time high of\n$8,966 a metric ton in London after China\u2019s industrial\nproduction advanced 13 percent in October.  The S&P  GSCI  index of 24 commodities slipped 0.3 percent.\nCotton futures, which reached a record for a seventh straight\nday during the trading session yesterday, declined amid mounting\nsigns that demand will ease in China, the world\u2019s biggest\nconsumer. Orange juice also dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nInyoung Hwang in New York at   ihwang7@bloomberg.net ;\n Stephen Kirkland  in London at \n skirkland@bloomberg.net .
