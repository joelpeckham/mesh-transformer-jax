The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n 23 PM / in a minute Myanmar denies report of new mass graves in Rakhine Reuters Staff 4 Min Read \nYANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar denied on Friday that there were mass graves in a village in troubled Rakhine state, where a military crackdown on insurgents has triggered the flight of nearly 690,000 minority Rohingya Muslims to neighboring Bangladesh. \nThe Associated Press has reported it had confirmed the existence of more than five previously unreported mass graves in the village of Gu Dar Pyin, through interviews with survivors in refugee camps in Bangladesh and through time-stamped cellphone videos. \nThe Myanmar government\u2019s Information Committee, part of the office of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, said in a statement on its Facebook page that local authorities and security officials formed a \u201cground team\u201d that investigated the report. \n\u201cThe ground team went to the locations that were mentioned in the AP news story as where the bodies were buried and found out that it is not true,\u201d the statement said. \n\u201cBesides, they met with local elders and villagers and asked whether there were mass killings or not and the villagers told them that there were none.\u201d \nThe statement said, however, that 19 \u201cterrorists\u201d had been killed when they attacked security forces in the village in late August and that their bodies had been \u201cproperly buried\u201d. \nTwo Rohingya residents, who were still in the village and spoke to Reuters by telephone, disputed the government\u2019s statement and said that there were mass graves there. They said senior military officers visited the area on Friday, took photographs and held a meeting with the villagers. \nThe residents, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisal, were speaking by telephone to a Reuters reporter at the Balukhali refugee camp in Bangladesh. The reporter was put in touch with them by former residents who have fled Rakhine. \nOne resident said his father attended the meeting, where officers asked how many people had been killed in the violence, who burned their houses and whether there were mass graves there. \n\u201cThe villagers were frightened and said they didn\u2019t know how many had died or who had burned their houses but said, yes, there are mass graves here,\u201d the resident said. \nAnother resident of the village said three senior military officials arrived late in the morning, took pictures of a mass grave beside his house and then called a meeting at the school. \n\u201cThe senior officials are gone now but a large group of military men stayed behind and the villagers are scared,\u201d the resident said. \nSuu Kyi\u2019s spokesman referred requests for comment on the villagers\u2019 description of events to the Rakhine state government. A spokesman from the state government was not immediately available. The military said it had no immediate comment. \nReporters are not allowed access to the area, in the north of Rakhine state. The army launched a sweeping counteroffensive there in response to Rohingya militant attacks on Aug. 25. \nThe United Nations has condemned the army\u2019s campaign as ethnic cleansing. Myanmar denies that, saying its forces were carrying out legitimate counterinsurgency operations. \nThe military has acknowledged that Buddhist villagers and soldiers killed 10 people it described as captured Muslim terrorists and buried them in a grave in the village of Inn Din in early September. It has said action will be taken against those responsible.
