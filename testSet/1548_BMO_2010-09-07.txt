 "context": "The following article called 'Carney Rate Decision Divides Market the Most in 17 Months: Canada Credit' was published on 2010-09-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney \nhas investors and analysts divided by the most in 17 months on\nwhether the central bank will raise interest rates at tomorrow\u2019s\npolicy meeting.  \n One-month overnight index swaps indicate that 65 percent of\ninvestors expect policy makers to raise the  benchmark lending \nrate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s the lowest\namount since April 2009, just before Carney introduced a\nconditional commitment to hold rates through June of this year.  \n Twelve of the 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News\n expect  Carney to raise borrowing costs a quarter point to 1\npercent, while the rest say he\u2019ll stand pat. It\u2019s the biggest\nsplit since April 2009. For the June 1 announcement, by\ncomparison, all but two of 27 economists said he would raise\nrates, and all 20 surveyed in July predicted an increase.  \n \u201cFor the last two weeks, the market has been almost\nperfectly split in its expectations,\u201d said  Mohammed Ahmed , a\nrates strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in\nToronto. \u201cThere\u2019s this general consensus that the bank will be\nforced to the sidelines at some point in the cycle, and that\u2019s\nwhat\u2019s resulting in a lot of uncertainty and volatility.\u201d  \n Canada\u2019s economy is recovering from the recession faster\nthan its U.S. counterpart, having already returned to its pre-\nrecession  employment level , and Carney has said the bank\u2019s\ncurrent 0.75 percent rate still provides \u201cconsiderable monetary\nstimulus.\u201d  \n \u2018Holding Up\u2019  \n \u201cThe main reason to go would be that  real rates  are still\nnegative and the Canadian economy, especially on the domestic\nfront, is still showing signs of holding up relatively well,\u201d\nsaid  Doug Porter , deputy chief economist with Bank of Montreal\u2019s\nBMO Capital Markets unit in Toronto. He predicts the central\nbank will raise rates tomorrow and then pause until next year.  \n Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors\ndemand to own Canadian corporate bonds rather than federal debt\nnarrowed to 148 basis points on Sept. 3, from 149 basis points\nthe day before, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nindex. Spreads have been as wide as 154 basis points and as\nnarrow as 114 basis points this year. Yields rose to 3.8 percent\non Sept. 3, from 3.72 percent the day before.  \n The securities have returned 7.02 percent this year,\nincluding reinvested interest, lagging behind the 7.06 percent\ngain for the broader index.  \n Spreads on provincial and municipal bonds were unchanged at\n59 basis points on Sept. 3, according to a separate Merrill\nLynch index. The yield on the bonds, which have returned 7.05\npercent this year, ended Sept. 3 at 3.08 percent.  \n Slowing Growth  \n The Canadian  economy , after growing at an annualized 5.8\npercent in the first quarter, slowed more than expected to 2\npercent -- a full percentage point below the central bank\u2019s July\nprediction. As well,  employers shed  workers in July for the\nfirst time this year and inflation, as measured by the bank\u2019s\npreferred  core rate , slowed to 1.6 percent in July, Statistics\nCanada reported in August.  \n Carney\u2019s rate decision is \u201ca closer call, especially since\nwe did have the Fed slightly change tack in August and, perhaps\nmore importantly, the Canadian data have started to show some\ncracks as well,\u201d Porter said.  \n The gap between the central bank\u2019s  policy rate  and the one-\nmonth overnight index swap rate rose 5 basis points to 0.17\npercent on Sept. 3.  The spread  , which tends to widen as traders\nincrease wagers on higher interest rates, stood at 0.25 percent\ntwo days before the July decision and 0.18 percent before the\nJune 1 announcement. The swap rate measures what investors\npredict the bank\u2019s policy rate will average over that period.  \n Not Pre-Ordained  \n U.S. Federal Reserve officials said on Aug. 10 they will\nmaintain their holdings of securities to prevent money from\nbeing drained out of the financial system in their first attempt\nto bolster the economy in more than a year. The Fed also\nretained a commitment to keep its benchmark interest rate close\nto zero for an \u201cextended period.\u201d  \n While the Canadian bank\u2019s outlook includes a \u201ca gradual\nreduction in monetary stimulus,\u201d futures rate decisions aren\u2019t\n\u201cpre-ordained,\u201d as there are elevated risks around the\nprojections, Carney said on July 22.  \n \u201cAn issue is how far ahead of the Fed the Bank can run,\u201d\nsaid  Derek Holt , an economist at Bank of Nova Scotia\u2019s Scotia\nCapital unit in Toronto who predicts the central bank will raise\none more time before pausing for the remainder of the year.\n\u201cThe Bank has probably the best case in its history of  parting\ncompany  from the Fed,\u201d because Carney hasn\u2019t had the same\nproblems as the Fed in getting interest rates to boost growth.  \n Tomorrow\u2019s policy statement \u201cwill be much the same as the\npast couple of  statements  in terms of a relatively neutral bias\nthat keeps markets guessing right up until the very next one in\nOctober,\u201d Holt said.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Alexandre Deslongchamps  in Ottawa at \n adeslongcham@bloomberg.net .  \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n     \n         \n             Chart:  Chart of investor certainty for Bank of Canada desision\n         \n     \n         \n\n     \n//<![CDATA[\n\n            $(document).ready(function () {\n        $(\".view_story #story_content .attachments img.small_img\").each(function(){\n          var self = $(this);\n          if (self.width() != 190){\n            self.width(190);\n        }\n        });\n      });\n    \n//]]>\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was 36.6993293762207 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was ",
