The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWith U.S. auto sales percolating at\nthe best pace since 2007, parts suppliers are riding high, too --\nand none more so than  BorgWarner Inc. (BWA)   BorgWarner outperformed every auto supplier in  North\nAmerica  over the past three years. Shares of the turbocharger\nmaker more than doubled from 2010 through 2012, which means that\nsolid, stolid old BorgWarner, founded in the Roaring \u201920s, beat\nsome far more stylish companies. From the beginning of 2010, its\nstock returned four times more than  Google Inc. (GOOG)   The question now is whether Auburn Hills, Michigan-based\nBorgWarner\u2019s hot hand gives new Chief Executive Officer James Verrier a big head start in doing well or an impossibly hard act\nto follow. The exact split of opinion is telling: Among analysts\n surveyed  by Bloomberg, 12 rate it a buy and 12 a hold. There are\nno sells.  \u201cHe has a significantly tougher job because he\u2019s\ninheriting a business that\u2019s operating well and has high\nexpectations,\u201d Matt Stover, an analyst with Guggenheim\nSecurities in  Boston , said in an interview.  The surge in BorgWarner\u2019s market value to $8.75 billion as\nof yesterday has been part of a rally throughout the U.S.\nsupplier industry. The  Bloomberg Industries North American Auto\nParts index  more than doubled since the start of 2010 to a 52-\nweek closing high of 408.21 yesterday. U.S. employment in the\nsector, which peaked at 845,900 in June 2000, rebounded to\n487,300 in January after bottoming in July 2009 at 386,300,\naccording to the Original Equipment Supplier Association, a\ntrade group.  Company History  BorgWarner was founded in 1928 by a group of entrepreneurs\nthat included the inventor of the first manual transmission,\naccording to the company\u2019s  website . While it still makes\ntransmission parts, its primary product is turbochargers and it\ncompetes in a crowded space that also includes giants\n Continental AG (CON) ,  Robert Bosch GmbH  and  Cummins Inc. (CMI)  As recently\nas April 2010, it was trading at a 64 percent discount to the\nauto parts index.  That\u2019s when the revival of the U.S. car industry began to\ntake hold. Just as important for BorgWarner, governments around\nthe world increasingly began mandating more efficient engines\nfor better gas mileage.  Demand for BorgWarner\u2019s turbochargers soared. The company\nhas 29 percent of the U.S. market, ahead of Cummins and\n Honeywell International Inc. (HON) , with 27 percent and 23 percent,\naccording to IBISWorld, a Santa Monica, California-based\nresearcher.  Turbochargers compress air to maximize the power an engine\nproduces. Automakers, forced by governments in the U.S., Europe\nand Asia to improve  fuel efficiency  and lower emissions, are\nturning to smaller, lighter engines. They\u2019re using turbos to\ngive buyers the power and acceleration they still want.  CAFE Rating  \u201cSmaller displacement and forced induction,\u201d  Kevin Tynan ,\nauto analyst for Bloomberg Industries in Skillman, New Jersey,\nsaid in an interview. \u201cThis is the way the industry is going.\u201d  The U.S. requires automakers to double their corporate\naverage fuel economy rating, known as CAFE, to 54.5 miles (88\nkilometers) per gallon by 2025.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  said April 2 that about 40 percent of the\nF-150 pickups it has sold to individual buyers this year in the\nU.S. had six-cylinder engines powered by turbos BorgWarner helps\nsupply. As recently as 2010, Ford didn\u2019t sell any six-cylinder\nF-150s.  Light-vehicle makers bought about 25 million turbos\nglobally last year, BorgWarner estimates. By 2017, that number\nwill increase to 41 million, the company projects. Just-\nAuto.com, a Bromsgrove, England-based market research firm,\nforecasts as many as 44.9 million by 2017.  Turbocharger Stats  Sales of turbochargers for light vehicles alone make up 26\npercent of BorgWarner\u2019s $7.18 billion in annual revenue. Its\ncustomers include Ford,  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Daimler AG (DAI) , Hyundai Motor\nCo. and  General Motors Co. (GM)   Turbo sales will make up about half of BorgWarner\u2019s net new\nbusiness for 2013 through 2015, according to the company. Of\nthat, 80 percent is outside the U.S., for customers such as\nFord, VW,  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and  Fiat SpA. (F)   China \nrepresents about a third of BorgWarner\u2019s net new business.  \u201cBorgWarner\u2019s portfolio is uniquely situated around fuel\nefficiency and will play a major role in automakers\u2019 ability to\nmeet more stringent requirements,\u201d Joseph Spak, an analyst with\n RBC Capital Markets , who rates BorgWarner the equivalent of a\nbuy, wrote in a research note.  The company\u2019s discount to the Auto Parts Index began\nnarrowing after April 2010, according to weekly data compiled by\nBloomberg. Investors paid as much as a 55 percent premium for\nBorgWarner\u2019s forecast earnings when compared with the index in\nJuly 2012, the data show.  Manganello\u2019s Record  Analysts give credit to Tim Manganello, who was named CEO\nof BorgWarner on Feb. 5, 2003. He was known for spending to\nsupport the business and keeping tight controls on the rest.\nVisitors to the corporate offices, for example, looked up the\nCEO\u2019s extension from a vinyl binder on a counter next to the\nphone. No secretary, no comfy waiting area. The nearby research\nand development center was a bit more plush.  \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d Stover said. \u201cIt showed they were\nputting their money where it mattered. As an investor, you like\nthat.\u201d  Manganello, 63, retired at the end of last year. The stock\nquadrupled under his tenure, while sales more than doubled.  Verrier, 50, then took the helm at BorgWarner. Verrier has\nbeen with the company for 24 years. His prior positions have\nincluded vice president of BorgWarner\u2019s turbo systems and\npassenger-car products based in Germany. He was named chief\noperating officer in March 2012.  The CEO declined an interview request, said Erika Nielsen,\na company spokeswoman.  Verrier\u2019s Task  Verrier inherits a company that\u2019s not flying as high as it\nwas just recently. The stock has slipped 7.4 percent in the 12\nmonths ended yesterday. BorgWarner this month has traded at a\ndiscount to the North American Parts Index for the first time\nsince July 2011, according to weekly data compiled by Bloomberg.  Europe is the culprit. Vehicle sales in the region are\nheaded to the lowest level in 19 years because of the region\u2019s\nsovereign-debt crisis. BorgWarner\u2019s European sales began to\nslump six years ago and the drop accelerated over the past two.\nIn 2011, 56 percent of its sales were in Europe; now it\u2019s 51\npercent.  While BorgWarner\u2019s competitors also have been hurt by the\nEuropean slump, a larger percentage of BorgWarner\u2019s sales are\nthere. Cummins\u2019 auto-parts unit, for example, gets about 17\npercent of its revenue from Europe and the  Middle East .  Because of BorgWarner\u2019s success over the past three years,\nStover, for one, is taking a wait-and-see attitude.  \u2018Real Question\u2019  \u201cI\u2019m not saying they can\u2019t continue it, but the conditions\nare always more challenging when the expectations are higher,\u201d\nStover said. \u201cThe real question is what are the longer term\nsources of growth for BorgWarner and how is the company going to\nprotect its margins.\u201d  Stover says \u201cthe market is quietly betting against them.\u201d  David Leiker , an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Co., has a\nhold on the stock.  \u201cThe reality is the last 18 months have been a bit of a\nstruggle,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cBorgWarner is a fantastic\ncompany with great technology. The struggle has been that the\nvaluation has gotten ahead of the earnings growth,\u201d though he\nadded, \u201cI think that\u2019s coming to an end.\u201d  Manganello will remain as executive chairman until he steps\ndown at BorgWarner\u2019s April 24 annual meeting.  \u201cThe last five to seven years have been really special for\nthe company,\u201d Stover said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of unfair in a way for\nVerrier. The hardest thing to do is upstage an act like the one\nwe\u2019ve seen.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMark Clothier in Southfield, Michigan at \n mclothier@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJamie Butters at \n jbutters@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Cummins Inc. was 93.4884262084961 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Cummins Inc. was ",
