 "context": "The following article called 'Schneiderman Won\u2019t Seek Damages From Ex-AIG CEO Greenberg' was published on 2013-04-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNew York  Attorney General Eric Schneiderman told a court he won\u2019t pursue damages against ex-\n American International Group Inc. (AIG)  Chief Executive Officer\nMaurice \u201cHank\u201d Greenberg in a lawsuit dating back to 2005.  The state will still seek a court ruling banning Greenberg\nfrom participating in the securities industry or serving as an\nofficer or director of a public company, according to a letter\nNew York Solicitor General Barbara Underwood sent yesterday to\nthe clerk of the New York State Court of Appeals.  Greenberg in the appellate court case is challenging the\nattorney general\u2019s legal standing to seek damages for allegedly\nfraudulent reinsurance transactions. Underwood\u2019s letter said it\nwas sent in response to an inquiry by the court as to how\nGreenberg\u2019s settlement of a federal shareholder lawsuit would\naffect the appellate case.  \u201cAttorney General Schneiderman feels strongly that\nindividuals in the financial services industry who perpetrate\nfraud, no matter how wealthy or powerful, must be held publicly\naccountable, and that is why we believe justice will best be\nserved by proceeding to a long overdue trial of Mr. Greenberg as\nquickly as possible,\u201d  Damien LaVera , a spokesman for the\nattorney general, said in an e-mailed statement.  2005 Lawsuit  In the 2005 suit, the state accused Greenberg and former\nAIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith of using sham\ntransactions to distort New York-based AIG\u2019s reported financial\ncondition.  David Boies , Greenberg\u2019s lawyer, said in an e-mail\nyesterday he was pleased with the attorney general\u2019s decision to\ndrop the damages claims. Boies said in a letter to the appeals\ncourt today that the case should be dismissed entirely, arguing\nthat the claims Schneiderman is now pursuing were long ago\nabandoned.  \u201cNYAG has had eight years, millions of pages of documents,\nand unlimited depositions to try to develop evidence of\nappellants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNothing is served\nby further prolonging this case.\u201d  This month, a federal judge in New York approved a $115\nmillion settlement between  AIG shareholders  and former AIG\nexecutives, including Greenberg and Smith.  The plaintiffs, led by a group of Ohio public pension\nfunds, sued in 2004 and 2005, claiming the defendants misstated\ntheir involvement in alleged market-division and bid-rigging\nschemes and also misled investors about an alleged accounting\nfraud at AIG that resulted in the company\u2019s restating $3.9\nbillion of  earnings . A later restatement reduced the amount to\n$3.4 billion.  The lower-court case is State of New York v. Greenberg,\n401720-2005, New York State Supreme Court, New York County\n( Manhattan ).
