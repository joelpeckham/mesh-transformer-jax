 "context": "The following article called 'Appaloosa Said to Hold USAirways, AMR Stakes Amid Talks' was published on 2012-09-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAppaloosa Management LP has\npositioned itself to benefit from a possible merger between\nbankrupt AMR Corp. and  US Airways  Group Inc. after taking stakes\nin both airlines, three people familiar with the matter said.  While the hedge fund run by  David Tepper  isn\u2019t lobbying for\na tie-up, it favors consolidation and may opt later to push for\na deal, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified\nbecause the matter is private. Appaloosa is US Airways\u2019 top\nshareholder and has amassed AMR debt that could be converted to\nequity in a Chapter 11 restructuring, court records show.  Owning US Airways stock and AMR debt gives the $15 billion\ninvestment firm an opening to sway both sides of a potential\ncombination that would form the world\u2019s largest airline. AMR\ndismissed the idea of a merger for months before agreeing in May\nto weigh options besides its stand-alone bankruptcy-exit plan.  With a strategy like Appaloosa\u2019s \u201cyou either insure you\nwin or that you don\u2019t lose by being on both sides of a deal,\u201d\nFred Lowrance, an Avondale Partners LLC analyst in Nashville,\n Tennessee , said today in an interview. \u201cNo matter the outcome\nit\u2019s going to be positive for one of them.\u201d  The stakes are part of Appaloosa\u2019s bet on an industry\nrebound as  consumer spending  recovers and fuel costs drop, one\nof the people said. Its holdings as of June 30 included stock in\n United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) , the\nonly U.S. carriers bigger than AMR\u2019s  American Airlines .  Backing Consolidation  Appaloosa has supported airline mergers because past\ncombinations have boosted shares, the person said. The firm has\nshared that view in discussions with executives at Tempe,\nArizona-based US Airways and with others, the person said.  US Airways Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker began\npressing for a merger in January, while  Fort Worth , Texas-based\nAMR has resisted. AMR holds the exclusive right to offer a\nreorganization plan through year-end, so US Airways hasn\u2019t made\na formal bid.  US Airways declined to comment on Appaloosa, said Ed Stewart, a spokesman. Mike Trevino, an AMR spokesman, said the\nairline doesn\u2019t discuss \u201cthe actions of investors.\u201d Two calls\nto Appaloosa for comment this week weren\u2019t returned.  Merger speculation has helped  Short Hills , New Jersey-based\nAppaloosa and other investors in US Airways stock and AMR debt.\nUS Airways, the fifth-biggest U.S. airline, has more than\ndoubled this year. The shares slipped 0.1 percent to $10.67 at\nthe close in  New York  as most U.S. carriers declined.  Bonds Gain  AMR\u2019s $460 million of 6.25 percent convertible notes due\nOctober 2014 traded at 67.75 cents on the dollar at 2:14 p.m.\nNew York time, compared with 17.75 cents after the airline\u2019s\nNov. 29 bankruptcy filing, according to Trace, the bond-price\nreporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Appaloosa has \u201cidentified this as probably the last major\nround of airline consolidation,\u201d said Avondale\u2019s Lowrance, who\nhas a market outperform rating on US Airways. \u201cThey know\nairlines well, and want to be a part of it.\u201d  The firm has looked to a bankrupt company for returns\nbefore. Appaloosa agreed to buy the former  Delphi Corp. (DLPH)  out of\ncourt protection before backing out of a $2.55 billion agreement\nin 2008, saying the auto-parts supplier failed to meet terms of\ntheir accord. Delphi later sued Appaloosa and the parties\nreached an undisclosed settlement.  Largest Shareholder  Appaloosa added 2.27 million US Airways shares as of June\n30, filings show, raising its ownership to 12.9 million shares,\nor about 8 percent. Appaloosa also bought claims at AMR from\nCitigroup Inc. tied to aircraft leases, bankruptcy documents\nshow. The hedge fund holds additional AMR debt the firm isn\u2019t\nrequired to disclose and is one of the larger debt holders, the\npeople familiar with the matter said.  Besides AMR and US Airways, Appaloosa also owned at least\n2.9 percent of United, 1.1 percent of Delta and 0.3 percent of\n JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU) , according to regulatory filings as of\nJune 30.  Other US Airways shareholders also have bought  AMR (AAMRQ)  debt.  Marathon Asset Management LP, US Airways\u2019 fifth-largest\nequity investor, owns special facilities revenue bonds issued to\nfinance AMR\u2019s acquisition, construction and improvement of\nairport facilities, court papers show.  Shares, Debt  Cyrus Capital Partners LP, another US Airways shareholder,\nowns AMR debt as well. Cyrus is among a group of 12 creditors\nthat is negotiating with AMR about potential financing for its\nbankruptcy restructuring. Cyrus\u2019s holdings include $37.9 million\nof the 6.25 percent notes and $71.6 million of 7.5 percent notes\ndue in March 2016, court papers show.  AMR debt holders began organizing at least as far back as\nMay into groups outside its unsecured creditors committee to\ndetermine whether the bankrupt carrier or US Airways would offer\nthe best return. Joining such ad hoc groups gives the unsecured\ndebt holders more leverage since they aren\u2019t part of the panel\ncreated by the  bankruptcy court  to represent all AMR creditors.  Last month, an AMR creditor group including JPMorgan Chase\n& Co., Claren Road Asset Management LLC, Pentwater Capital\nManagement LP and King Street Capital Management LP said it was\ninterested in providing financing for the company\u2019s\nrestructuring.  Some individual bondholders have met with US Airways to\nreview their plan for a merged carrier, and one ad hoc group in\nJune agreed with AMR CEO  Tom Horton \u2019s request that they study\nhis stand-alone plan before reviewing US Airways\u2019 merger\nproposal, people familiar with the matter said at that time.  While Horton initially said he wanted the airline to leave\nbankruptcy independently and then consider mergers, he later\nagreed to consider potential tie-ups while under court\nprotection. AMR in July sent agreements for an exchange of\nconfidential financial and operational data to US Airways and\nother potential partners it didn\u2019t name publicly.  Parker has said US Airways is the only partner that can\nsolve AMR\u2019s network weaknesses, including boosting market share\nalong the U.S. East Coast and Midwest and adding hub airports\nthat would connect passengers to more cities across the country.
