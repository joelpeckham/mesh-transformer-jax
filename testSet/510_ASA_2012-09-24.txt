Sevan slumped as much as 11 percent, the biggest intraday\ndecline since Oct. 4, and traded down 8.2 percent at 5.86 kroner\nas of 12:27 p.m. local time. It was the third-biggest loser on\nthe Oslo Stock Exchange\u2019s  All-Share Index. (OSEAX)   Sevan had \u201cproblems\u201d while testing the control system of\na blowout preventer on its Sevan Brasil vessel, and will bring\nthe valve to the surface to investigate and make repairs, it\nsaid today in a statement. The equipment is used to cope with\nerratic pressure and flow when pumping from an underwater field.  \u201cThere should be at least seven days of downtime even if\nno issues are discovered,\u201d Pareto Securities ASA said in a note\nto clients.
