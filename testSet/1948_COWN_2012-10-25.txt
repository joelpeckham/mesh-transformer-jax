The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe pace of mergers and acquisitions\nwill become \u201cmore robust\u201d in 2013 after this year\u2019s decline,\nsaid Blair Effron, a co-founder of the Centerview Partners LLC\nadvisory boutique.  \u201cBased on the dialogue we see among companies, I don\u2019t\nnecessarily see companies, long-term, wanting to sit on their\nhands,\u201d Effron said today at the Bloomberg  Dealmakers Summit  in\nNew York. Clients at Effron\u2019s New York-based firm have included\nPepsiCo Inc. and News Corp.  Companies have announced $1.75 trillion in deals this year,\nor about 13 percent less than the $2.02 trillion at the same\npoint in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Activity\nrose in the previous two years as economies around the world\nemerged from recession.  \u201cAs sort of a day-to-day banker, it doesn\u2019t feel like a\ndown time,\u201d said Jonathan Knee of New York-based  Evercore\nPartners Inc. (EVR) , the author of \u201cThe Accidental Investment\nBanker.\u201d \u201cIt feels like a time when everybody is looking at\neverything.\u201d  In the U.S., there have been $662 billion of transactions\nin 2012, or 20 percent less than during the same period last\nyear. Peter Solomon, founder of New York-based Peter J. Solomon\nCo., said concerns about the strength of the U.S. recovery will\npush companies to make purchases to spur revenue.  Seeking Growth  \u201cYou have to acquire today to grow,\u201d said Solomon, whose\nfirm has advised clients including Walgreen Co. and PVH Corp.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not growth in the American economy.\u201d  U.S. prospects, however, may look brighter from a distance.\nSteven Baronoff, the head of M&A at  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , said\ncompanies outside the U.S. are pursuing acquisitions here\nbecause its economic growth prospects are stronger compared with\nmany other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very attractive market compared to  Europe ,\u201d\nBaronoff said in a separate panel discussion at the Dealmakers\nSummit today.  The transactions taking place now tend to involve top-\nquality assets, said Jeffrey Solomon, head of  Cowen Group Inc. (COWN) \u2019s\nbrokerage subsidiary. Just as investors in equity markets are\nchasing the safety of low-risk, dividend-paying stocks,\nacquirers in the M&A market are only willing to do quality deals\nwith less risk, he said.  \u201cPeople are crowding around the best assets,\u201d Solomon\nsaid.
