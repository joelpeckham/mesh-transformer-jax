 "context": "The following article called 'Tesoro California Plant Swap Proposed as Antitrust Antidote' was published on 2012-10-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIntensifying regulatory scrutiny of\nrecord gasoline prices in  California  may force  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  to\nsell its Los Angeles-area refinery to complete a $1.18 billion\npurchase of a larger  BP Plc (BP/)  plant in the state.  Tesoro proposed selling its 97,000 barrel-a-day Wilmington\nrefinery to overcome any government antitrust opposition to the\nacquisition, according to a company filing. Adding BP\u2019s 266,000\nbarrel-a-day Carson refinery would double Tesoro\u2019s California\nmarket share, making it the state\u2019s largest crude processor with\ncontrol of 25 percent of refining capacity, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  As gasoline prices in the state soared amid refinery and\npipeline outages, both of California\u2019s U.S. senators requested\nfederal investigations yesterday, a state senator called for\nhearings and a consumer watchdog group asked state Attorney\nGeneral  Kamala Harris  to block Tesoro\u2019s deal with BP. Harris is\nreviewing the acquisition for its potential market impact.  \u201cAdequate competition is crucial to keep gasoline prices\nas low as possible,\u201d Harris said in an e-mail message\nyesterday.  \u201cTesoro remains confident that once all the facts are in,\nthe data will support regulatory approval of the transaction,\u201d\nTina Barbee, a spokeswoman for Tesoro, said in an e-mail\nyesterday.  \u201cWe believe the transaction is pro-competitive,\u201d said\n Scott Dean , a BP spokesman. The deal is expected to close by the\nmiddle of 2013, according to the companies.  Tesoro, based in San Antonio, is buying BP\u2019s Carson\nrefinery along with an import-export terminal and 800 retail\nstations across the Southwest. The purchase would put 63 percent\nof the state\u2019s refinery capacity under the control of Tesoro,\n Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Antitrust Solution  In anticipation of antitrust concerns around its Carson\npurchase, Tesoro agreed to sell or otherwise dispose of the\nWilmington refinery if regulators tried to block the deal,\naccording to the purchase and sale agreement between BP and\nTesoro filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on\nAug. 13.  If Tesoro sold the Wilmington plant to keep Carson, the\ncompany would sacrifice its plans to integrate the two\nrefineries. Combining the plants\u2019 operations would cut costs and\nreduce  carbon emissions  at Wilmington by at least 30 percent,\nChief Executive Officer Gregory Goff said Aug. 18 when the deal\nwas announced.  California has forced a refinery divestiture in the past as\na condition of approving an acquisition. In 1999, Exxon Corp.\n agreed to sell  its Benicia refinery to Valero in order to win\napproval from then-California Attorney General Bill Lockyer of\nits $79.9 billion merger with Mobil Corp.  Price Trigger  \u201cThere was a concern that the new entity would have too\nmuch market influence by having a refinery in  San Francisco  and\nBenicia, so they had to divest of Benicia and sell several\nhundred service stations,\u201d Harold York, principal analyst for\noil research at Wood Mackenzie Ltd. in Houston, said in a\ntelephone interview yesterday. \u201cThe recent rise in gasoline\nprices illustrates why the attorney general looks at these sorts\nof issues.\u201d  The Federal Trade Commission will have the final say on\nwhether Tesoro\u2019s Carson purchase is approved. The agency will\nlook \u201cvery seriously\u201d at the California attorney general\u2019s\nconcerns, York said.  Peter Kaplan , a spokesman for the FTC, declined to comment.  Tesoro, which rose to the highest level in more than four\nyears on the day the purchase was announced, may have to pay\nLondon-based BP a $150 million penalty if the transaction\ndoesn\u2019t close, according to the purchase agreement. Tesoro fell\n0.3 percent to $38.59 at the close in  New York .  Consumer Opposition  Consumer Watchdog , a California advocacy group that calls\nfor lower gasoline prices, asked Harris to reject the\ntransaction.  \u201cCalifornia\u2019s drivers and the state economy will pay the\nprice for this merger at the pump,\u201d Consumer Watchdog wrote\nHarris in a letter yesterday. \u201cWe ask you to halt it on\nantitrust grounds.\u201d  California gasoline prices leaped to an all-time high of\n$4.671 a gallon Oct. 9, according to data from AAA, the nation\u2019s\nlargest motoring organization. Prices rose 50 cents last week\nafter an Exxon Mobil Los-Angeles area refinery reduced\nproduction Oct. 1 because of a  power failure .  That followed the September shutdown of a Chevron pipeline\nand an August fire at Chevron\u2019s Richmond, California refinery.\nChevron fell 4.2 percent, the most in almost a year, to $112.45\nat the close in New York yesterday after announcing that a crude\nunit in the 240,000 barrel-a-day refinery will remain offline\nuntil the end of the year.  Investigations Multiply  U.S. Senator  Dianne Feinstein  asked the Federal Trade\nCommission to investigate the price spikes and U.S. Senator\n Barbara Boxer  asked the  Department of Justice  to do the same.\nBoth senators are California Democrats. State Senator Mark Leno\nsaid he intended to hold a legislative hearing on the matter.  The state\u2019s \u201cprice squeeze\u201d will lead regulators to\nscrutinize the deal more thoroughly,  David Hackett , president of\nStillwater Associates LLC, an  Irvine , California-based energy\nconsulting firm, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Tesoro would probably struggle to find a buyer for its\nWilmington plant, which shares a fenceline with BP\u2019s larger\nCarson refinery, in the event regulators block the deal, Hackett\nsaid.  \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who would buy Tesoro Wilmington,\u201d\nHackett said.  Cutting Emissions  California is aiming to cut the state\u2019s greenhouse-gas\nemissions by implementing a cap-and-trade system and requiring a\n10 percent reduction of the carbon intensity of transportation\nfuels sold by 2020.  The latter law, dubbed a \u201clow-carbon fuel standard,\u201d\nwould raise costs for refiners and could force four to six\nrefineries in the state to close, erasing as much as 30 percent\nof the state\u2019s refining capacity and triggering gasoline\nshortages as early as 2015, according to a June industry-funded\nstudy by the  Boston Consulting Group .  \u201cThis market is not for everyone,\u201d Amy Myers Jaffe,\nexecutive director of energy and sustainability at the\n University of California , Davis, said yesterday in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cCalifornians are going to have to choose between\nthe ideal environmental regulations and prices.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nBradley Olson in Houston at \n bradleyolson@bloomberg.net ;\nDan Murtaugh in Houston at \n dmurtaugh@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSusan Warren at \n susanwarren@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Chevron Corporation was 76.38219451904297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Chevron Corporation was ",
