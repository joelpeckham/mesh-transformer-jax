Fuller was hired in August 2012 after an executive search.\nUnlike some other states\u2019 public retirement systems, New York\u2019s pension is well-funded. The two main systems that comprise the fund were nearly 95 percent and 94 percent funded as of March 2017, according to the most recent annual financial report.\nUnder Fuller\u2019s tenure, the New York\u2019s system has \u201cled the nation as one of the best managed public pension funds,\u201d DiNapoli said in a statement.\nIt has had an average annual growth rate of more than 8.75 percent, he said.\n\u201cVicki\u2019s creative and strong leadership leaves us with an excellent management team and increased operating efficiencies,\u201d he said, noting that she had helped integrate environmental, social and governance factors into the state\u2019s investment process.\nFuller said in the statement that her colleagues at the fund \u201chave been an inspiration and an extraordinarily dedicated team of talented and genuinely nice people.\u201d\nShe said there were several goals she wanted to pursue but did not elaborate.
