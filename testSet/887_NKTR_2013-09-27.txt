The pound advanced against most major\ncurrencies as Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  told a U.K.\nnewspaper he does not support increasing asset purchases.\nItalian bonds and European shares slid following a debt auction.  The  U.S. Senate  voted to finance the government through\nNov. 15 after removing language to choke off funding for the\nhealth care law, putting pressure on the House to avoid a\nfederal shutdown set to start Oct. 1. Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York President William C. Dudley said budget battles in\n Washington  are among risks to the economic outlook.  \u201cThe data does seem to be seeing some improvement here,\nbut with the overhang from Washington, that clouds the outlook\nfor the immediate future,\u201d Derek Hamilton, a global economist\nat Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. in  Overland Park ,  Kansas , said\nin a phone interview. His firm manages $114 billion. \u201cIf we do\nhave an extended government shutdown, and more importantly, an\ninability to pass the debt ceiling raise, that will probably\nhave a fairly significant impact on the stock market.\u201d  Data Watch  The  S&P 500  extended its weekly decline to 1.1 percent,\nsnapping a three-week rally. The benchmark index is up 5.3\npercent in the third quarter and 19 percent in 2013.

Debates in Congress on how to fund the government for\nthe next fiscal year and raising the debt ceiling \u201ccreates\nuncertainty about the fiscal outlook and may exert a restraining\ninfluence on household and business spending,\u201d Dudley said\ntoday in the text of remarks in Syracuse, New York.  The vote in the Senate today set up a weekend of\nnegotiating that could continue until spending authority expires\non Sept. 30.

Italy \u2019s\nRome-based Treasury sold 3 billion euros of the 2024 bonds at an\naverage yield of 4.5 percent, more than the 4.46 percent at a\nprevious auction on Aug. 29.  Auction \u2018Weak\u2019  Italy\u2019s government bonds fell amid speculation that traders\nwho deal directly with the Treasury had to hold on to most of\nthe securities on offer at today\u2019s auction as political tension\ndeterred other buyers.  \u201cThe Italian auction was weak,\u201d said  Harvinder Sian , a\nsenior fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group\nPlc in  London . \u201cThe issue is that it was a dealer-led affair\nand there wasn\u2019t much real money buying.

The five permanent members of the UN Security Council\nagreed on a resolution to find and destroy Syria\u2019s chemical\nweapons.
