 "context": "The following article called 'Panda Cam Working Again as U.S. Government Restarts' was published on 2013-10-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe e-mails went out to federal\nemployees shortly after President  Barack Obama  signed the bill\nfunding the government: Report to work.  The 11th-hour budget deal Congress struck yesterday raised\nthe nation\u2019s debt limit and ended the 16-day government shutdown\nthat had sent hundreds of thousands of federal employees home\nwithout pay. Now they\u2019re flooding back to work.  \u201cMost employees are back or they\u2019re on their way back,\u201d\nColleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees\nUnion, said at a press conference today in Washington. Agencies\ncalled many workers back immediately, giving them a \u201creasonable\namount of time\u201d to report -- typically within four hours of\nreceiving notice that the government is once again open for\nbusiness, she said.  From the halls of America\u2019s bureaucracies to its national\nparks, federal workers are discovering that returning to their\njobs after being furloughed for more than two weeks isn\u2019t as\neasy as simply showing up and turning on the lights.  For some departments, starting up will be even harder than\nshutting down, and it may be weeks or even months before the\ngovernment resumes issuing loans, payments and contracts at a\nnormal pace.  \u2018Disruptive\u2019  \u201cThis has been very disruptive,\u201d Larry Allen, president\nof Allen Federal Business Partners, a contract consulting firm\nin McLean,  Virginia , said in an interview. \u201cThe shock wave will\nlast for months.\u201d  Kelley -- whose union represents 150,000 federal employees\nat 31 agencies including the Treasury and Commerce Departments -\n- said one of the biggest impacts of the shutdown stems from the\ntemporary halt in the IRS\u2019s tax collection efforts.  President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration estimated that the\ncountry lost about $100 million for each day the IRS\u2019s\ncollection activities weren\u2019t operating during a previous\ngovernment shutdown. While no current assessment is available,\nit\u2019s clear from the past experience that the temporary loss to\nthe Treasury is extensive, Kelley said.  By foot, car, subway, and bus, the workers came back to\noffices in the capital they closed two and a half weeks ago to\nstart the process of re-opening the government. Vice President\nJoe Biden greeted federal workers returning to the Environmental\nProtection Agency headquarters on 12th Street in downtown\n Washington .  The National Zoo\u2019s popular \u201c panda cam \u201d was turned back on\nthis morning, providing streaming video of a baby panda in\nWashington. The web page provides live views of the 8-week-old\ncub and her mother.  Debt Deal  Last night\u2019s legislation funds the government through mid-January and raises the nation\u2019s $16.7 billion debt limit, ending\nfor now the threat of default, which economists had warned could\npush the U.S. back into a recession.  Federal agencies were instructed to begin opening offices\ntoday in a \u201cprompt and orderly manner,\u201d according to a memo\nfrom OMB Director Sylvia Burwell that cleared furloughed\nemployees to return to work. \u201cWe will work closely with\ndepartments and agencies to make the transition back to full\noperating status as smooth as possible,\u201d she said.  The budget agreement reopens closed parks and barricaded\nmonuments that had forced tourists to cancel trips and hurt\nnearby businesses that rely on the traffic.  Workers who had to scrimp to cover the loss of pay received\ngood news: Their next checks on Oct. 25 will cover the full 80-hours. Agencies said retroactive pay covering the first shutdown\nweek would be made as soon as possible.  \u2018Cranking Machine\u2019  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which furloughed\nall but 300 of its 3,900 person staff, will have to reschedule\npublic meetings, including those with companies including\n Southern Co. (SO) ,  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  and the Nuclear\nEnergy Institute, a Washington-based industry group, which were\ncanceled during the shutdown.  \u201cWe are literally just cranking the machine back up,\u201d\nScott Burnell, an agency spokesman said in a phone interview.\nWhile the NRC didn\u2019t lay off its resident inspectors at U.S.\nreactors during the shutdown, it did stop updating its daily\nreport of incidents at the units. Those will be posted\nretroactively, Burnell said.  As of this morning, the NRC was making adjustments to\naccommodate its workers who may have gotten late the order to\nreturn to work.  \u201cSupervisors are strongly encouraged to grant leave,\ntelework, or work schedule flexibilities to help ensure a smooth\ntransition back to work for employees,\u201d said a notice on the\nagency\u2019s website.  \u2018Different Now\u2019  The partial halt in government operations was shorter than\nthe budget shutdowns in fiscal 1996 that lasted a total of 26\ndays.  This year\u2019s disruption has been far broader in scope, said\nBarry Anderson, who was assistant director of the White House\nOffice of Management and Budget during the fiscal 1996 shutdown.  Congress had  completed  seven of its 13 annual\nappropriations bills funding agencies in the previous stoppage -\n- leaving vast parts of the government still working. This time\nnot a single agency funded at Congress\u2019s discretion had final\nbudget approval.  \u201cThings are very different now,\u201d Anderson said.  The 16-day halt in operations at many federal agencies took\nan estimated $24 billion out of the U.S. economy, Standard &\nPoor\u2019s said yesterday.  The cost of restarting the government is hard to tabulate.\nA study conducted by the OMB after the fiscal 1996 shutdown\npegged the closing\u2019s cost at $1.4 billion, or about $2 billion\nin today\u2019s money. That figure didn\u2019t include costs incurred when\nworkers returned, though those expenses were termed\n\u201csignificant\u201d by John Koskinen, deputy director of management\nat OMB during the previous shutdown, during a hearing of the\nHouse Subcommittee on Civil Service in December 1996.  Uncounted Costs  \u201cSignificant additional costs, that cannot be determined\nat this time, include interest payments to third parties\u201d when\nthe government doesn\u2019t pay its bills on time, he said. \u201cThere\nwill also be additional personnel costs necessary to deal with\nthe backlog of work resulting from the shutdown.\u201d  Those expenditures may be billions of dollars, said  Charles\nTiefer , a law professor at the University of Baltimore who has\nstudied shutdowns.  While he is aware of no study that has calculated the cost\nof restarting the government, Tiefer said the biggest line items\nlikely include the inability of agencies to carefully audit the\nhuge backlog of payments including those to the IRS and Medicare\nclaims. Others come from the difficulty of health and safety\nregulators such as the Environmental Protection Agency to pick\nup unresolved investigations, he said.  \u201cWhen they resume their work, the trail will be cold, and\nthe work lost,\u201d Tiefer said in an interview. \u201cThat is by far\nthe most costly.\u201d  Morale Damaged  It may also hurt morale. In her message, Health and Human\nServices Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sought to reassure even\nthose employees who were furloughed that they serve important\nroles.  \u201cFor those of you returning to work today, we missed you\nand welcome back,\u201d Sebelius wrote. \u201cThank you for\nunderstanding that your status was based on a technical\nstatutory definition mostly determined by how your work is\nfunded, and not the value we attribute to the important work you\ndo each and every day here at the Department.\u201d  \u201cTo those returning from furlough: know that the work you\nperform is incredibly valued by your military teammates and by\nme,\u201d Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a message to\nemployees.  The Pentagon had already recalled to work most of the\n350,000 civilian employees it originally sent home. Even so,\nHagel called the shutdown a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d that was an\n\u201cunwelcome and unnecessary distraction.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nLaura Litvan in Washington at \n llitvan@bloomberg.net ;\nJim Snyder in Washington at \n jsnyder24@bloomberg.net ;\nAllan Holmes in Washington at \n aholmes25@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJon Morgan at \n jmorgan97@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of National Research Corporation was 15.675987243652344 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of National Research Corporation was ",
