 "context": "The following article called 'Railroads, Juniper, Health Law, Harbinger: Compliance' was published on 2013-08-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe four largest U.S. railroad\ncompanies won their bid to reverse a ruling that turned a price-fixing lawsuit against them by shippers into a group lawsuit\nwith potential damages of at least $10 billion.  A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in\nWashington Aug. 9 threw out a decision by a lower-court judge\ncertifying the class, sending it back for him to reconsider in\nlight of a subsequent Supreme Court ruling on class\ncertification. The lower court also used a flawed model for\ndetermining potential harm to shippers, the panel said.  \u201cMindful that the district court neither considered the\ndamages model\u2019s flaw in its certification decision nor had the\nbenefit\u201d of the Supreme Court case, \u201cwe will vacate class\ncertification and remand the case to the district court to\nafford it an opportunity to consider these issues,\u201d U.S.\nCircuit Judge  Janice Rogers Brown  wrote for the panel.  The suit, brought in 2007 by  Olin Corp. (OLN)  and seven other\ncompanies that ship goods by rail, alleges the railroad\noperators colluded at an industry meeting in 2003 to impose a\nsurcharge tied to total transportation costs rather than to\nactual fuel prices during a 3 1/2-year period.  U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman last year certified a\nclass of about 30,000 shippers in a case against  Union Pacific\nCorp. (UNP) , the largest U.S. carrier by revenues; Burlington Northern\nSanta Fe, a unit of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,\nthe number two freight carrier; and  CSX Corp. (CSX)  and Norfolk\nSouthern Corp.  \u201cWhile this obviously was not our preferred outcome, we\nare gratified that the case was remanded,\u201d Stephen Neuwirth, of\nQuinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, co-lead counsel for the\nshippers, said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cWe are confident that\nwe will be able to demonstrate that the damages model in fact\nsatisfies the highest standards that have been set by the\ncourts, and that ultimately the case will move forward as a\nclass action.\u201d  Tom Lange, a spokesman for Union Pacific, said in a\nstatement that the company is \u201cpleased with the court\u2019s\ndecision and looks forward to the opportunity to reaffirm that\nUnion Pacific\u2019s fuel surcharge program complied with the\napplicable legal requirements.\u201d  The case is In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust\nLitigation, 12-07085, U.S. Court of Appeals, District of\nColumbia (Washington).

Compliance Policy  ASIC Increases Disclosure Requirements for Dark Trading Systems  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission\nupdated disclosure requirements in an e-mailed statement, with\nrules that will come into force over nine months.  Crossing-system operators must report to ASIC if they\nidentify suspicious activity, and activity on their crossing\nsystem must be monitored from Nov. 10.  \u201cWe expect the new rules will quickly lead to changes in\nthe behavior of market participants, building on the positive\nchanges we have already seen with other recent rule changes and\nthe work of ASIC\u2019s taskforces on dark liquidity and high-frequency trading,\u201d ASIC Commissioner Cathie Armour wrote in an\ne-mailed statement.  Compliance Action  U.S. Said to Plan Charges Against Former JPMorgan Employees  The U.S. may announce charges as early as this week against\nformer London-based  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  employees related to\nallegations they tried to conceal losses last year, a person\nfamiliar with the matter said.  The situation remains fluid and it isn\u2019t clear who may be\ncharged, said the person, who requested anonymity because the\ninformation wasn\u2019t public. Those facing U.S. charges include\nJavier Martin-Artajo, a Spaniard who lives in London and a\nformer executive who oversaw the trading strategy, and Julien\nGrout, a French citizen and a trader who worked for him, the  New\nYork Times (NYT)  reported Aug. 9. Prosecutors also are weighing\npenalties for the bank, including a fine and a reprimand, the\nnewspaper said in a subsequent report.  The investigation has centered on whether employees at\nJPMorgan\u2019s chief investment office attempted to inflate the\nvalue of trades on the bank\u2019s books by mismarking them, a person\nwith knowledge of the matter said previously. Federal officials\nare considering charges related to mismarking books and\nfalsifying documents, the person said.  Edward Little , an attorney for Grout, said his client moved\nback to France before media reports last week about the\npotential charges and that he has no intention of fleeing, the\nNew York Times reported late yesterday.  The bank first disclosed losses at its London office in May\n2012 after what Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  called\n\u201cegregious mistakes\u201d in managing credit-derivative positions.\nThe trades by Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because of\nthe size of his holdings, eventually caused more than $6.2\nbillion of losses for the company.

(JNPR)  fell the most in more than three\nmonths after disclosing that it\u2019s being investigated for\npossible violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  The shares fell 5.6 percent to $20.92 at the close on Aug.\n9. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nDepartment of Justice are both conducting investigations, the\nSunnyvale, California-based company disclosed in a filing Aug.\n8.  Juniper, the No. 2 maker of networking equipment, generated\nmore than half of its sales outside the U.S. in 2012, according\nto  data  compiled by Bloomberg. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\nprohibits U.S. companies from paying bribes to foreign officials\nto win business. The company is cooperating with the\ninvestigations and \u201ccan\u2019t predict the scope or duration,\u201d said\nMichael Busselen, a spokesman for Juniper.  John Nester , a spokesman for the SEC, and  Peter Carr , a\nJustice Department spokesman, declined to comment.  In many instances, companies are investigated under the\nFCPA because distributors or resellers don\u2019t have strong\ninternal controls to prevent bribery, according to  Jayson\nNoland , an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. in San Francisco.  For more, click here.  Obama Financial Fraud Task Force Takes On Banks Too Big to Fail  The criminal investigation of JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s\nmortgage-backed securities practice is evidence a U.S. Justice\nDepartment task force set up to investigate causes of the\nfinancial crisis is finally getting some traction against banks\nblamed for ruining the economy.  The probe, disclosed last week in the bank\u2019s quarterly\nfiling, is the latest enforcement effort to emerge from the\nResidential Mortgage Backed Securities Working Group. It was set\nup last year on orders of President Barack Obama to coordinate\nprosecutions of fraudulent underwriting activity by banks that\ncontributed to the financial crisis.  The JPMorgan probe, which is also looking at possible civil\nviolations, grew out of the working group\u2019s efforts, said Lauren\nHorwood, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in\nSacramento, who is leading the investigation and is a member of\nthe group\u2019s parent, the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force.  \u201cOver the last year and a half, the RMBS Working Group\nmembers have been aggressively investigating multiple cases\nacross the country and the public is only beginning to see the\nresults,\u201d Associate Attorney General  Tony West , the No. 3\nranking official at the Justice Department, said in an e-mail.  The JPMorgan Chase investigation, which may not lead to\ncriminal charges, follows parallel civil lawsuits filed earlier\nthis week by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nU.S. Attorney Office in Charlotte, North Carolina. U.S.\nofficials claim  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  failed to disclose risks\nembedded in $850 million in mortgage-backed securities issued in\n2008.  The RMBS group\u2019s director is Geoff Graber, who was also the\nlead Justice Department lawyer in the investigation of New York-based  McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) \u2019s S&P unit. More than 200\nfederal and state attorneys, investigators and analysts have\nplayed a role in the group\u2019s work, according to the Justice\nDepartment.  Graber\u2019s coordinating team, composed of eight members, is\nbased in Washington and made up of criminal prosecutors, civil\nattorneys and analysts. As part of its work, it conducts day-long meetings every two months, the most recent of which\noccurred on July 12, according to the Justice Department.  The group has faced criticism from lawmakers and consumer\nadvocates for its failure to live up to the promises President\nObama made when he announced its establishment in his January\n2012 State of the Union address. The pace of the group\u2019s work\ndrew early complaints from lawmakers.  For more, click here.  SAC Allowed by Judge to Keep Operating While Facing Charges  SAC Capital Advisors LP, the hedge fund owned by  Steven\nCohen  that is facing criminal charges and a civil money\nlaundering lawsuit, won a judge\u2019s approval of a business plan\nthat will allow the firm to continue operating during the cases.  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan on Aug. 9\nissued an order saying that federal prosecutors, who indicted\nthe firm July 25 in an insider-trading scheme and filed a suit\nagainst the Stamford, Connecticut-based fund, will avoid\ninterfering with SAC\u2019s legitimate operations.  The approved plan requires that SAC maintain at least 85\npercent of the \u201caggregate value\u201d of assets owned by the firm\u2019s\n\u201centity defendants\u201d as of July 1 and in exchange, allows for\nthe fund to continue its lawful operations. If the assets fall\nbelow the specified level in a given month, the fund is required\nto \u201creplenish\u201d the monies, according to the order.  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for SAC at Sard Verbinnen\n& Co., declined to comment on the filing.  Oregon Exchange Delay Adds to Scale-Down of Health Law Goals  Oregon, a Democratic-led state that has embraced President\n Barack Obama \u2019s Affordable Care Act, won\u2019t meet all the\nrequirements for its health-insurance exchange when the online\nmarketplace opens Oct. 1.  For at least two weeks, people using Cover Oregon won\u2019t be\nable to complete their purchase without help from a certified\ninsurance broker or community group, said Lisa Morawski, an\nexchange spokeswoman. Consumers in all 50 states were supposed\nto be able to freely shop for health plans on their own.  \u201cWe thought that this was an opportunity for us to open\nour doors on Oct. 1 with all the functionality, but not overload\nthe system,\u201d Morawski said Aug. 9 by telephone.  Oregon\u2019s step-back suggests that states don\u2019t have enough\ntime to comply with next year\u2019s core implementation of the 2010\nhealth law as Obama envisioned. Even the federal data services\nhub that is supposed to connect the exchanges may not get final\nsecurity certification until Sept. 30, the inspector general for\nthe Health and Human Services Department said April 5.  \u201cWith all of the delays -- the Supreme Court delay, the\nelection -- states and HHS for that matter simply don\u2019t have\nenough time to put this together as it should be,\u201d said Dan\nSchuyler, director of exchange technology at the consulting firm\nLeavitt Partners in Salt Lake City.  Oregon is one of 14 states building their own exchanges.\nThe federal government is doing most or all of the work in the\nremaining 36 states. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices, which is supervising the building of state exchanges,\nis aware of Oregon\u2019s plan and isn\u2019t concerned,  Brian Cook , an\nagency spokesman, said in an e-mail.

U.S. Regulator Issues Bitcoin-Related Subpoenas, WSJ Reports  New York\u2019s banking regulator issued subpoenas to about two\ndozen companies associated with bitcoin as it looks into the\nvirtual-currency industry, the Wall Street Journal reported,\nciting people familiar with the matter.  The subpoenas, issued by the  Department of Financial\nServices , seek information on topics including antimoney-laundering, consumer protection and investment strategies,\naccording to the report, which didn\u2019t identify the people. The\nsubpoenas were issued late last week, the Journal said.  The department is considering setting new guidelines aimed\nat virtual currencies, the newspaper reported, citing a memo\nfrom  Benjamin Lawsky , the agency\u2019s head. The memo, which the\nregulator plans to issue today, expresses concern that virtual-currency companies aren\u2019t complying with the state\u2019s money-transmission laws, according to the report.  Bitcoin is a virtual currency created four years ago that\ncan be used to buy and sell a broad array of items, from\nelectronics to illegal narcotics.  Coinsetter LLC, one of the companies cited in the report as\nhaving been issued a subpoena, said the dialogue with the\nregulator will have a positive effect on the industry, according\nto Chief Executive Officer Jaron Lukasiewicz. Lukasiewicz said\nthere had been no misbehavior toward consumers by the leading\nbitcoin companies.  \u201cU.S.-based Bitcoin companies are taking regulation very\nseriously, and each company is closely working with legal\nadvisers to form and follow plans that adhere to it,\u201d\nLukasiewicz said in an e-mail.  In the Courts  Cantor, Ex-Trader Exchange Suits Over Alleged Blackmail Threat  Cantor Fitzgerald  LP accused a fired Singapore-based\nderivatives trader of making a blackmail threat in an exchange\nof lawsuits between the brokerage and its former employee over\nhis dismissal.  Gavin White, the former trader, sued in Singapore\u2019s High\nCourt for wrongful dismissal, claiming unspecified damages.\nCantor, the New York-based independent broker-dealer,\ncountersued for a repayment of a loan and a return of a portion\nof his wages. A closed hearing is scheduled for Aug. 15.  White, who had refused a 20 percent pay cut proposal in\nOctober, had said he might complain about alleged breaches by\nthe brokerage in Australia, Cantor\u2019s Singapore unit said in its\ncounterclaim. Cantor denied there had been any breaches and said\nit had a right to fire him for gross misconduct. White\nthreatened to damage the firm\u2019s reputation, which amounted to a\nthreat of blackmail, the brokerage said.  \u201cMr. White strenuously denies that he made any such threat\nas alleged by Cantor,\u201d his lawyer Pradeep Pillai said in a\nphone interview. \u201cHe is eager to have his name cleared of the\nallegation of gross misconduct.\u201d  In addition to denying having made the statements\nattributed to him, White said that any comments he made in\nOctober meetings to discuss his pay with his supervisor weren\u2019t\nsupposed to be used against him. Cantor breached a three-year\nemployment contract by firing him in November, he said in the\ncomplaint.  Cantor proposed to cut White\u2019s pay in October because his\ndivision was underperforming and the brokerage couldn\u2019t sustain\nthe \u201cextremely high salaries\u201d on the team, the firm said in\ncourt papers.  White was paid S$580,000 ($461,000) a year at Cantor.\nCantor is seeking the return of S$297,576.  Robert Hubbell, a spokesman for Cantor, declined to comment\non the litigation.  The case is White v. Cantor Fitzgerald (Singapore) Capital\nMarkets Ltd. S139/2013. Singapore High Court.  UBS Agrees to Pay $120 Million to Settle Lehman Suit Claims  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland\u2019s largest bank, agreed to pay $120\nmillion to settle claims by investors in Lehman Brothers\nHoldings Inc. securities in a lawsuit tied to the investment\nbank\u2019s 2008 collapse.  UBS was accused of violating federal securities laws in\nunderwriting and selling the securities to investors, who\nclaimed that offering materials contained misleading information\nabout Lehman Brothers\u2019 financial condition.  \u201cUBS is pleased to have resolved this legacy litigation\nmatter arising out of the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d the Zurich-based lender said in a statement. \u201cUBS agreed to the settlement\nto avoid the cost and uncertainty of continued litigation.\u201d  The settlement, disclosed Aug. 8 in a filing in federal\ncourt in New York, compares \u201cfavorably\u201d with other recoveries\nstemming from the credit crisis, the plaintiffs said. Lehman\nBrothers filed for bankruptcy in September 2008.  The settlement, which requires court approval, represents a\nrecovery of 13.4 percent of the total face value of securities\nat issue, or about $896 million, without taking into account\nUBS\u2019s defenses and rights of offset, according to the court\nfiling.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Securities and Erisa\nLitigation, 09-md-02017, U.S. District Court, Southern District\nof New York (Manhattan).  N.Y. Federal Reserve Bomb Plotter Sentenced to 30 Years  A Bangladeshi man who tried to detonate what he thought was\na 1,000-pound bomb at the New York Federal Reserve was sentenced\nto 30 years in prison.  Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, 22, who was drawn into\nan undercover operation, was arrested in October after\nrepeatedly attempting to set off fake explosives provided to him\nby federal agents. He pleaded guilty in February and on Aug. 9\nwas sentenced by U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon in\nBrooklyn, New York, for attempting to use a weapon of mass\ndestruction.  \u201cI am persuaded that the defendant was a serious threat to\nthe safety of New Yorkers, of Americans,\u201d Amon said during a\nhearing, imposing a sentence that was at the lower end of a\nrecommended range of as much as life in prison.  On the day of his attempted bombing, while covering his\nface, wearing sunglasses and disguising his voice, Nafis had a\nfederal agent posing as a co-conspirator record a video\nstatement he made, saying \u201cWe will not stop until we attain\nvictory or martyrdom,\u201d according to a criminal complaint.  In the courtroom Aug. 9, Nafis, clean-shaven and wearing an\nover-sized khaki jail uniform, said he was grateful to the\nagents who caught him. He asked the judge to \u201cplease have mercy\non me.\u201d  The U.S. alleged that Nafis came to the U.S. in January\n2012 with the intention of carrying out a terrorist attack.\nAfter a brief period at Southeast Missouri State University, he\nwent to New York and tried to recruit others for his plot,\nprosecutors alleged.  His lawyer, Heidi Cesare, said Nafis has taken\nresponsibility for his actions and is unlikely to pose a future\nthreat.  The case is U.S. v. Nafis, 1:12-cr-00720, U.S. District\nCourt, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).  For more, click here.
