Cameron\u2019s \u201cAvatar\u201d holds the current record for ticket sales with $2.8 billion worldwide.\nThis weekend\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d from Walt Disney Co\u2019s Marvel Studios, is expected to rank among the top U.S. and Canadian openings of all time.\nIn the series called \u201cAMC Visionaries: James Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction,\u201d Cameron interviews fellow directors Steven Spielberg, Guillermo del Toro, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan about filmmaking and their influences.\nCameron traded notes with the directors on their favorite sci-fi literature from as far back as the 1930s, something he wanted to highlight as a key part of the genre\u2019s origins.\n\u201cWhat was important to me for this series was to trace back the DNA of these stories,\u201d Cameron said. \u201cSo if you\u2019ve got a time travel story, where did that come from? If you\u2019ve got a space story, how did that enter our popular culture? Why did science fiction as a genre struggle to try and popularize these ideas?\u201d\nCameron argued that science fiction is now more relevant than ever as humans become more dependent on machines.\n\u201cWe are co-evolving with our own technology,\u201d Cameron said.\n\u201cScience fiction is kind of our headlights. It helps us see what\u2019s down the road.\u201d Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Tom Brown\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. was 14.198555946350098 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. was ",
