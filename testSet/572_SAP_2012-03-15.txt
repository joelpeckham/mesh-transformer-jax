The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSalesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  introduced new\nsoftware for human-resources management, stepping up a challenge\nto  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  and  SAP AG (SAP)  in the market for applications that\nhelp businesses run their operations.  The new product, called Rypple, will work in conjunction\nwith Salesforce\u2019s customer relationship management software and\nthe Chatter social network for companies, Salesforce said today\nat its Cloudforce conference in  San Francisco . Managers will be\nable to recognize employees who do standout work using Rypple\nfeatures from within those applications, the company said.  Salesforce, the largest maker of online customer-management\nsoftware, specializes in programs delivered in installments over\nthe Internet, in contrast with the kinds of upfront purchases\nthat have been a mainstay for Oracle and SAP. Rypple, acquired\nin December from a company with the same name, will serve as an\nalternative to the applications SAP picked up through the $3.4\nbillion acquisition of  SuccessFactors Inc. (SFSF)  and those Oracle\ngained in 2005 when it bought PeopleSoft Inc.  \u201cWe need to bring the solutions into the workflow people\nuse in everyday life,\u201d John Wookey, who formerly worked at\nOracle and SAP and was hired by Salesforce in November, said in\nan interview. Salesforce also released software called Site.com\nto help marketing departments build Web campaigns.  Business Gets Social  \u201cI came on board with a simple mission -- to bring social\nmedia to the way companies operate,\u201d Wookey said. \u201cPart of\nthis is generational shifts that are happening in the\nworkplace.\u201d  Wookey spent a dozen years at Oracle and led development of\nthe company\u2019s new Fusion applications, which compete with\nSalesforce\u2019s software. He then worked at SAP from 2008 until\nlast year.  Salesforce espouses an approach called \u201csoftware as a\nservice\u201d that lets customers rent business applications instead\nof installing them on their own servers. That means companies\nthat want to arm employees with new software don\u2019t have to worry\nabout buying the underlying hardware, databases and application-\nconnecting middleware. Nor do they have to hire a phalanx of\nconsultants to make programs work together.  Chief Executive Officer  Marc Benioff , speaking at today\u2019s\nCloudforce  conference , said the San Francisco-based company\nwould release additional HR products next year.  \u201cIt\u2019s a big investment area for us,\u201d he said.
