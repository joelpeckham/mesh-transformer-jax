 "context": "The following article called 'Fink Finds Assets Not Enough in BlackRock Bid for Clout' was published on 2012-04-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLaurence D. Fink, who built\n BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  into the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, now is\nseeking to increase the firm\u2019s clout beyond Wall Street to the\nwider public.  Fink is pushing for reputational heft with investors,\nregulators and peers, as the adulation received by rival Pacific\nInvestment Management Co. has eluded the firm he co-founded in\n1988. He\u2019s started a campaign to make BlackRock\u2019s brand better\nknown, and is asserting its views on pivotal issues including\nmoney-fund rules and the dangers of complex exchange-traded\nfunds that are at odds with firms such as Fidelity Investments\nand  Societe Generale SA. (GLE)  He\u2019s seeking to become a champion of\ncorporate governance, urging 600 companies where BlackRock has\nits biggest stakes in to adopt shareholder-friendly practices.  \u201cPeople always asked me what do I care about the most for\nour company, and that\u2019s an easy answer; it\u2019s respect,\u201d Fink,\n59, said in an interview in his office at BlackRock\u2019s  New York \nheadquarters. \u201cBeing the largest asset-management company in\nthe world isn\u2019t a stat that I actually care about. If we\u2019re the\nmost respected asset-management company in the world, that\u2019s a\npretty lofty position.\u201d  Gravitas is crucial for BlackRock as it tries to bolster\nits reputation as an active money manager, woo individual\ninvestors and increase its share of the U.S. mutual-fund\nbusiness, where it holds 2.2 percent of assets. While Fink built\nBlackRock into the world\u2019s largest provider of exchange-traded\nfunds, only about 6 percent of its assets are in actively\nmanaged U.S. retail funds. Fink has said building that business\nis a \u201cbig priority\u201d for BlackRock.  BlackRock\u2019s Diversity  BlackRock\u2019s $3.51 trillion in assets include stocks and\nbonds, institutional accounts,  hedge funds , passive strategies\nand portfolios that use mathematical models, giving it the\nbroadest array of products among money managers. BlackRock has\nalso been picked by government agencies in  Europe  including\nGreece, Germany, Switzerland and Sweden since 2008 to evaluate\nhard-to-value debt portfolios. The firm\u2019s BlackRock Solutions\nunit was selected by the U.S. in 2008 to oversee tainted\nportfolios at the peak of the financial crisis.  \u201cThe core motive driving our brand campaign, our\nregulatory advocacy and our corporate governance engagement is\nour responsibility to our clients,\u201d said Linda Robinson, a\nsenior managing director and global head of marketing and\ncommunications for BlackRock. \u201cThat is the motivation and what\nis driving those actions.\u201d  Pimco\u2019s Followers  Although Newport Beach, California-based Pimco has less\nthan half of BlackRock\u2019s assets, its founder and co-chief\ninvestment officer,  Bill Gross , is one of the most widely\nfollowed bond investment managers and analysts of Federal\nReserve policy. Gross, who was named the fixed-income manager of\nthe decade by  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in 2010, posts monthly investment\noutlooks online and his postings are followed by more than\n62,000 users of the microblogging site Twitter.com.  Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco\u2019s chief executive officer, wrote a\nbook \u201cWhen Markets Collide\u201d in 2008 that was a New York Times\nbestseller, and regularly writes commentaries for newspapers and\nwebsites on topics ranging from the global economy to education.  Pimco, whose $252 billion Total Return Fund is the world\u2019s\nlargest mutual fund, controls 5.5 percent of the mutual-fund\nmarket, according to Strategic Insight, a research firm. Across\nthe company, Pimco attracted $60 billion of client deposits in\n2011 while BlackRock had net withdrawals of $13.7 billion.  \u2018Higher Profile\u2019  Pimco\u2019s parent,  Allianz SE (ALV) , ranks No. 2 globally, with $2.2\ntrillion, including $1.36 trillion at the unit run by El-Erian\nand Gross.  BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors in December\n2009 to add iShares exchange-traded funds to the actively run\nstock and bond funds it oversees, more than doubling its assets.\nMore than half of the firm\u2019s assets were in iShares and other\npassive funds as of the end of last year.  Fink is \u201ctrying to create a higher profile for himself as\nan evenhanded spokesman on corporate governance in general and\non the financial industry in particular, and he does that on the\nsheer size of BlackRock,\u201d said Burton Greenwald, a mutual-fund\nconsultant in Philadelphia.  Gross\u2019s Misstep  Gross\u2019s visibility does have its downside. He missed a\nrally in U.S. Treasuries last year, which resulted in his Total\nReturn Fund lagging behind 69 percent of peers and prompting the\nfund\u2019s first year of client withdrawals even as clients put\nmoney into other Pimco products. Gross wrote a letter to clients\nentitled \u201cMea Culpa,\u201d in which he called 2011 a \u201cstinker.\u201d  Performance at U.S. mutual funds managed by BlackRock may\nstand in the way of the firm\u2019s ambitions. In the three years\nended Feb. 29, BlackRock\u2019s actively managed funds on an asset-\nweighted basis trailed 60 percent of their peers, according to\ndata compiled by Morningstar. During the same period, Pimco beat\n59 percent of its peers, Morningstar data show.  Over the past five years, BlackRock did better compared\nwith many peers, beating 63 percent. Pimco\u2019s over that period\noutperformed 91 percent of peers, data from Morningstar show.  BlackRock said the comparison doesn\u2019t reflect the more\ndiverse and global nature of its business, and doesn\u2019t factor in\nits institutional and non-U.S. mutual funds. Across all of its\nactively managed strategies globally, 74 percent of assets\noutperformed benchmarks or peers over five years, according to\nthe company.  Performance Not \u2018Terrific\u2019  BlackRock has had \u201ca lot of changes at the top, but what\nyou haven\u2019t seen is this being synthesized into terrific\nperformance,\u201d said  Eric Jacobson , a senior analyst at Chicago-\nbased Morningstar, referring to BlackRock.  The firm\u2019s first priority is delivering top performance for\nactive funds, Fink said. At an event hosted by the UCLA Anderson\nSchool of Management and Bloomberg Television in November, Fink\nsaid he admires Pimco\u2019s consistent long-term track record and\ninfluence. Gross\u2019s Pimco Total Return returned an annual average\nof 8.3 percent in the five years through March 30, beating 98\npercent of similarly managed funds, according to data compiled\nby Bloomberg. During the past 10 years, the fund gained 7\npercent.  \u201cI could give you pockets where we did really well\nconsistently and areas not so well. However, the number one\nthing we have to be great at is performance in our alpha\nproducts,\u201d Fink, who has been chairman and CEO of the firm\nsince co-founding it, said in the interview last month. Alpha\nproducts seek to beat the returns of market benchmarks.  BlackRock\u2019s Reputation  BlackRock has work to do to improve its reputation among\nsome institutional investors as well. It was rated No. 4 by\npensions and No. 9 by nonprofits, compared with Pimco\u2019s No. 1\nranking for both, in terms of favorable impressions among\nprospective clients, according to a study released last month by\nCogent Research that surveyed 650 pension and nonprofit\ninvestors with at least $20 million in assets.  The company, started in a one-room office in Manhattan with\n$1 billion in assets, achieved its ascent from a bond shop to a\ndiversified firm managing stocks, bonds, hedge funds, index\nfunds and ETFs by acquiring competitors. In 2004, it purchased\nState Street Research & Management for $375 million from  MetLife\nInc. (MET)  and two years later it acquired Merrill Lynch\u2019s investment\nunit for $9 billion, bringing its assets above the $1 trillion\nmark. BlackRock bought the hedge fund-of-funds business of\nQuellos Group LLC in 2008.  BlackRock\u2019s first move into the spotlight came when it went\npublic in 1999, raising $126 million in an initial offering.  \u2018Being Visible\u2019  \u201cI don\u2019t like being that visible in the industry -- I much\npreferred the first 12 years when no one knew who BlackRock\nwas,\u201d Fink said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I could stand there and\nsay our voice could be silent anymore. Our scale, our\nvisibility, our business model has given us a platform in which\nwe need to have a voice on behalf of our clients.\u201d  BlackRock\u2019s shares have gained 40 percent since it\nannounced that it would acquire Merrill Lynch\u2019s investment unit\nin February 2006, compared with the 18 percent decline in the\n20-member index that tracks asset managers and custody banks.  To make its views heard, BlackRock in February began its\n\u201cnew world\u201d campaign, telling clients how to invest in an\nuncertain market, three years after Pimco coined the term \u201cnew\nnormal\u201d following the 2008 financial crisis. Fink last year\nsaid he didn\u2019t share Pimco\u2019s view on the post-crisis economy and\ntheory of \u201cnew normal,\u201d which describes a world of subdued\nstock and bond returns as growth slows in developed economies\nand  emerging markets  grow more dominant.  Ad Campaign  Four-page inserts appeared in publications including the\n Wall Street  Journal and the Financial Times as part of\nBlackRock\u2019s campaign. In a speech to the Council on Foreign\nRelations in February, Fink said the traditional mix of putting\n60 percent of assets in stocks and 40 percent in bonds is\ninadequate in a market characterized by an aging population, a\nreduction in borrowing and risk-taking by individuals and\ngovernments, and a greater role of emerging economies.  BlackRock executives including  Robert Kapito  and  Robert Doll  have also been speaking publicly about how investors can be\nharmed by sitting in cash and focusing on short-term investing.  Kapito, a co-founder and president of the firm, told CNN\nMoney last month that he has about 70 percent of his investment\nportfolio in dividend-paying global stocks. Both he and Doll,\nBlackRock\u2019s chief equity strategist, have appeared on CNBC\npromoting equities this year. About 44 percent of BlackRock\u2019s\nassets are in equities, which generated almost half of the\nfirm\u2019s revenue in 2011, or $4.4 billion, according to company\nfilings.  Household Name  Becoming a household name is important because then it\u2019s\neasier for brokers to sell BlackRock\u2019s products to retail\ninvestors, said Luke Montgomery, a research analyst who covers\nasset managers at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York.  It\u2019s prudent for asset managers to try to get retail\ndollars because more money is shifting to individuals with the\nmove to defined contribution plans, where savers handle their\nown money, from defined benefit plans, said  Jeffrey Hopson , a\nresearch analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. in St. Louis. There\nwas $4.5 trillion in defined contribution plans as of Dec. 31,\naccording to the  Investment Company Institute .  \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a campaign this retail-oriented and are\nnow investing more in that brand,\u201d said Fink.  BlackRock has also become more vocal about regulatory\npolicies and taken positions that contrast with the views of\npeers in the industry in its quest to establish itself as a\nleader. The firm released a report last month outlining how\nregulators could make a floating net-asset value, or NAV,\nacceptable to money-market investors and managers.  \u2018Leadership Position\u2019  BlackRock, which had previously opposed floating the NAV,\nsaid doing so wouldn\u2019t cripple the product, putting it at odds\nwith firms including Pittsburgh-based  Federated Investors Inc. (FII) \nand Boston-based Fidelity.  \u201cSome of this is getting in front of issues that have been\nlong-term issues that no one has spent the time addressing,\u201d\nKapito said in an interview on March 13. \u201cSo why don\u2019t we take\na leadership position, go out and identify some of these issues,\ntry to come up with solutions to these issues and get the\nindustry to move in that direction?\u201d  BlackRock oversaw $145 billion in U.S. money-market mutual\nfunds as of Feb. 29, making it the seventh-largest manager,\naccording to data compiled by research firm Crane Data LLC of\nWestborough, Massachusetts. Last year, money-market funds\naccounted for about 4 percent of revenue, filings show.  Synthetic ETFs  \u201cI think of this as very welcome and appropriate from a\nfirm like BlackRock,\u201d Paul Schott Stevens, president of the\nInvestment Company Institute, the Washington-based trade group\nthat has opposed any additional changes to money-market funds,\nsaid in an interview. \u201cI view it as a leadership exercise.\u201d  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest ETF provider, in October\ncalled for better transparency and disclosure of ETFs that use\nderivatives. Almost all of BlackRock\u2019s ETFs are backed by\nstocks, bonds or commodities they seek to track.  So-called synthetic ETFs, offered in Europe by firms\nincluding Societe Generale\u2019s Lyxor Asset Management, introduce a\nlayer of complexity and counterparty risk that investors may not\nbe aware of, Fink said at a conference in November.  All Lyxor ETFs are fully regulated with levels of\ntransparency and risk management that typically exceed\nregulatory requirements, Simon Klein, head of European ETFs at\nLyxor, said in an e-mailed statement. Lyxor has said that\nBlackRock\u2019s warnings distract from the risk associated with\nsecurities lending by physical ETFs, which is that a borrower\nwill collapse and fail to return them.  \u2018Married With Performance\u2019  BlackRock is also advocating for better corporate\ngovernance at companies it invests in. In January, the firm sent\nletters to 600 companies in which it holds at least 5 percent of\nthe shares to adopt more shareholder-friendly practices. And\nBlackRock recently filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission to open a fund that excludes companies that have ties\nto countries where there are human rights violations.  The firm\u2019s efforts won\u2019t translate into results overnight,\nsaid  Geoff Bobroff , a mutual-fund consultant in  East Greenwich ,\n Rhode Island .  \u201cBuilding awareness and creating a brand is years in the\nmaking, not weeks or days or months,\u201d Bobroff said. \u201cIt\nultimately has to be married with performance.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAlexis Leondis in New York at \n aleondis@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChristian Baumgaertel at \n cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Morningstar, Inc. was 57.64716720581055 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Morningstar, Inc. was ",
