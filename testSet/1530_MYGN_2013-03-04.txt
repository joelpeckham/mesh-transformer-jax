 "context": "The following article called 'Myriad Genetics Win on Gene Patent Ownership Is Appealed' was published on 2013-03-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMyriad Genetics Inc. (MYGN) \u2019s Australian\ncourt victory recognizing its ownership of patents for genes\nlinked to cancer risks will be appealed by a group representing\ncancer patients, a  law firm  said.  Cancer Voices Australia and Yvonne D\u2019Arcy, a Brisbane\nresident diagnosed with  breast cancer , sued in 2010 to stop\nMyriad and  Genetic Technologies Ltd. (GTG)  from patenting an isolated\nDNA associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian\ncancers, according to  Maurice Blackburn  Lawyers. The firm said\nit has filed the appeal in the Federal Court of Australia today.  \u201cWe intend to continue the challenge to the monopoly\ncreated by the patent held by Myriad,\u201d Rebecca Gilsenan, a\nlawyer at Melbourne-based Maurice Blackburn, said in an e-mailed\nstatement.  The issue has divided the global medical community, with\ngroups including the  Association for Molecular Pathology  and the\nAmerican College of Medical Genetics arguing that Myriad is\ntrying to get legal ownership of parts of the human body. The\n U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit, which specializes\nin patent law, has twice ruled that genes can be patented.  The Myriad case returns to the U.S. Supreme Court this year\nafter the U.S. high court  agreed  Nov. 30 to hear the Association\nfor Molecular Pathology\u2019s appeal.  Australian Federal Court Justice John Nicholas ruled Feb.\n15 that the method used by Myriad and Genetic Technologies of\npurging a gene of biological material is a manufacturing process\nthat can be patented.  Some scientists argue they have been stymied in researching\nnew medicines and treatments because they may come up against\ndemands for royalties or letters demanding they stop using\npatented inventions. Companies such as  Genomic Health Inc. (GHDX)  have\nargued they can\u2019t attract investment dollars if they can\u2019t\nprotect their research from competitors.  \u201cI won\u2019t give up the fight,\u201d D\u2019Arcy said in today\u2019s\nstatement. \u201cWe need to continue for future generations of\npeople who at some point in their life, may need treatment for\ncancer and other diseases.\u201d  The case is: Cancer Voices Australia v.
