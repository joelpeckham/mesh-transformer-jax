 "context": "The following article called 'Iris Scans Seen Shrinking $7 Billion Medical Data Breach' was published on 2013-04-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIris scanners aren\u2019t just for\nairport border-control agents and spy movies anymore.  Clinics and hospitals around the world are acquiring\ntechnology that identifies people based on physical traits to\nimprove  patient safety  and stamp out fraud.  HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) \nhospitals in London, as well as health-care providers across the\nU.S., are buying so-called biometric technologies.  Biometrics makers, such as  Safran SA (SAF) ,  Fujitsu Ltd. (6702)  and\nclosely held  AOptix Technologies Inc.  and  M2Sys Technology , say\ndemand from health-care providers is growing. While ensuring the\nright person gets the right treatment is the main reason for\nbuying biometrics, hospitals and patients see another benefit:\nreducing the risk of data breaches that can lead to identity\ntheft.  \u201cIt\u2019s a form of health-care fraud,\u201d said Pam Dixon,\nexecutive director of the  World Privacy Forum , a San Diego-based\nnonprofit research organization. \u201cYou can make a lot of money\nvery quickly as a criminal with a low probability of getting\ncaught. It\u2019s a far easier crime to commit than robbing a bank.\u201d  Identify theft is leaving hospitals with unpaid bills and\nconsumers on the hook for costly treatment they didn\u2019t receive.\nData breaches, which include lost and stolen information, may\ncost the health-care industry in the U.S. as much as $7 billion\na year, according to a survey conducted by the  Ponemon\nInstitute , a Traverse City, Michigan-based organization that\nstudies privacy, data protection and security.  ID Cards  That explains why the health-care industry represents a\ngrowth area for the biometrics market, which Louisville,\nColorado-based Acuity Market Intelligence  forecast  will increase\nabout 20 percent a year to almost $11 billion by 2017.  The shares of Paris-based Safran, whose Morpho unit is the\nworld\u2019s biggest biometrics company, have gained 35 percent in\nthe past year, while Tokyo-based Fujitsu has risen 2.5 percent.  HCA, the largest for-profit U.S. hospital chain, is using\niris scanners at its private facilities in  London  after\nconsidering patient ID cards with magnetic strips.  \u201cWe needed something that people can\u2019t not bring with\nthem,\u201d said Mike Gogola, chief information officer for HCA\nInternational, the Nashville, Tennessee-based company\u2019s overseas\narm. Fingerprinting wasn\u2019t popular because of its association\nwith identifying criminals, so the company chose iris technology\nfrom closely held  Eye Controls LLC  of Rockville,  Maryland .  Missed Diagnoses  Electronic medical records and computerized drug-ordering\nsystems have made it easier for caregivers to exchange\ninformation needed to treat patients. Such systems can still be\nprone to errors: A patient\u2019s allergies or test results may end\nup in the wrong place if another patient has a similar name, or\nduplicate medical records exist for the same person. That can\nlead to repeated orders for lab work, missed diagnoses, adverse\ndrug reactions and even death.  More than half of the 80 health-care organizations that\nparticipated in the Ponemon Institute\u2019s survey reported one or\nmore incidents of medical  identity theft . Ninety-four percent\nhad at least one data breach in the past two years, and 45\npercent reported that they had more than five such breaches. The\nsurvey was sponsored by ID Experts Corp., a  Portland , Oregon-\nbased company that sells products and services to prevent data\nbreaches.  \u201cThis is a technology whose time has arrived both in a\ncost sense and in terms of its potential utilization,\u201d said Ted\nDunstone, chief executive officer of Sydney-based biometrics\nconsulting firm  Biometix . \u201cIt has the potential to radically\nalter the way hospitals deliver their service. I think we will\nsee a lot more adoption both of iris technology and of\nbiometrics generally in the health-care sector.\u201d  Not Foolproof  The technology isn\u2019t foolproof. Medical identity theft is\noften an inside job, with employees of health-care providers\nstealing and selling the information, the World Privacy Forum\u2019s\nDixon said. Electronic record-keeping has made it easier to\nsteal many identities at once, and using biometrics may only\ncreate more information to steal, she said.  \u201cYou can scam this just as you scam an ID card,\u201d Dixon\nsaid. \u201cPalm vein scans or iris scans can be associated with\nother records, but you have to be inside the system to do it.\u201d  In 2007, a woman who worked at the  Cleveland Clinic  in\n Florida   pleaded guilty  to improperly obtaining information about\nmore than 1,000 patients and selling it to her cousin. The data\nwas used to submit $7 million in bills to the Medicare program.  Shame-Based Theft  Medical identity theft also occurs in the U.K., where all\nresidents have access to the taxpayer-funded  National Health\nService . Some people steal patient data to bill for private\nhealth-care services, a market valued at about 9 billion pounds\n($13.9 billion) in 2009, according to a 2011  study  by the  Office\nof Fair Trading . There is also \u201cshame-based\u201d theft, in which a\npatient who doesn\u2019t want his illness to be known seeks care\nusing someone else\u2019s identity, Dixon said.  Such incidents are spurring hospitals to look into\nbiometric technologies, said Mizan Rahman, chief executive\nofficer of Atlanta-based M2Sys.  Using biometric technologies such as iris scans, facial\nrecognition and fingerprint and  palm vein scans  provides a level\nof assurance about a person\u2019s identity that can\u2019t be provided by\na password or key card, which can be given to someone else,\nDunstone said in an interview. Biometrics are also convenient,\nsince a person always has their identifying features with them,\nhe said.  More Affordable  Technologies that don\u2019t require the user to touch a device,\nsuch as iris scanners, are particularly important in hospitals,\nwhere physical contact can spread diseases, Dunstone said. The\ntechnology is also becoming more affordable, with an iris\nscanning unit costing about $200 to $300, he said. Prices may\ndecline further, he said.  Among biometrics, the iris is considered the most unique\nidentifier, according to AOptix, a closely held company in\nCampbell,  California , whose technology is used at Gatwick\nAirport in London.  The iris has so many features that it\u2019s 100,000 times more\nresistant to false identification than face recognition, said\nJoey Pritikin, AOptix\u2019s director of product marketing for\nIdentity Solutions. Not even identical twins have the same iris,\nand a person\u2019s right and left eyes have different irises.  \u201cWe are simply starting to understand the health-care\nmarket,\u201d Pritikin said in an interview. \u201cThis is a new\napplication.\u201d  Light-Emitting Diode  Scanners are used when patients check in as well as in\nradiology and at the cashier, HCA\u2019s Gogola said. When a patient\nis first enrolled, a camera will take a digital picture of the\niris using low-power light-emitting diodes, known as LED\nlighting, from as close as 1 inch or 2 inches to as far as a few\nyards away.  Most patients approve, though using the system isn\u2019t\nmandatory, Gogola said.  \u201cPatients equate high-tech with high quality,\u201d Gogola\nsaid. \u201cThis streamlines the patient journey.\u201d  Eye Controls technology has been used at  Urban Health Plan\nInc. , which operates medical centers in  New York  City. M2Sys\nsaid it\u2019s signed up dozens of hospitals, including Hugh Chatham\nMemorial Hospital in Elkin,  North Carolina , and Phoebe Dorminy\nMedical Center in Fitzgerald,  Georgia .  \u201cWe tried to penetrate the health-care market almost six\nyears ago,\u201d Rahman said. \u201cAt the time, we had only a\nfingerprint system. We saw tons of resistance because no one\nwanted to touch the scanner.\u201d  About a year ago, iris scanning became more affordable and\nmore common, and M2Sys changed its approach. The company\u2019s\nproduct is an extension of the hospital\u2019s electronic medical\nrecords system, and involves a \u201cpainless training process,\u201d\nRahman said.  Low-tech approaches to security, such as asking patients\nfor photo ID and training employees on how to handle sensitive\ninformation, remain important ways to stop identity theft as\nwell, both Ponemon and Dixon said.  \u201cThere is no magic, silver bullet that will prevent\nthis,\u201d Dixon said.
