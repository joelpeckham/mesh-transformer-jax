The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBillionaire Paul Allen wants Seattle\nto grow up -- again.  City planners are preparing a recommendation on raising\nheight limits for new buildings in South Lake Union, the former\nwarehouse district north of downtown where  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  moved\nits headquarters. Vulcan Inc., Allen\u2019s Seattle-based investment\ncompany, is the main proponent of taller buildings in the area.  It would be the third time since 2005 that  Seattle  has\nraised the maximum height of buildings in and near downtown. The\npotential change, to be presented by June to the mayor, was\nspurred in part by a  forecast  that Seattle will gain as many as\n100,000 residents and 84,000 jobs by 2024. Mayor Mike McGinn\nwill make a recommendation to the city council, which is likely\nto reach a decision by the end of the year.  Vulcan\u2019s  real estate unit  owns about one-sixth of the land\nin South Lake Union, where it has added or is building 5 million\nsquare feet (465,000 square meters) of offices, stores,\nrestaurants, apartments and medical-research labs.  \u201cThere are many community benefits to building up,\u201d said\nAda M. Healey, vice president of real estate for Vulcan, in an\ninterview. \u201cIt\u2019s a more efficient use of limited resources, and\nbetter environmentally. The best solution for the city is a\nsmart approach to density that incorporates taller buildings\nwhere it makes sense.\u201d  \u2018Hottest Neighborhood\u2019  Vulcan wants new apartment towers near the lake shore. More\nstories will mean more residents, creating a  livelier\nneighborhood , generating  tax revenue  and allowing people who\nwork downtown to walk to their jobs or use public\ntransportation, which would reduce pollution, Healey said.  \u201cSouth Lake Union is the hottest neighborhood for retail\nin Seattle,\u201d said Jeremy Moller, a broker at JSH Properties\nInc. \u201cTraditional retail strongholds command higher rents and\nhave higher sales volumes, but no neighborhood has more buzz or\ninterest from retailers at this time.\u201d  A group called the  Lake Union Opportunity Alliance \nadvocates a step-down to the waterfront, with the tallest\nproperties farthest from the lake, home to Seattle\u2019s annual\nFourth of July fireworks display. The alliance doesn\u2019t oppose\ntaller buildings, as long as they aren\u2019t built adjacent to the\nwater, said Chris Gemmill, a spokesman for the group, made up\nmainly of residents and small-business owners in the area.  No \u2018Money Block\u2019  \u201cWe don\u2019t want a \u2018money block\u2019 of 300-foot towers at the\nlake, which could cause the rest of the area to stagnate\neconomically,\u201d Gemmill said in an interview. Construction ought\nto mimic the natural bowl-like topography of the area, which is\nsurrounded by Queen Anne Hill to the west,  Capitol Hill  to the\nEast and office towers in the central business district to the\nsouth, he said.  Current zoning can accommodate the projected population and\njob growth in South Lake Union through 2024, Gemmill said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to build more than we need and incentivize\na boom-and-bust cycle or impede development opportunities in the\ndowntown core,\u201d Gemmill said.  Under current zoning, 16,000 jobs and 8,000 households are\nexpected to be added to South Lake Union between 2004 and 2024.\nAmazon.com alone has relocated \u201cthousands\u201d of employees to the\ndistrict since moving its headquarters in 2010, said Mary Osako,\na company spokeswoman. She declined to give the exact number of\nworkers who moved.  Amazon.com\u2019s South Lake Union campus has room for about\n8,500 employees based on its space built or under construction\nand the industry average of 200 square feet per employee. The\ncompany also leases space nearby with room for an additional\n4,600 employees, based on the same formula.  Three Height Options  Seattle\u2019s  Department of Planning and Development  is\nconsidering three  alternatives  for increasing height limits, as\nwell as the option of maintaining current zoning, said James\nHolmes, a senior urban planner at the department. The first\nalternative calls for the highest limits, of as much as 240 feet\n(73 meters) for commercial buildings and 400 feet for\nresidential, with the other two plans calling for smaller\nchanges.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for a few years at appropriate\nheights,\u201d Holmes said. There would need to be a benefit to the\npublic in exchange for taller buildings, he said. \u201cAffordable\nhousing is heavily weighted because it\u2019s an urban center.\u201d  Most of the  neighborhood  is currently zoned for maximum\nheights of 65 feet to 85 feet, or about six to seven stories,\ndepending on the block, Holmes said. Near the lake front, on\nValley and Mercer streets, the maximum height is 40 feet.\nHeights of 65 feet are allowed as long as 25 percent of the\ndevelopment area is devoted to publicly accessible open space,\nhe said.  BioMed Center Approval  Rezoning already has been accomplished in parts of South\nLake Union as individual projects have sought and won approval\nfor lifting height restrictions.  BioMed Realty Trust Inc. (BMR) , a San\nDiego-based owner of biotechnology and pharmaceutical offices\nand labs, won city council approval in December to build a\nresearch center to 85 feet.  \u201cThere have been enough contract rezones within South Lake\nUnion that are consistent with the proposed rezoning that it\nseems apparent the rezoning will go forward,\u201d said Lisa Picard,\nexecutive vice president and regional head in Seattle for\nSkanska USA, the New York-based unit of Swedish construction\ncompany  Skanska AB. (SKAB)   The company in January bought 43,000 square feet at 400\nFairview Avenue North and is seeking a zoning change to build an\noffice-and-retail complex at the site, Picard said.  \u2018Urban Centers\u2019  \u201cYou need a certain amount of density to support a really\nactive ground floor,\u201d Picard said.  The Planning Department expects to release a final\nenvironmental impact statement on the proposed changes within\ntwo months, and a final city council decision is likely by the\nend of 2012, Holmes said.  South Lake Union is one of six areas Seattle designated as\n\u201curban centers\u201d in the city\u2019s 2004 growth plan. Seattle\nofficials want to foster a concentration of jobs and housing in\nthose areas to preserve single-family neighborhoods and protect\nnatural resources. Other urban centers include the Northgate\narea, home to a  Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG)  shopping mall.  South Lake Union is a mostly square-shaped neighborhood\nbordered by the lake at the north, Denny Way to the south,\nAurora Avenue at the west and Interstate 5 to the east. The\ndistrict includes two stretches extending north along the lake\u2019s\nwestern and eastern shores.  Allen\u2019s Fortune  Vulcan has already built or is constructing about half its\ndevelopment potential in South Lake Union. The company owns\nabout 57 acres (23 hectares) in South Lake Union, said Lori\nMason Curran, director of real estate investment strategy at\nVulcan. The district has a total of about 330 acres, according\nto the city.  Allen, Vulcan\u2019s founder, also is the co-founder of\n Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the main source of his fortune. The 59-year-old\nphilanthropist and owner of the Seattle Seahawks football team\nhad a net worth of $13.2 billion in 2011, making him the 23rd-\nrichest American, according to Forbes magazine. He began\nacquiring land in South Lake Union in 1996 with the goal of\ncreating a waterfront park to be called Seattle Commons, an idea\nthat voters rejected.
