 "context": "The following article called 'Ending Blind Loans to Aid Crackdown on 323% Rates: Brazil Credit' was published on 2012-10-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff\ntook the final step to enact legislation that may help achieve\nher goal of reducing the highest credit-card rates in the\nAmericas, 16 months after the measure was approved by Congress.  The government published implementation rules today\nfor a law that paves the way for Brazil to establish consumer\ncredit scores for the first time. The changes open the way for\nlocal affiliates of  Experian Plc (EXPN)  and  Equifax Inc. (EFX) , the world\u2019s\nbiggest credit bureaus, to compile payment histories that\nprevious legislation barred them from accessing.  Brazil\u2019s 323 percent average annual credit-card rates\ncompare with 17 percent in the U.S. and 34 percent in  Mexico ,\naccording to a  study  by consumer-defense association Proteste\npublished in July. The legal changes correspond with Rousseff\u2019s\neffort to get banks to cut lending rates after policy makers\nlowered the benchmark to a record 7.25 percent last week to help\nrevive growth forecast to be the slowest since 2009.  \u201cThe big benefit is you can charge better customers less,\nand worse customers more,\u201d said Erico Ferreira, the Sao Paulo-\nbased head of Acrefi, Brazil\u2019s association of credit, financing\nand investment institutions. \u201cYou can offer better pricing.\u201d  The law repeals rules that allow card issuers to only\ngather data on defaults and delinquencies.  Credit Scoring  Credit scoring will help bolster Brazil\u2019s credit card\nexpansion in years to come after lending grew 17 percent in the\n12 months through August, compared with 19 percent the year\nbefore, said Jose Renato Simao Borges, the former head of credit\ncards at Osasco, Brazil-based  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  who is now\npresident of credit-card issuer Credz.  \u201cIn every country where credit scoring was allowed, credit\ngrew 50 percent afterwards,\u201d Borges said in an interview.  Rousseff\u2019s predecessor, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, vetoed\nsimilar legislation in 2010, citing concerns by consumer groups\nover privacy rights. Final approval by Rousseff was held up as\nthe government and credit bureaus debated privacy and liability\nissues tied to collecting the data, according to Boa Vista\nServicos, a credit data company 15 percent owned by Equifax.  The new rules allow bureaus to track debt-to-income ratios\nand payment punctuality and require that consumers provide\nconsent before their histories can be recorded.  Expanded Access  While Rousseff said in a nationally televised address on\nSept. 6 that she wasn\u2019t satisfied with banks\u2019 efforts to cut\nborrowing costs, banks say the rates they charge reflect the\nrisk they take on. Default rates rose to 28 percent in August on\ncredit-card accounts at least 90 days overdue, almost four times\nthe  7.9 percent on consumer loans , according to data from the\ncentral bank.  The new rules will expand access to credit for Brazilians\nwhose per capita income is 291 reais to 1,019 reais ($143 to\n$502) a month, the classification for the nation\u2019s emerging\nmiddle class, Dorival Dourado, the president of Boa Vista, said\nin an interview in his Sao Paulo office. Only 18 percent use\ncredit cards as their main form of payment, compared with 44\npercent of those who earn at least 2,480 reais, according to Boa\nVista.  \u201cThe bureaus will allow companies to know more about these\npeople and create better conditions for lower rates,\u201d Dourado\nsaid.  Financial Data  The new rules will quadruple the amount of information\nregulators have about the financial system, reaching 96 percent\nof all individual loans, central bank President Alexandre Tombini said in March at an event in Sao Paulo to present the\nrevamped system. They will also help the central bank design\nmeasures to ensure the financial system functions soundly, he\nsaid.  Average credit-card rates in  Brazil  could be as much as 35\npercent lower should banks be able to get an accurate profile of\nwhom they\u2019re lending to, Dourado said. The old system caused all\ncustomers who don\u2019t have a record of default to be treated as\nequally risky, he said.  While credit can improve the quality of life for Brazilians\nemerging from poverty, many consumers aren\u2019t prepared for the\nresponsibilities and risks of taking on debt, said  Larissa\nDavidovich , who heads the unit for protection of highly indebted\nconsumers at the public defender\u2019s office in Rio de Janeiro.  A  67 percent surge  in lending in Brazil in the last three\nyears as more people became eligible for credit helped push the\ndefault rate on credit cards to a three-year high in August,\nsapping consumer demand and threatening to saddle banks with\nlosses.  Credit Education  \u201cThe problem is the accumulation of debt by people who\ndon\u2019t have the education or preparation and aren\u2019t aware of what\nthey\u2019re getting into,\u201d Davidovich said at an event in Sao Paulo\nheld by the association of credit-card businesses. \u201cWe are\nreceiving more and more requests from people in drastic\nsituations, like a woman who amassed 14 credit cards.\u201d  The extra yield investors demand to own Brazilian\ngovernment dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell one\nbasis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 134 basis points at\n10:11 a.m. in Sao Paulo, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The cost of protecting Brazilian bonds against default for\nfive years rose one basis point to 110 basis points, according\nto prices compiled by Bloomberg. Credit-default swaps pay the\nbuyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or\nthe cash equivalent if a borrower fails to adhere to its debt\nagreements.  Default Rates  The real strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.0292 per dollar.\nYields on interest-rate futures contracts due in January 2014\nfell two basis points to 7.41 percent.  Personal loan default rates have peaked and will drop amid\nslowing credit growth as banks stop extending loans to the\nriskiest borrowers, said Ricardo Loureira, the president of\nSerasa Experian, Brazil\u2019s largest credit data provider, which is\ncontrolled by Dublin-based Experian said in a telephone\ninterview.  Positive credit histories will lead to more credit for\nthose with a record of paying on time and will increase the\nvolume of transactions, he said in a phone interview from Sao\nPaulo.  \u201cThe previous model has been exhausted for the dimensions\nof credit in Brazil,\u201d Loureira said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer possible\nto continue  managing risk  with the previous model.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nBlake Schmidt in Sao Paulo at \n bschmidt16@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nDavid Papadopoulos at \n papadopoulos@bloomberg.net ;\nMichael Tsang at \n mtsang1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 33.6654052734375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
