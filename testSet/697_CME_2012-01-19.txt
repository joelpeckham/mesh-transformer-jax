 "context": "The following article called 'KKR\u2019s TXU Buyout Faces 91% Default Odds in Shale Boom: Corporate Finance' was published on 2012-01-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  bond market  has never been more\npessimistic on the chances of KKR & Co. and TPG Capital being\nable to salvage the biggest leveraged  buyout  in history -- the\n$43.2 billion purchase in 2007 of the electricity provider known\nthen as TXU Corp.  Since the private equity firms bought the Dallas-based\ncompany, now known as  Energy Future Holdings Corp. (TXU) , with $45\nbillion in debt financing, natural gas prices have tumbled 50\npercent as a process for extracting the fuel from shale called\nfracking rises in popularity. That has cut electricity prices in\nhalf as well.  Less than a year after extending the maturities on more\nthan $17.8 billion of debt, credit-default swaps traders are\npricing in a 91 percent chance that the company will fail to\nmeet its obligations in the next three years. Its debt\nsecurities yield about 21 percent on average, up from 15 percent\nwhen the refinancing was announced in April.  \u201cThe clock has gotten much louder for TXU with this recent\nfalloff in natural gas,\u201d said Jon Sablowsky, the head of\ntrading at investment firm Brownstone Investment Group LLC in\n New York . The company is overlevered and doesn\u2019t have \u201cenough\nrevenue to service that debt going forward, nor enough revenue\nto provide the confidence to investors to help them refinance\nthat debt,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.  KKR and TPG are losing a bet they made in 2007 that natural\ngas prices would continue to drive wholesale power prices\nhigher, a wager that soured when a recession sapped demand just\nas drilling expanded in the gas-rich Marcellus shale in the\neastern U.S.  Losing Bet  Wholesale electricity prices plunged as gas prices dropped,\nhammering independent wholesale generators such as Energy Future\nthat don\u2019t have the protections given to regulated utilities\nwhere states allow a certain level of profits.  The concern among credit traders has grown more urgent as\nthe plunge in natural gas prices raises the potential cost of\nrenewing hedges against price swings that expire in 2015.  Three-year credit-default swaps tied to Texas Competitive\nElectric Holdings, the company\u2019s unregulated merchant power unit\nknown as TCEH, have soared 45.7 percentage points during the\npast seven months to 69.5 percent upfront yesterday, according\nto data provider CMA. That\u2019s 4.4 percentage points less than the\ncost for five years of protection, compared with 24 percentage\npoints on June 15.  The price means the initial cost to protect against a\ndefault on $10 million of the company\u2019s debt through March 2015\nhas climbed to $6.95 million from $2.38 million in June.  Recovery Rate  The contracts are trading at levels that imply a 91 percent\nchance of default, based on market assumptions that bondholders\nwould recover 14.5 cents on the dollar in such a scenario,\naccording to CMA, which is owned by  CME Group Inc. (CME)  and compiles\nprices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower\nfails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted\ndebt.  Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for KKR in New York, whose co-\nchairmen are  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , and  Owen Blicksilver , a spokesman for  Fort Worth , Texas-based TPG,\ndeclined to comment.  Energy Future \u201cgenerates stable  cash flow  through solid\noperational performance in a growing market, has adequate\nliquidity and has re-worked its capital structure to reduce debt\nand extend debt maturities,\u201d Allan Koenig, a spokesman for the\ncompany, said in an e-mailed statement. The power producer\nemploys more than 9,000 people, up 25 percent from 2007, he\nsaid.  Gas Supply Grows  Gas supply in the U.S. has grown since producers learned to\nuse hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling to tap deposits\nlocked in dense shale rock formations.  The commodity, which traded as high as $13.58 in July 2008,\nwill stay below 2011\u2019s average price of $4.026 for the next two\nyears, or about $3.10 per million British thermal units for 2012\nand $4 for 2013, according to Robert W.  Baird (BADC)  & Co., an\ninvestment bank in  Milwaukee . Natural gas for February delivery\nfell 12.6 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $2.346 per million British\nthermal units today on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the\nlowest settlement price since March 2002.  That price is \u201cbrutal\u201d for Energy Future because TCEH\nneeds $6.15 to break even, and leaves \u201czero recovery\u201d for\nbondholders beyond the first lien, said  Andy DeVries , an analyst\nat CreditSights Inc. in New York.  Price Hedges  Hedges that contributed to one-time gains of $89 million\nlast quarter by locking in natural gas prices expire by 2015,\naccording to the company\u2019s most recent quarterly filing with the\nU.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission. The hedges lock in\nnatural gas at a weighted average price of about $7.36 for 2012,\ncompared with a weighted average market price of $4.24.  \u201cThey\u2019re so well hedged in the near term, and they\u2019ve got\nsome room under the maintenance covenants so weak gas prices\nshouldn\u2019t be a problem this year,\u201d DeVries said. \u201cIt\u2019s when\nthe hedges start to expire when push comes to shove.\u201d  Energy Future reported a loss of $710 million on Oct. 28\nfor the third quarter, as interest expenses and related costs\nrose by 50 percent and sales fell 11 percent. The company and\nits wholly owned power-delivery unit Oncor Holdings had long-\nterm debt of $40.18 billion. U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency rules intended to reduce cross-state air pollution will\ncost the company $1.5 billion through 2020, the company said in\na lawsuit with the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in September.  Lenders agreed in April to extend debt maturities on about\n$17.8 billion of the  company\u2019s debt  and swapped some holdings at\ndiscounted prices for new securities.  Distressed Exchanges  \u201cWe view Energy Future Holdings Corp.\u2019s multiple\ndistressed exchanges and credit facility extensions as\ntantamount to default,\u201d Standard & Poor\u2019s analysts Aneesh\nPrabhu and Andrew Giudici wrote in a Jan. 11 note.  Texas Competitive\u2019s $1.87 billion of 10.25 percent bonds\ndue November 2015 dropped 7 cents to 28 cents on the dollar this\nyear, yielding 60.564 percent as of Jan. 17, according to Trace,\nthe bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority.  \u201cEven if you\u2019re secured, you have to be scratching your\nhead and wondering where the mechanism for repayment is coming\nfrom,\u201d Bonnie Baha, the head of the global developed credit\ngroup at DoubleLine Capital LP, which oversees $23 billion, said\nin a telephone interview from  Los Angeles . \u201cGiven the\ncompetitive landscape, given the changes that have occurred in\nthe natural gas industry that weren\u2019t really foreseen at the\ntime these deals were structured, I\u2019d say your capital is better\ndeployed elsewhere.\u201d  Prospects \u2018Negative\u2019  Energy Future\u2019s term loan maturing in October 2017 traded\nat about 61.3 cents on the dollar yesterday, from 63.6 cents on\nJan. 9, according to Markit Group Ltd. The term debt due in\nOctober 2014 was trading at 64.7 cents from 69 cents.  Energy Future unit Oncor Electric Delivery has $375.6\nmillion of 6.375 percent notes maturing in May and $524.7\nmillion due September 2013, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. About $3.8 billion of TCEH loans mature in October\n2014, Bloomberg data show.  \u201cThere are no near-term maturities and there\u2019s no\nmaintenance covenant that can be tripped in the near term, but\nthere\u2019s a view that they\u2019re not going to be able to refinance\ntheir debt at TCEH,\u201d Chris Chaice, an analyst at New York-based\nCovenant Review, said in a telephone interview. \u201cLong-term\nprospects are very negative for TCEH. The time at which they can\nno longer support the  capital structure  is growing nearer.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMary Childs in New York at \n mchilds5@bloomberg.net ;\nJulie Johnsson in Chicago at \n jjohnsson@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAlan Goldstein at \n agoldstein5@bloomberg.net ;\nSusan Warren at \n susanwarren@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CME Group Inc. was 30.092390060424805 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CME Group Inc. was ",
