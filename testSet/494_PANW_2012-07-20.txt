Emerging Force  While shares of Internet companies such as Facebook,\n Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  and  Zynga Inc.

The global market for enterprise network security may rise\nto $12.5 billion by 2015 from $10 billion this year, Palo Alto\nsaid in its filing, citing IDC.  Kayak, which first filed to go public in November 2010, is\nthe first U.S. consumer Internet company to go public since\nFacebook\u2019s IPO in May.
