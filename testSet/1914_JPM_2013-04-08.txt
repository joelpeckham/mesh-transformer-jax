 "context": "The following article called 'Indonesia Markets Dollar Debt; Japan Bond Risk Drops to 2010 Low' was published on 2013-04-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRepublic of  Indonesia , CIFI Holdings\nGroup Co. and Bank of Ceylon are marketing U.S. dollar-\ndenominated notes. Bond risk in Japan fell to the lowest in 2\n1/2 years after the central bank took steps last week to fight\ndeflation.  Indonesia is considering selling 10-year notes at a yield\nof about 3.625 percent and 30-year securities at about 4.95\npercent, according to a person familiar with the matter who\nasked not to be identified because the terms aren\u2019t set. CIFI\nHoldings, a Shanghai-based developer, is offering five-year\nbonds at about 12.5 percent while Bank of Ceylon is marketing\nsimilar-maturity notes at about 5.5 percent, other people said.  Asia-Pacific borrowers are returning to the U.S. currency\nbond market after pausing note sales last week amid holidays in\n China  and Hong Kong. Average yield premiums on dollar debt in\nAsia fell to a four-week low of 4.29 percent on April 5,\naccording to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. The cost of insuring\ncorporate bonds in Japan against non-payment extended declines\nto the least since November 2010 even as South Korea\u2019s\ngovernment said North Korea may detonate a nuclear device and\ncarry out a missile test as early as this week.  \u201cThe pipeline of prospective U.S. dollar deals is\ncontinuing to grow,\u201d said Mark Reade, a Hong Kong-based credit\ndesk analyst at Credit Agricole CIB. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise a number\nof issuers have chosen to brave the North Korea-led volatility\nin an effort to gain first-mover advantage post the Easter\nholiday break.\u201d  Japanese Bonds  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index fell 4 basis points to 92\nbasis points as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup\nInc. prices. The drop follows a 7.7-basis-point slide on April\n5, according to data provider CMA.  Bank of Japan officials said April 4 the central bank will\nincrease its monthly bond purchases to 7.5 trillion yen ($76.1\nbillion), exceeding the 5.2 trillion yen forecast by economists\nsurveyed by Bloomberg. They also suspended a cap on some bond\nholdings, dropped a limit on debt maturities and set a two-year\nhorizon for their goal of 2 percent inflation.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index fell 1.5 basis points to\n117.9 basis points as of 10:08 a.m. in Sydney, according to\nWestpac Banking Corp. prices. The benchmark is on track for its\nlowest close since the current series of the index started\ntrading on March 20, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-\nHill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private\nmarket.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade\nborrowers outside Japan fell 1 to 121 basis points as of 8:48\na.m. in Hong Kong, Westpac prices show. The measure last closed\nlower on April 4.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring\nbonds against default and traders use them to speculate on\ncredit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of\ncreditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for\nthe underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt\nagreements.
