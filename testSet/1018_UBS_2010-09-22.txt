The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe increase in the ratio of rising\nto falling shares on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index to the\nhighest level since May is fuelling concern of a slide in\nequities, according to the top-ranked UBS AG technical analysis\nteam.  A fall of less than 1 percent on the S&P 500 will breach a\nkey support level at 1,129 that may also prompt further selling,\nUBS analysts  Michael Riesner  and  Marc Muller  wrote in a report\nyesterday. The American Association of Individual Investors\nsurvey of investor sentiment that showed a 51 percent jump in\nbullish readings also shows UBS that the rally is \u201crunning out\nof steam.\u201d The proportion of advancing to declining shares\nclimbed Sept. 20 to the highest since May 13.  \u201cWe see headwind for equities,\u201d Riesner wrote in the\nreport. \u201cWe continue to see the risk of another but significant\ntactical down leg into October. The likelihood is increasing\nthat we will see a re-test of the July low.\u201d  The S&P 500 has surged 11 percent from this year\u2019s low on\nJuly 2 as concern eased that American unemployment, which is\nnear the highest since the 1980s, and less spending from\nindebted European nations would stall the global economic\nrecovery. The gauge has gained 2.2 percent so far this year,\nleaving it 6.4 percent below its peak for 2010 when it closed\nyesterday at 1,139.78 in New York.  Riesner and Muller are part of UBS\u2019s winning team in this\nyear\u2019s Thomson Extel survey for equity technical analysis and\ncharting in Europe.
