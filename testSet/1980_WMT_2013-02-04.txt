 "context": "The following article called 'Argentine Markets Freeze Prices for 60-Days Amid 26% Inflation' was published on 2013-02-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nArgentine supermarkets, including\nlocal units of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,  Carrefour SA (CA)  and  Cencosud\nSA (CENCOSUD)  agreed to freeze prices for 60 days amid inflation that\naccelerated last year to the highest in the hemisphere.  The United Supermarkets Association agreed to keep prices\nunchanged in their stores until April 1 during a meeting today\nwith Interior Trade Secretary Guillermo Moreno in Buenos Aires,\naccording to a statement from the Argentine Chamber of Commerce.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has defended her\ngovernment\u2019s official data that shows consumer prices rose 10.8\npercent last year compared with private estimates of 25.6\npercent. The government\u2019s alleged underreporting of inflation,\nwhich began under Fernandez\u2019s predecessor and husband,  Nestor Kirchner , prompted the  International Monetary Fund  to censure\nthe South American nation on Feb. 1 for the first time in the\nWashington-based organization\u2019s history.  \u201cThey\u2019re trying to hold down inflation, but we\u2019ll see what\nhappens once the agreement ends,\u201d said Susana Andrada, director\nof Buenos Aires-based consumer watchdog Center for Consumer\nEducation in a telephone interview. \u201cThey may be able to\ncontrol prices of 300 goods, but then we may face some shortages\nas retailers keep goods off the shelves.\u201d  IMF Censure  Fernandez has used price freezes as recently as two years\nago to try to keep prices stable, a policy that hasn\u2019t worked\nand that led to some shortages in the past, according to\nAndrada. Argentines see prices rising 30 percent over the next\n12 months, according to a poll released Jan. 16 by Torcuato Di\nTella University.  While the IMF\u2019s censuring of  Argentina  won\u2019t have an\nimmediate effect, it takes the country a step closer to\nsanctions that include expulsion. In response to the censure,\nArgentina said that a nationwide inflation index will be\nunveiled in the fourth quarter of this year.  Opposition lawmakers, who began to release private\nestimates to protect economists from fines for calculating their\nown indexes in May 2011, are scheduled to release January\u2019s\ninflation on Feb. 14.  Andrada said that consumers foresee higher prices given the\ndrop of the peso in the parallel market where Argentines turn to\npurchase foreign currency when they can\u2019t get approval to buy\ndollars at the official rate.  While the official rate for the peso fell 13 percent in the\npast 12 months to 4.9818 per dollar, the currency in the blue\nchip-swap, an operation used to buy and swap assets traded in\nArgentine pesos and U.S. dollars, has weakened 40 percent to\n7.8043 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
