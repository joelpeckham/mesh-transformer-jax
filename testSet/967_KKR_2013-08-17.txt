 "context": "The following article called 'Luminant Sued by EPA Over Texas Clean Air Violation Claims' was published on 2013-08-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLuminant Generation Co., the largest\npower generator in  Texas , was sued by the U.S. Environmental\nProtection Agency over air-pollution standards for two power\nplants.  The enforcement action, which was filed under seal in\nfederal court in Dallas, follows two earlier EPA notices of\nviolations of the U.S. Clean Air Act by the Big Brown plant in\nFreestone County and the Martin Lake plant, located in Rusk and\nPanola counties.  Energy Future Holdings Corp., Luminant\u2019s closely held\nparent company, disclosed the EPA violation notices in its Aug.\n2 regulatory filing.  \u201cWe are in the process of evaluating the allegations\noutlined in the suit, but we firmly believe that we have\ncomplied with all requirements of the Clean Air Act for the Big\nBrown and Martin Lake power plants,\u201d Meranda Cohn, a\nspokeswoman for Luminant, said in an e-mailed statement.  Stacy Kika, an EPA spokeswoman, referred questions to the\nJustice Department. Wyn Hornbuckle, a U.S. Justice Department\nspokesman, declined to comment.  Energy Future, based in  Dallas , has asked the U.S. Court of\nAppeals in New Orleans to review both EPA notices, which allege\nthe pair of coal-burning plants failed to obtain certain\npermits, according to company filings.  Pollution Controls  \u201cWhile dozens of other utilities nationwide are investing\nin clean energy, installing modern pollution controls to reduce\npollution and retire aging coal plants, Luminant stands out as\none of the nation\u2019s very worst actors,\u201d Nia Martin-Robinson, a\nspokeswoman for the  Sierra Club \u2019s Beyond Coal  campaign  in Texas,\nsaid in a statement. \u201cIt burns the dirtiest possible coal --\nknown as lignite -- and has repeatedly refused to install modern\npollution controls.\u201d  Energy Future was formed in 2007 when investors led by\n Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) , TPG and Goldman Sachs Capital\nPartners bought TXU Corp. and took it private.  Energy Future said Aug. 2 that it\u2019s in talks with creditors\nand is evaluating changes to its capital structure that include\na voluntarily filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for some or all\nof the company, excluding power line-unit Oncor Electric\nDelivery.  Energy Future\u2019s total debt was $43.55 billion at the end of\nJune, according to a filing.  The case is U.S. v. Luminant Generation Co., 3:13-3236,\nU.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas).
