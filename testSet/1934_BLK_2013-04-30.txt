 "context": "The following article called 'BlackRock Asks Slovenia Bad-Bank Details Before Debt Sale' was published on 2013-04-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBlackRock Inc (BLK) ., the world\u2019s biggest investor, is asking Slovenia to provide details of a project to rescue banks as the government delayed pricing of its first long-term debt this year and Moody\u2019s Investors Service lowered the country to junk.  The nation needs to recapitalize its ailing banking industry with as much as 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) and fund the budget as the government works out details of a so-called bad bank plan to restructure the industry. The country is grappling with its second recession since 2009, with the export- driven  economy  forecast to contract again this year, according to a Bloomberg survey.  \u201cWe need to see the size of the assets that actually will be transferred,\u201d  Christopher Allen , a London-based director at BlackRock\u2019s Fundamental Euro Fixed Income team, said yesterday. \u201cWe have to understand whether the valuations of those loans are really realistic.\u201d  Moody\u2019s cut Slovenia\u2019s debt rating two steps to Ba1, the highest non-investment grade ranking, citing the ongoing turmoil in the country\u2019s banking system and the \u201chigh likelihood\u201d that the sovereign will be required to provide further assistance and capital injections.  Pricing for dollar-denominated bonds was delayed due to a possible credit rating action, the  Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement before the downgrade. Slovenia \u201cexpects the transaction to continue once additional information is available,\u201d it said.  Bond Offering  The yield on the government\u2019s existing dollar note due 2022 rose two basis points to 5.66 percent at 7:10 p.m. in Ljubljana. The rate on the notes sold in October peaked at 6.38 percent on March 27 as investors speculated Slovenia will be the next euro country to seek an international bailout after Cyprus.  The cost to protect Slovenia\u2019s government debt against default using credit-default swaps was little changed at 290 basis points today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors often ignore ratings, evidenced by the rally in Treasuries after the U.S. lost its top grade at  Standard & Poor\u2019s  in 2011.  Slovenia was offering five-year and 10-year dollar bonds today, said a person familiar with the matter earlier today who asked not to be identified before the transaction is completed. The five-year notes were being initially offered in the 5 percent area and the longer-maturity debt around 6.125 percent, the person said.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are arranging the deal after they gauged appetite for a bond sale with a roadshow that ended in  London  yesterday, the Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  Bank Project  Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek, whose Cabinet has pledged to push forward with the previous government\u2019s bad-bank project which involved moving as much as 4 billion euros of nonperforming debt out of lenders, has also said that it wants to sell state assets, including a bank, to calm concerns over the country\u2019s rising debt levels.  \u201cDespite the headlines from the new government broadly stating their commitment, we still need the details, hopefully ahead of proceeding with any bond sale,\u201d Allen said in an interview yesterday.  Adrian Russell, a London-based spokesman at BlackRock, declined further comment on the deal today.  Public Debt  Public debt, which was at 54 percent of gross domestic product last year, may rise to about 75 percent after the recapitalization of the banking sector, he said. That compared with the average 90.6 percent debt to GDP ratio for the euro area, according to Eurostat data.  \u201cThere are no major imbalances in Slovenia apart from the banking sector,\u201d said Allen. The public debt ratios are \u201caffordable by any means,\u201d he said.  Slovenia\u2019s economy will probably shrink 1.9 percent this year, according to the median of seven estimates in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Gross domestic product contracted 2.3 percent last year as demand for its goods in  Europe  ebbed and consumption dropped because of government austerity.
