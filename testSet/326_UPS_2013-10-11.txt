 "context": "The following article called 'Microsoft\u2019s Frankly Speaking Thompson Guides Quest for CEO: Tech' was published on 2013-10-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWeeks before  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chief\nExecutive Officer  Steve Ballmer  announced plans to retire, lead\nindependent director  John Thompson  spelled out the board\u2019s\nresponsibility in an on-campus interview.  \u201cOurs is not a role where we devise the strategy,\u201d\nThompson told Microsoft\u2019s internal  Channel 9  site on Aug. 7.\n\u201cOur role is really to say, \u2018Here\u2019s what we think about what\nwe\u2019ve heard, here\u2019s what we like, quite frankly, here\u2019s what we\ndon\u2019t like.\u201d  During Thompson\u2019s almost 20 months on Microsoft\u2019s board,\ndirectors were frank about what they didn\u2019t like about the\ncompany\u2019s performance under Ballmer, regulatory filings show.\nThe board, in annual reviews, rebuked the CEO for poor results\nin Windows and tablets machines, even as it lauded areas such as\nserver software and expense cutting. They paid him less than his\nmaximum possible bonus.  Thompson combined candor with his experience as a 42-year\ntechnology industry veteran to lead the board\u2019s discussion of\ncompany strategy, helping to create an environment that sped\nBallmer\u2019s decision to retire, according to people with knowledge\nof the matter. Thompson, 64, listened to each board member and\nmade sure Ballmer heard them, improving lines of communication\nand making strategy talks more productive, the people said.  Diplomacy Skills  Thompson, the former CEO of  Symantec Corp. (SYMC) , will now have\nto bring those skills of diplomacy and focus to bear as he leads\nMicrosoft\u2019s board in search of a new CEO. The task is urgent,\nwith Ballmer set to retire no later than August and the board\nworking toward having his successor in place by the end of the\nyear, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.  Microsoft has only had two CEOs -- co-founder  Bill Gates \nand Ballmer -- in its 38-year history. As Ballmer prepares to\nexit, the Redmond, Washington-based company is getting ready to\nintegrate Nokia Oyj\u2019s handset business, which Microsoft agreed\nto buy for $7.2 billion to take on  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Google Inc. in\nsmartphones and tablets. It\u2019s also grappling with the transition\nfrom a  software company  to one with a bigger footprint in\ndevices and services.  Gates, 57, remains chairman of the board and Microsoft\u2019s\nthird-biggest shareholder. He and Ballmer have been close\nfriends since college and crafted the strategy that led to\nMicrosoft\u2019s PC dominance.  Potential Candidates  So far, directors have spoken with  Alan Mulally  from Ford\nMotor Co., Nokia\u2019s Stephen Elop and Microsoft business\ndevelopment chief Tony Bates, as well as Paul Maritz, the\ncompany\u2019s former No. 3 executive, the people said. Some\ncandidates have declined to be considered, including EBay Inc.\nCEO  John Donahoe , said two people. Ford reiterated yesterday\nthat Mulally plans to stay on through the end of 2014.  Microsoft spokesman  Frank Shaw  declined to comment or to\nmake Thompson available for an interview.  Against that backdrop, Thompson and the board are\ndeliberating between an outsider with a fresh perspective or an\nexperienced insider. In addition, they face decisions on whether\nto trim Microsoft\u2019s many businesses and focus on becoming a\npurely enterprise or consumer technology company, or continue\nBallmer\u2019s attempts to straddle both.  Those who know Thompson say he is up to the challenge. \u201cIf\nI was to pick a guy to handle that kind of delicate situation --\nwell, John is great at it -- soft-spoken but very deliberate in\nwhat he says and when he talks, people listen,\u201d said Ed Zander,\nformer CEO of Motorola Inc., who served on the board of storage-drive maker Seagate Technology Plc with Thompson from 2009 to\n2011. \u201cHe understands the challenge Microsoft has.\u201d  Previous Struggles  Thompson also knows what it\u2019s like to be at the head of a\nstruggling incumbent. While at Symantec in 2005, he orchestrated\nthe ill-fated $10.2 billion purchase of Veritas Software Corp.,\nin an effort to push into data storage. When Thompson stepped\ndown as CEO four years later, Symantec was contending with\nslowing growth amid an economic downturn and rising competition.  Thompson joined Microsoft as a director in 2012 as part of\nan expansion of the board. At the time, directors had already\nraised questions about Ballmer\u2019s strategy, yet had been patient\nin waiting for it to bear fruit, said a person familiar with the\nmatter. The addition of Thompson and Seagate CEO Steve Luczo\nthat year gave the board more technology expertise and helped\nreassure longer-serving directors that they were correct to\npress Ballmer, the person said.  Building Consensus  Ballmer separately was mulling the timing of his departure.\nThompson eased the process because he built consensus among\ndifferent viewpoints and helped get the board and Ballmer\ncomfortable with a retirement timeline, people familiar with the\nsituation said. Thompson shored up communication between Ballmer\nand the board, making sure the CEO heard all voices, they said.  Thompson also has experience running a CEO search. In 2007,\nhe played the lead role in helping United Parcel Service Inc.\nselect Scott Davis to replace Mike Eskew, a popular 35-year\ncompany veteran.  \u201cHe\u2019s already cut his eyeteeth on this for UPS,\u201d said\n Stuart Eizenstat , a former deputy Treasury Secretary and UPS\nboard member. \u201cHe was able to touch base with everybody, was\nable to bring everybody to a consensus we were all satisfied\nwith and it proved to be a terrific choice.\u201d  The son of a Florida postal worker and a teacher, Thompson\njoined International Business Machines Corp. straight out of\nFlorida A&M University in 1971. The IBM interviewer said he was\ninterested in a stereo, so Thompson spent the session trying to\nsell him one, Thompson wrote in a  New York  Times  column  last\nyear. He wound up with a job as a sales rep for IBM in Tampa.  Technology Career  Thompson likes to tell people he spent \u201c27 years, 9 months\nand 13 days at IBM\u201d before joining technology-security company\nSymantec as CEO in 1999. He took the company from $600 million\nto $6 billion in  sales  over his decade-long tenure, before\nstepping down in 2009.  Thompson currently runs Virtual Instruments Inc., a  San\nJose , California-based maker of software that tracks application\nand hardware performance. On his second day there he realized\nthe company was out of cash. Now, Thompson said he\u2019s heading for\nan initial public offering.  It took some convincing to get Thompson to run a startup\nafter a career at big companies. He accepted the job partially\nbecause board member Jim Davidson, a managing director at\nprivate-equity firm  Silver Lake , told him he needed to oversee\nan IPO.  As Thompson recounted in a July interview, Davidson said,\n\u201cJohn, you\u2019ve had a wonderful career. But you\u2019re going to\ndeclare yourself a failure if you don\u2019t do an IPO at some point\nin your life.\u201d  Microsoft Incursion  One thing Thompson has experienced is Microsoft\u2019s\naggressiveness. At IBM, he ran the OS/2 operating system\nbusiness as it lost to Microsoft\u2019s Windows in the 1990s. At\nSymantec, he fended off Microsoft\u2019s incursion into the antivirus\nmarket. Upon joining the board, his friends from the IBM days\nreminded him of those stories and wondered why he would help his\nlongtime rival.  \u201cThis is one of the true iconic companies, not just in\ntech, but in our country,\u201d Thompson told Microsoft\u2019s Channel 9,\nfrom its Skype office in  Palo Alto ,  California . \u201cIf there\u2019s an\nopportunity to serve in some small way to help this company use\nwhat I\u2019ve learned over my 42 years in this industry, why\nwouldn\u2019t I want to do that?\u201d  Thompson doesn\u2019t want the Microsoft CEO job and wouldn\u2019t be\nleading the search committee if he did, said one of the people\nwith knowledge of the matter.  Large Rolodex  With Thompson off the list, he must look for someone with\nsimilar stature. Because of the scope of Microsoft\u2019s challenges,\nhe\u2019ll need someone who can tap the skills and expertise of\nothers, said a person familiar with the situation.  Steve Miller , chairman of American International Group Inc.\nand a Symantec board member, said Thompson\u2019s rolodex will help\nhim in that quest.  \u201cThere\u2019s probably only 10 individuals on the planet who\ncan run Microsoft, given the size of the company and the\ncomplexity,\u201d Miller said. \u201cJohn would know all of them\npersonally.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDina Bass in Seattle at \n dbass2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nPui-Wing Tam at \n ptam13@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of United Parcel Service, Inc. was 70.86039733886719 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of United Parcel Service, Inc. was ",
