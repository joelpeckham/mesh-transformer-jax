 "context": "The following article called 'RBA's Stevens Weighs Rate Increase With Australian Economy in `Sweet Spot'' was published on 2010-10-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nReserve Bank of Australia policy\nmakers will weigh slower inflation and weaker business credit\nagainst accelerating employment when they meet tomorrow to\ndecide whether to resume raising interest rates.  Seventeen of 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News\nexpect Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his board to leave the\novernight cash rate target at 4.5 percent, with the others\npredicting an increase to 4.75 percent. The decision is\nscheduled for 2:30 p.m. tomorrow in Sydney.  With consumer prices inside the central bank\u2019s target range,\nStevens has the option of leaving the rate untouched for a sixth\nmonth or tightening policy before wages and other costs start to\nrise. Australia is undergoing a mining boom that International\nMonetary Fund staff last week said is starting to exhibit\n\u201cearly signs\u201d of inflation pressures.  \u201cThe economy is at a \u2018sweet spot,\u2019 but history tells us it\nwon\u2019t stay there long, with inflation likely to be picking up\nsoon,\u201d said  Paul Bloxham , chief economist for Australia and New\nZealand at HSBC Holdings Plc in Sydney and a former RBA official.\nHe predicts the RBA will wait until its Dec. 7 meeting to raise.  Traders estimated a 22 percent chance Stevens would raise\nthe benchmark rate tomorrow, according to Bloomberg calculations\nbased on interbank  futures  on the Sydney Futures Exchange at\n10:28 a.m. The odds of a rise next month were 40 percent.  \u2018Finely Balanced\u2019  The central bank signaled after its Oct. 5 meeting that the\ndecision to leave borrowing costs unchanged was \u201cfinely\nbalanced\u201d with the case for an increase, as a rising currency\nhelped ease inflation concerns. Most economists had forecast a\nquarter percentage-point increase at that meeting.  Since the October meeting, the Australian dollar has gained\nabout 1.5 percent. It surged toward parity with the U.S.\ncurrency through the first half of the month after an Oct. 7\nreport showed the biggest back-to-back monthly job increases\nsince 1988. It fell 1.4 percent on Oct. 27 after a report showed\nconsumer prices rose less than forecast last quarter.  A private survey today showed Australian manufacturing\ncontracted in October for a second month as the stronger\ncurrency eroded demand for exports.  The RBA\u2019s decision this week comes a day before the U.S.\n Federal Reserve , which has kept its benchmark interest rate near\nzero since December 2008, announces its next policy move, and\nthe same day as the Reserve Bank of India, which has raised\nrates five times this year, decides on its borrowing costs.  3.5% Expansion  Australia\u2019s  unemployment rate , at 5.1 percent in September,\nis about half the level of joblessness in the U.S. and euro zone.\nThe IMF predicts growth will accelerate next year to 3.5 percent\nfrom 3 percent this year.  \u201cWith a strong outlook, we expect the next move to be in\nDecember, following more confirmation of accelerating growth,\u201d\nBloxham said.  IMF staff said in a report last week that the RBA will need\nto raise rates to reduce inflation should Australia\u2019s mining-\ndriven recovery proceed and risks to the global economic outlook\ndissipate.  \u201cThe RBA agreed that if the downside risks to the outlook\ndiminished and further inflation pressures emerged, the policy\nrate would need to be raised,\u201d IMF staff said as part of an\nannual consultation, called an Article IV review, on Oct. 29.  Inflation Gauge  A private  gauge  of Australia\u2019s inflation accelerated last\nmonth at the fastest pace in two years as costs rose for\nautomotive fuel, insurance and food. Consumer prices increased\n3.8 percent in October from a year earlier, according to an\nindex compiled by TD Securities Ltd. and the Melbourne Institute\nreleased in Sydney today. Prices increased 0.3 percent from a\nmonth earlier.  The nation\u2019s  consumer price index  rose 0.7 percent from the\nsecond quarter, less than the 0.8 percent median estimate of\neconomists, a government report showed Oct. 27. Prices gained\n2.8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.  The  central bank  aims to keep inflation in a range of 2\npercent to 3 percent on average.  Bank Lending  A report last week showed loans provided by  Australian\nbanks  and finance companies rose 0.1 percent in September from\nthe previous month, while lending to companies fell 0.9 percent\nfrom August and 3.7 percent from a year earlier.  Even so, Australia is undergoing a hiring boom as companies\nsuch as BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group increase shipments\nof iron ore and coal to China.  Data released last week showed prices paid to Australian\nproducers rose 1.3 percent in the third quarter, the most in\nalmost two years, and an Oct. 7 report revealed that Australian\nemployers in September added the most workers in eight months.  The IMF staff estimated the Australian dollar is \u201cmildly\novervalued\u201d by 5 percent to 15 percent in the medium term,\nwhile adding that the increase is likely to be temporary and may\ndissipate with more normal interest rates in the U.S. and other\nadvanced economies.  Australia\u2019s biggest banks have signaled they may need to\nraise interest rates by more than the cash rate to make up for\nhigher funding costs. That prompted opposition Liberal-National\ncoalition treasury spokesman  Joe Hockey  to call for lenders to\nbe prevented from increasing rates above any RBA move, saying\nthe banks have \u201cmore power than at any other time.\u201d  Profits  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. said Oct. 28 its\nsecond-half profit jumped 69 percent to a record, partly on a\nrise in lending to home buyers, and a day earlier National\nAustralia Bank Ltd. announced a 32 percent rise in second-half\ncash profit.  Michael Smith , ANZ\u2019s chief executive officer, said in\nresponse to Hockey\u2019s comments that it was a \u201cshame\u201d the\ncoalition, which had a \u201cvery good track record on economic\nmanagement,\u201d would suggest regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s pure populism,\u201d\nSmith said.  Whatever the outcome of tomorrow\u2019s RBA meeting, it will be\na \u201cclose call,\u201d said  Stephen Walters , chief economist at\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. in Sydney, who forecasts a quarter-point\nincrease. \u201cThere is a material risk the RBA waits until\nDecember before hiking again.\u201d  \nTo contact the reporters for this story:\n Michael Heath  in Sydney at \n mheath1@bloomberg.net ;\n Daniel Petrie  in Sydney at \n dpetrie5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChris Anstey in Tokyo at  canstey@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 27.79491424560547 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
