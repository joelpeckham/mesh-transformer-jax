The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee leaders said on Thursday they will hold a series of hearings in coming months looking at what they see as serious threats from China, continuing strong calls in Congress for tough dealings with Beijing.\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 24, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \u201cChina has only become emboldened and now may be the pre-eminent threat to American security, our economy and our values,\u201d U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, said at a hearing focused on China\u2019s military expansion.\nHe said the committee would also look at issues including China\u2019s efforts \u201cboth legal and illicit\u201d to acquire national security technology and U.S. intellectual property, its \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d and its technology strategy.\nThe public hearing - unusual for a committee that conducts most of its business behind closed doors - took place the same day as Washington and Beijing were launching a second round of talks to try to avert a trade war.\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, said he hoped the panel would hold more public hearings related to China, particularly focusing on cyber security threats.\nAhead of those talks, members of Congress, including President Donald Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans, have been pushing back on suggestions that Trump might ease a clampdown on one major Chinese company, telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp, in exchange for eased agricultural tariffs.\n\u201cWe need to consider that the military challenge is part of a larger national strategy by China to project its power and to secure its national interests by whatever means necessary,\u201d Schiff said.\nHe said that included sales of \u201cpotentially compromising\u201d telecommunications equipment in the United States by ZTE and Huawei [HWT.UL], another major Chinese company.\nU.S. intelligence agencies have warned that ZTE\u2019s products pose a threat to U.S. cyber security, alleging that they could be used to spy on Americans or steal intellectual property.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. was 8.9047212600708 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. was ",
