The company, a provider of infrastructure projects in Britain and internationally, has been fighting for survival after costly contract delays and a downturn in new business. \nThe 200-year old group, which employs 43,000 people, said on Saturday that it would meet creditors on Wednesday to discuss a financial rescue plan. \nCarillion\u2019s shares had risen sharply on Monday after a report by Sky News said the rescue plan could include government financial support if the company could not secure private funding. \nSky News said on Thursday that The Pensions Regulator (TPR) and government officials would hold talks on Friday about Carillion\u2019s 580 million pounds ($781.90 million) pension deficit. \nA TPR spokesperson said they \u201chave been and remain closely involved in discussions with Carillion and the trustees of the pension schemes as this situation has unfolded.\u201d \nBritain\u2019s Pension Protection Fund said it was aware of discussions between Carillion, government and banks as well as with the company\u2019s pension fund trustees and The Pensions Regulator, but did not provide more details. \nThe company secretary of the Carillion Pension Plan Trustees Ltd was not immediately available to comment when contacted by Reuters. \nA government spokesperson said: \u201cThe company has kept us informed of the steps it is taking to restructure the business. We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress.\u201d \nCabinet office minister Oliver Dowden said on Wednesday that the government was making \u201ccontingency plans for all eventualities\u201d related to Carillion which is working on the HS2 high speed rail link between London and Birmingham and helps to maintain Britain\u2019s roads, schools and hospitals. \nUnite, Britain largest trade union, said the government must consider all possible options, including bringing contracts in-house. \nThe company, which also operates in Canada and the Middle East, made losses of more than 1 billion pounds in the first half of 2016. \nAnalysts estimate Carillion has debt and liabilities including provisions, pensions and accounts payable of as much as 1.5 billion pounds when its market capitalisation has slumped to under 100 million pounds - less than a tenth of what it was this time last year. \nIn December, Carillion said discussions with stakeholders about its options to cut debt and avoid a breach of debt covenants were \u201cprogressing well\u201d. \nThe Wolverhampton-based firm has been selling assets to cut debt but its problems have been compounded by pension obligations and delays in collecting cash from clients. \nAfter the financial crisis, British construction companies bid low prices for long-running, fixed-price contracts to keep work coming in. This left them exposed whenever the projects faced delays or bigger than expected costs. \nThe broader industry is also suffering from delays in public spending decisions as Britain negotiates its departure from the European Union. \nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is investigating whether Carillion appropriately disclosed its financial position in the run up to a series of profit warnings issued in the past six months. \nLast month, Carillion brought forward the start date for new chief executive Andrew Davies to Jan. 22. Davies, head of family-owned builder Wates Group and formerly with defence company BAE Systems, will replace interim CEO Keith Cochrane. \n($1 = 0.7418 pounds) Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru and Simon Jessop in London; Editing by Keith Weir and Jane Merriman\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Tapestry, Inc. was 40.656124114990234 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Tapestry, Inc. was ",
