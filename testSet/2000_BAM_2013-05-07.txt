The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBlackstone Group LP (BX)  plans to sell 23.4\nmillion shares of  General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , exiting its\ninvestment in the second-biggest U.S. mall owner after helping\nthe company emerge from bankruptcy in 2010.  Blackstone funds will sell the shares, equal to a 2.5\npercent  stake , in a secondary offering, Chicago-based General\nGrowth said in a statement today. General Growth won\u2019t receive\nany proceeds from the sale, according to a regulatory filing.  Blackstone, based in  New York , joined investors led by\n Brookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A)  and  Bill Ackman \u2019s Pershing\nSquare Capital Management LP to bring General Growth out of\nbankruptcy in November 2010. A surge in the landlord\u2019s  shares \nand rising property valuations since then may have prompted the\nprivate-equity firm to decide it was a good time to sell, said\nCraig Guttenplan, a real estate investment trust analyst with\nCreditSights Inc. in London.  \u201cBlackstone has made a nice profit on its investment and\nin order to perform for their shareholders, they look for\nliquidity events,\u201d Paul Adornato, an analyst with BMO Capital\nMarkets in New York, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s good\nfor GGP shareholders because it eliminates this overhang down\nthe road.\u201d  Stock Advance  General Growth gained 75 percent from its bankruptcy exit\nthrough today. Since its restructuring, the company has\nredeveloped properties and focused on its best-quality malls.  The stock fell 2.2 percent today to $22.82 at the close in\nNew York.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for Blackstone, didn\u2019t immediately\nreturn a message seeking comment on the sale.  In January, General Growth purchased $633 million of\nwarrants to buy its shares from Blackstone and Fairholme Funds\nInc., which was also part of the investment group.  Brookfield, based in Toronto, is General Growth\u2019s largest\ninvestor, holding about 40 percent of the outstanding stock,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based Pershing\nowns almost 8 percent of the shares.
