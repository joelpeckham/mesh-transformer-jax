 "context": "The following article called 'Queensland Backs Fortescue Challenge on Australia Tax' was published on 2012-07-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia \u2019s resource-rich Queensland\nstate said it will support  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) \u2019s bid to\nsue the federal government in the country\u2019s top court over a\nplan to tax  iron ore  and coal company profits.  \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly have a go at intervening in this case,\u201d\nAttorney General Jarrod Bleijie told Australian Broadcasting\nCorp. radio today. While cases in the high court are difficult\nto win, Queensland received legal advice that the Mineral\nResource and Rent Tax, implemented July 1, may be\nunconstitutional as it discriminates between states, he said.  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard , who is meeting Queensland\nPremier  Campbell Newman  in Brisbane today, needs revenue from\nthe tax as she bids to turn the budget to surplus by next year,\nwhen she\u2019s due to hold an election that polls show she\u2019s on\ncourse to lose. Her minority Labor government\u2019s agenda has drawn\ncriticism from mining companies including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and\n Rio Tinto  Group and resistance from the leaders of the four\nstates out of six ruled by the Liberal-National opposition.  \u201cThere\u2019s a stronger political game being played here than\na legal one,\u201d Michael Adams, dean of law at the University of\nWestern Sydney, said in a phone interview today. \u201cIt\u2019ll be very\nhard for Queensland to show it\u2019s been unfairly discriminated\nagainst.\u201d Adams said the legislation appears to have been\ncarefully crafted to withstand constitutional challenges and\nseems to be \u201crock solid.\u201d  The tax will reap about A$10.6 billion ($10.8 billion)\nwithin three years from Fortescue, BHP, Rio Tinto and other\nmining companies, according to Treasury estimates in October.  Swan\u2019s Defense  The challenge \u201cwill try to stop the Gillard government\nspreading the benefits of the mining boom to hundreds of\nthousands of Queensland households and small businesses who\naren\u2019t in the fast lane\u201d of the nation\u2019s economy, Treasurer\n Wayne Swan  said in an e-mailed statement today. He described the\nstate\u2019s bid as \u201cfutile.\u201d  Western Australian Premier  Colin Barnett  decided against\njoining Fortescue\u2019s challenge as it was unlikely to be\nsuccessful, Swan said.  Fortescue, the nation\u2019s third-biggest iron-ore exporter, is\nseeking a ruling declaring the tax invalid because it\ndiscriminates between states, curtails their sovereignty and\nrestricts their ability to encourage mining, the Perth-based\ncompany said in a court filing on June 22.  Newman, a former army lieutenant, lead his conservative\nLiberal-National Party to victory in March elections after\npledging to cut the resource-rich state\u2019s unemployment rate to 4\npercent from 5.7 percent and restore its AAA credit rating.\nLabor\u2019s defeat left Gillard with allies governing in just the\ntwo smallest of the nation\u2019s six states.  Abbott\u2019s Pledge  Tony Abbott , head of the opposition Liberal-National\ncoalition, has promised to scrap the mining tax if the Labor\ngovernment is defeated in the election, scheduled for the second\nhalf of next year.  Gillard\u2019s agenda, which includes a new tax on  carbon\nemissions  that will help fund cash handouts to lower- and\nmiddle-income voters, has prompted criticism by business leaders\nranging from BHP Chairman Jacques Nasser to Rio Tinto Chief\nExecutive Officer Tom Albanese to the Australian Chamber of\nCommerce and Industry.  Labor\u2019s primary vote fell 1 percentage point to 30 percent,\nwhile support for Abbott\u2019s Liberal-National coalition increased\n2 points to 46 percent, according to a Newspoll published in the\nAustralian newspaper on June 25.  Miners in states with lower rates of royalties than other\nstates will have to pay more federal tax, Fortescue said in its\ncourt filing last month. That would eliminate a state\u2019s\ncompetitive advantage, the company said.  \u2018Illusory, Inefficacious\u2019  The federal tax will \u201chave the effect of rendering\nillusory and inefficacious any determination by a state to\ndifferentiate itself from other states or countries,\u201d Fortescue\nsaid.  The company plans to almost triple annual iron-ore output\nfrom its Western Australian mines to 155 million metric tons by\nJune 2013.  Last year, the  High Court  struck down Gillard\u2019s plan to\nsend illegal immigrants who arrive by boat to Malaysia.  Tobacco\ncompanies  are challenging a law that would require cigarettes to\nbe sold in plain packages.  The case is between Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. and The\nCommonwealth of Australia. S163/2012. High Court of Australia\n(Sydney).
