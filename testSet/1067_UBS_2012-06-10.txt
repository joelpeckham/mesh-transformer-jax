 "context": "The following article called 'Geneva Sees Growth Warnings as Traffic Jams Impede Alpine Appeal' was published on 2012-06-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIvan Pictet, senior partner of\nGeneva\u2019s biggest private bank until 2010, is concerned the city\nwhere his family has lived for more than 600 years may be losing\nits appeal for multinational companies.  \u201cThere may be a lot of red lights appearing,\u201d said\nPictet, citing a housing shortage and transport bottlenecks. As\npresident of a foundation promoting the city, Pictet, 68,\ncommissioned a  study  to identify obstacles to economic growth in\nthe Lake Geneva region.  Geneva, less than a two-hour drive from the ski resorts of\nChamonix and Verbier, has used political stability, low taxes\nand quality of life to lure more than 900 multinationals,\nincluding  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  That\nattraction is threatened as a lack of housing combines with the\nstrength of the Swiss franc to boost costs and as Switzerland\nfaces pressure to scrap a tax benefitting foreign companies.  \u201cThere is a concern that we have limited resources in\nGeneva, and if we don\u2019t manage them correctly, it may lead to\nsome enterprises or organizations leaving,\u201d said Cedric Dupont,\na professor at the city\u2019s Graduate Institute who is overseeing\npart of the research for Pictet. \u201cSpace is limited, labor\nsupply is limited, schools are limited, and due to that prices\nare going up and Geneva may become less attractive.\u201d  Geneva\u2019s population growth is outpacing the expansion of\nits  property market , leading to a vacancy rate for all types of\naccommodation of just 0.25 percent as of last June, according to\n figures  from the canton\u2019s statistic office. That compares with\n2.2 percent in London.  Housing Crisis  \u201cWe\u2019re in a housing crisis here and everyone has to\naddress it,\u201d said Remy Pagani, a member of Geneva\u2019s ruling\ncouncil who takes over as mayor this month.  Pictet\u2019s study also will examine transport issues following\na 54 percent increase since 2004 in passenger traffic on the\nrailway between Geneva and Lausanne, the lake region\u2019s second\nbiggest city.  \u201cWe\u2019re lacking a third \u2018piste\u2019 on the highway and a third\nrail on the railroad system,\u201d said Pictet, adding that\nresearchers will also analyze the capacity of the Mont Blanc\nroad bridge and access to Geneva\u2019s airport.  Those bottlenecks and shortages helped make Geneva the\nworld\u2019s third-most expensive city behind Oslo and Zurich,\naccording to a UBS AG  survey  published last August. The position\nwas cemented by Europe\u2019s debt crisis, which pushed up the franc\nby more than 15 percent against the dollar and the euro over the\npast two years.  Tax Talks  \u201cWith the international crisis, the Swiss currency and the\nfactors associated with housing, we will attract fewer\ncompanies,\u201d said Daniel Loeffler, director of Geneva\u2019s Economic\nDevelopment Office.  The pressure on costs comes as the European Union pushes\n Switzerland  to abandon a so-called auxiliary  regime  that allows\nmultinationals to pay less tax on income from outside the\ncountry.  The regulations permit more than 70 commodity trading\ncompanies in the city to pay an average tax of 12 percent, said\nJacques-Olivier Thomann, president of the  Geneva Trading and\nShipping Association . EU pressure to replace that system with a\nsingle rate for all companies may deter investment, he said.  \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking to my clients, who are here for tax\nreasons mainly, they are very concerned about what\u2019s going to\nhappen in the next few years,\u201d said Thierry Boitelle, a partner\nat Geneva law firm Bonnard Lawson. \u201cThey may have to consider\nleaving Geneva for tax reasons.\u201d  New Regime  The EU expects progress this month on tax reform talks,\nsaid Emer Traynor, a Brussels-based spokeswoman for Taxation\nCommissioner Algirdas Semeta.  David Hiler, Geneva\u2019s finance minister, has said the city\nmay follow the neighboring canton of Neuchatel in lowering its\nstandard corporate  tax rate  to about 15 percent from 24.2\npercent to offset a potential phase out of the auxiliary regime.  \u201cThe problem is the canton can\u2019t reduce the rate too much\nwithout hurting the economy,\u201d said Denis Berdoz, a partner at\n Baker & McKenzie  in Geneva, who specializes in tax and corporate\nlaw. \u201cAbout 15 percent seems to be a target rate, which may be\ncompetitive compared with other European jurisdictions, but it\u2019s\nabove the rate many companies pay now.\u201d  In addition to EU pressure, Geneva\u2019s Socialist Party has\nthe 10,000 signatures needed to prompt a vote on whether to keep\nso-called tax holidays, which allow some foreign companies\narriving in the city to pay no cantonal tax for as long as 10\nyears, said Arnaud Moreillon, the party\u2019s secretary general.  Merck to RWE  Companies such as  Germany \u2019s Merck KGaA aren\u2019t waiting for\nthe outcome of the study or the vote.  Merck announced plans last month to close the Serono unit\nit bought from billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli in 2007, resulting\nin the loss of 1,250 jobs in Geneva. It was \u201cunsustainable\u201d to\nhave two centers for research and development in  Europe , said\nPhyllis Carter, a spokeswoman for the Darmstadt, Germany-based\ncompany. Merck expects the decision to help save about 300\nmillion euros by 2014.  RWE Supply & Trading GmbH, a unit of Germany\u2019s second-\nbiggest utility, said in January it will eliminate as many as\n100 of 160 jobs in Geneva to reduce costs, said Barbara Minderjahn, a spokeswoman for the Essen, Germany-based company.  Procter & Gamble, the biggest multinational employer in\nGeneva with 3,000 people, declined to say how many jobs will be\nlost in the city as part of a global plan to cut 5,700 non-\nmanufacturing positions by next June.  Changing Attitude  By contrast, Trafigura Beheer BV, which trades oil,\nminerals and metals, has shifted staff from  London  and Lucerne,\nSwitzerland, in the past two years to make Geneva its main hub\nwith about 400 employees.  While the findings of Pictet\u2019s study are set for release\nlater this year, he said signs are everywhere that times have\nchanged.  \u201cTwo years ago when a new multinational was establishing\nitself in the Lake Geneva region, you would have headlines in\nthe local newspaper saying \u2018wonderful, hooray, we\u2019ve made 300\njobs,\u2019\u201d Pictet said. \u201cToday there\u2019s been a little bit of a\nchange of attitude: \u2018Gosh, we\u2019ve got another one coming.\u2019\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nSimeon Bennett in Geneva at \n sbennett9@bloomberg.net ;\nGiles Broom in Geneva at   gbroom@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nPhil Serafino at   pserafino@bloomberg.net ;\nFrank Connelly at   fconnelly@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 7.471822261810303 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
