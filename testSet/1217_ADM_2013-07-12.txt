 "context": "The following article called 'House-Passed Farm Bill Deemed Flawed by Senate Democrats' was published on 2013-07-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA five-year farm-policy bill  House\nRepublicans  passed and sent to the  U.S. Senate  now faces\nopposition among the Democrats needed to craft the final law,\nmaking the party-line vote a potentially hollow victory.  The House plan was approved yesterday 216-208 without\nDemocratic support. The Republican measure severing food stamps\nfrom farm programs that were linked for decades makes the bill\n\u201cextremely flawed,\u201d said Senator  Debbie Stabenow , chairwoman\nof the Senate Agriculture Committee and the likely leader of\nthat chamber\u2019s negotiating team.  The bill \u201cis not a real farm bill and is an insult to\nrural America,\u201d the Michigan Democrat said in a statement.\nPresident  Barack Obama \u2019s administration has threatened a veto of\nthe plan were Congress to pass the scaled-back version, which\nwas debated three weeks after the House rejected a more\nexpensive measure.  Farm legislation, which benefit crop-buyers such as  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  and insurers including  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ,\nhas been working through Congress for almost two years. The\nSenate on June 10 passed S. 954, a plan that would cost $955\nbillion over a decade. Current law begins to expire Sept. 30.  The House plan\u2019s 10-year cost is $196 billion, according to\nthe  Congressional Budget Office , with the lower price reflecting\nelimination of food stamps, the bulk of U.S. Department of\nAgriculture spending authorized by the bill.  Food Stamps  House action has been stymied largely by disagreements on\nthe program. The legislation rejected last month, H.R. 1947,\nwould cut spending on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance\nProgram, responsible for more than three-quarters of the bill\u2019s\ncosts, by about 2.5 percent, roughly $2 billion a year.\nDemocrats who balked at the reductions joined Republicans\nobjecting to the plan\u2019s cost to scuttle the bill. Republican\nleaders revived the measure in scaled-back form.  The stripped-down plan gained support from Republicans\nwilling to deal with food stamps later. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret I am\nnot a fan of the farm bill,\u201d said Representative  Jeb Hensarling , a Texas Republican who opposed the June version and\nsupported the bill yesterday. \u201cI\u2019ve learned around here that\nyou rarely get to vote for success but you can vote for\nprogress.\u201d  Milk Prices  The revised version also removed language that effectively\nwould replace current law with policies set in 1938 and 1949\nwhen the law expired. The threat of reviving those old laws has\nhelped prod Congress to modernize farm-subsidy and farm-loan\nprograms, since the laws set terms that could double the\nwholesale price of milk starting next year. The House plan would\ndo away with that leverage, said Representative Michael Conaway,\na Texas Republican.  Beyond that, the bill is basically the same as the previous\nfarm-policy measure. It would end direct payments to U.S.\nfarmers and expand a crop insurance-based safety net.  Farm-policy legislation without food stamps has been\nopposed by groups, including the  American Farm Bureau\nFederation , the largest U.S. farmer organization. Last week,\nmore than 530 groups signed a letter of opposition to the plan.\nOther organizations, including the Texas Farm Bureau, the\nNational Cotton Council of America and the National Pork\nProducers Council, supported it.  Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, said the plan\nfell short both for farmers and food-stamp recipients, while\nSenator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from  North Dakota , said\nomitting food stamps to build House Republican support harms its\nchances of passing Congress.  Urban-Rural Coalition  \u201cAuthorizing nutrition policies in the farm bill is\nnecessary to maintaining the critical urban-rural coalition that\nhas been relied upon to pass farm bills for the past four\ndecades,\u201d Heitkamp said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cBreaking this\ncoalition and severing ties between farm and table is a mistake\nthat weakens the chances\u201d of any plan becoming law, she said.  Despite her misgivings, Stabenow said she was willing to\nwork with House lawmakers on their plan as part of a final law.\nWhile sidestepping  food stamps  for the moment, some small-government advocacy groups that have called for changing the\nprogram said they don\u2019t like the possibility that a later House-Senate conference committee could go its own way.  \u201cWe highly suspect that this whole process is a \u2018rope-a-dope\u2019 exercise\u201d of \u201csplitting up the farm bill only as a means\nto get to conference with the Senate where a bicameral back-room\ndeal will reassemble the commodity and food stamp titles,\nleaving us back where we started,\u201d one of those groups, the\nClub for Growth, said in a statement.  Still, simple approval of a plan that has struggled to get\nanywhere in the House was seen as a victory by some lawmakers.\n\u201cThank God we can do something,\u201d said Tom Rooney, a Florida\nRepublican, said as he walked off the House floor.  The House legislation is H.R. 2642.
