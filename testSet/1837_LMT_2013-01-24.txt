 "context": "The following article called 'Lockheed\u2019s 2013 Profit Forecast Exceeds Analyst Estimates' was published on 2013-01-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world\u2019s\nlargest defense contractor, forecast a 2013 profit exceeding\nanalysts\u2019 estimates after fourth-quarter earnings declined.  Lockheed said profit for the year will be $8.80 to $9.10 a\nshare on sales of $44.5 billion to $46 billion. The average\nestimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a profit of\n$8.28 a share on sales of $45.3 billion.  Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter\nwas $569 million, or $1.73 a share, compared with $698 million\nor $2.14 a share, a year earlier, the Bethesda, Maryland-based\ncompany said in a statement today. The average estimate of 21\nanalysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of $1.82 a\nshare.  Marillyn Hewson, who became Lockheed\u2019s chief executive\nofficer this month, faces the challenge of protecting the\ncompany\u2019s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter from budget cuts as Pentagon\nspending comes under pressure from efforts by Congress and the\nObama administration to reduce U.S. deficits.  The F-35 is the Pentagon\u2019s costliest weapons program, and\nthe company reached an agreement with the Pentagon last month on\ncontracts that would ensure continued production of the fighter\njet if automatic budget cuts take effect in March.  Still, the company must contend with continued uncertainty\nfrom the threatened cuts, Hewson said in the statement. U.S.\ndefense companies confront the prospect of across-the-board cuts\nin defense spending of $45 billion by Sept. 30 if Congress and\nPresident  Barack Obama  can\u2019t reach agreement on alternative\nspending reductions.
