 "context": "The following article called 'Swiss Voters Approve Limits on \u2018Fat Cat\u2019 Executive Pay' was published on 2013-03-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSwiss voters approved some of the\nworld\u2019s toughest limits on executives\u2019 pay in a referendum, a\nmove critics say could make Switzerland less attractive to\nmultinational corporations.  The initiative against \u201cfat cats,\u201d proposed by Thomas Minder, head of a herbal toothpaste company, was backed by 67.9\npercent of the voters today, the government  said  on its website\ntoday. The turnout was 46 percent. Polls, including one by\ngfs.bern, had signaled that outcome as probable.  The proposal gives shareholders an annual ballot on\nmanagers\u2019 pay. It eliminates sign-on bonuses, as well as\nseverance packages and extra incentives for completing merger\ntransactions. The initiative also includes rules punishing\nexecutives who violate the terms with as long as three years in\njail.  \u201cI\u2019m glad the long battle is over,\u201d Minder, who started\nthe campaign in 2006, told Swiss television. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful\nsign, this proportion above 60 percent.\u201d  At least five of  Europe \u2019s 20 highest-paid chief executive\nofficers work for Swiss companies, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. Among them are the Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Brady Dougan,  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) \u2019s Joe Hogan and Joe Jimenez of  Novartis AG. (NOVN) \n Roche Holding AG (ROG) \u2019s chief Severin Schwan and  Nestle SA (NESN) \u2019s  Paul Bulcke  are also in the top tier.  Vasella Payoff  The initiative got a boost when news broke last month that\nNovartis was planning to pay outgoing chairman Daniel Vasella as\nmuch as $78 million to prevent him from potentially working for\nrival companies. In response to public ire, Europe\u2019s biggest\ndrugmaker scrapped the accord.  Thanks to low taxes and limited bureaucracy, big\ncorporations, including offshore drilling contractor  Transocean\nLtd. (RIG)  and oilfield service company  Weatherford International\nLtd. (WFT) , choose Switzerland as their base.  How much executives take home was called into question in\nSwitzerland after the country\u2019s biggest bank,  UBS AG (UBSN) , had to be\nbailed out during the financial crisis, while in 2010  Credit\nSuisse (CSGN)  CEO Dougan received 71 million francs ($76 million) of\nshares. That compares with a gross average Swiss monthly wage of\n$7,800 for 2011, according to UN  statistics.   \u2018Negative Signal\u2019  The result is a \u201cnegative signal for Switzerland as a\nplace for doing business,\u201d Economiesuisse, a business lobby\nwhich had campaigned against the proposal, said in a statement\ntoday. Nestle CEO Bulcke said on Feb. 15 Minder\u2019s plan would\nmake Switzerland less attractive to corporations and managers.  The Swiss are not alone in their desire to rein in\nexecutive pay in the wake of the financial crisis. Members of\nthe European Parliament last week struck a deal to ban bonuses\nthat are more than twice bankers\u2019 fixed pay if starting Jan. 1,\nif ratified by European Union countries and the full parliament.  The nationality of Switzerland\u2019s top executives -- Dougan,\nHogan and Jimenez are American, while Schwan is Austrian and\nBulcke comes from  Belgium  -- has also fed into the issue, with\nnurses, hotel staff and construction workers complaining they\nface competition from immigrants willing to do their jobs for\nlower pay.  Minder, who blames highly-paid executives for the financial\ncrisis, collected more than 100,000 signatures, triggering\ntoday\u2019s referendum. He says manager payouts highlight the gap\nbetween corporate chiefs and the average wage earner.  Tricky Implementation  In theory, the initiative takes immediate effect, though\nthe government could need time to issue ordinances and adapt\nnational law. There is no set time frame for it to do so. The\n2010 initiative to expel foreigners convicted of serious crimes\nis still before parliament, where politicians disagree about how\nto reconcile it with Switzerland\u2019s obligations under\ninternational law.  In the case of Minder\u2019s proposal, lawmakers also disagree:\nSocial Democrats support the plan while the pro-business Free\nDemocrats oppose it.  \u201cThe concrete implementation of Minder\u2019s initiative should\ntake years,\u201d said Pascal Gentinetta, director of\nEconomiesuisse.
