 "context": "The following article called 'AMD Forecasts Revenue That May Top Some Analysts\u2019 Estimates' was published on 2013-04-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) , the\nNo. 2 maker of personal-computer processors, forecast second-\nquarter sales that may surpass some analysts\u2019 estimates as it\ngenerates more revenue from outside the slumping PC market.  Revenue in the current period will rise 2 percent, plus or\nminus 3 percent, from the first quarter\u2019s $1.09 billion, the\nSunnyvale, California-based company said yesterday in a\nstatement. That indicates a range of $1.08 billion to $1.14\nbillion. Analysts on average had  estimated  sales of $1.07\nbillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Rory Read aims to get 20 percent of\nsales from outside the PC industry by the fourth quarter. Chip\norders for game consoles from Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. may\nbe helping him make progress on that goal and compensating for\nsome of the slowdown in his main businesses, said  Daniel Berenbaum , an analyst at MKM Partners LLC.  \u201cPCs are bad, we know that -- AMD has been losing market\nshare,\u201d Berenbaum said. He has a neutral rating on the\ncompany\u2019s stock. \u201cThe place where there could be upside is on\nconsoles.\u201d  Console Chips  Microsoft will use an AMD processor in its next Xbox game\nmachine, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this\nmonth. That followed an announcement by Sony that the\nPlayStation 4 will also use AMD parts.  AMD is counting on that new business to help it weather\nrecord declines in demand for desktop and laptop computers as\nconsumers defect to smartphones and tablets for getting online.\nGlobal PC shipments fell 14 percent in the three months that\nended in March -- the steepest quarterly drop on record -- as\nMicrosoft\u2019s newest operating system failed to ignite demand, IDC\nsaid last week. That was worse than the 7.7 percent decrease the\nresearcher had forecast.  At the end of 2012, AMD had 15 percent of the market for PC\nprocessors, compared with 85 percent for Intel, according to\nMercury Research.  Before the report, AMD  shares  gained 4.6 percent to $2.51\nat yesterday\u2019s close in New York, rallying in the last half-hour\nof trading from an earlier  decline . The shares traded as high as\n$2.58 and as low as $2.33 after the release.  \u201cIn this environment, with these expectations, it\u2019s a\npretty good report,\u201d said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford\nC. Bernstein & Co. \u201cExpectations were really low.\u201d  First Quarter  For the first quarter, AMD\u2019s net loss narrowed to $146\nmillion, or 19 cents a share, from a loss of $590 million, or 80\ncents, a year earlier. Sales fell 31 percent to $1.09 billion,\nwhile analysts had forecast $1.05 billion.  Sales in AMD\u2019s computer-chip unit fell 9 percent from the\nprior period to $751 million. While server-chip sales at that\nunit were up, following the same trend Intel reported earlier\nthis week, total sales were dragged down by lower shipments of\ndesktop and notebook chips.  AMD\u2019s graphics division recorded a 3 percent increase in\nrevenue from the fourth quarter to $337 million. That unit was\nbolstered by higher royalties for game consoles, AMD said in a\nstatement.  AMD has fired workers and sold assets, seeking to generate\nenough cash to overhaul its product line in an attempt to break\ninto new markets. Some analysts have expressed concern that\ncontinued losses risk diminishing the company\u2019s cash reserves to\nthe point where it might not be able to repay debts.
