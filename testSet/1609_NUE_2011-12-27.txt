The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA surge in U.S. natural-gas\nproduction from shale rock is spurring states to compete for\ncompanies to produce chemicals from the fuel, the Wall Street\nJournal reported.  Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia are vying to attract a\nplant that will turn gas into ethylene proposed by  Royal Dutch\nShell Plc (RDSA) , the Journal reported today. Shell intends to announce\na site early next year, the newspaper said. Ethylene is a\nbuilding block of plastics and other materials used to make\npipes, paint and antifreeze.  Plentiful domestic gas supplies have depressed prices,\nattracting chemical, fertilizer and steel manufacturers to\nconstruct new U.S. plants and reopen shuttered mills in what was\na high-priced market a few years ago, the newspaper said.  West Virginia\u2019s legislature passed a bill this month\nestablishing regulations for drilling into shale formations, a\nprocess known as hydraulic fracturing that involves pumping\nhigh-pressure water, sand and chemicals into the ground to\nshatter rocks and allow gas to flow, the Journal said, citing\nKeith Burdette, the state\u2019s commerce secretary. The legislation\nshould dispel any uncertainty about  West Virginia \u2019s ability to\nprovide a \u201creliable supply\u201d of gas, the paper quoted Burdette\nas saying.  Nucor Corp. (NUE)  is spending $750 million to build a steel mill\nin Louisiana, an investment that wouldn\u2019t have been feasible\nwithout the plunge in gas prices, the newspaper said, citing\nNucor Chief Executive Officer Dan DiMicco.  CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF) , which makes fertilizer from\ngas-derived ingredients, plans to spend $1 billion to $1.5\nbillion over several years to expand its North American plants,\nthe newspaper said. Low gas prices also have reduced electricity\ncosts in some regions where generators burn gas, prompting\n Brazil \u2019s Santana Textiles to build a $180 million denim plant in\nEdinburg, Texas, the Journal said.
