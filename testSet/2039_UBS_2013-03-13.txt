The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEverybody knows the danger of sending things inadvertently in an e-mail. Beda Singenberger\u2019s case shows you also have to be pretty careful when you mail things the old-fashioned way.  Over an 11-year period, federal prosecutors charge, Swiss financial adviser Singenberger helped 60 people in the U.S. hide $184 million in secret offshore accounts bearing colorful names like Real Cool Investments Ltd. and Wanderlust Foundation.  Then, according to a prosecutor, Singenberger inadvertently mailed a list of his U.S. clients, including their names and incriminating details, which somehow wound up in the hands of federal authorities.  Whoops!  Now, U.S. authorities appear to be picking off the clients on that list one by one. Singenberger\u2019s goof has already ensnared Jacques Wajsfelner, an 83-year-old exile from  Nazi Germany , and Michael Canale, a retired U.S. Army surgeon, court records show. Another customer, cancer researcher Michael Reiss, pleaded guilty, though his court records don\u2019t mention the list.  \u201cHe was sending mail to someone in the  United States , and apparently in error he included a list of U.S. taxpayers,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Levy said on March 5 at the sentencing in New York of Wajsfelner. \u201cThe government has mined that list to great effect and prosecuted a number of people who were on that list.\u201d  Wajsfelner, who pleaded guilty to hiding $5.7 million from the  Internal Revenue Service , was sentenced to three months of house arrest.  \u2018Extraordinarily Difficult\u2019  \u201cPeople who hide money in  Switzerland  are extraordinarily difficult for  law enforcement  to identify,\u201d Levy told the judge. Singenberger\u2019s mailing error was \u201cthe only reason\u201d the U.S. was able to identify and prosecute his clients, Levy said.  Aside from Singenberger\u2019s snail-mail gaffe, the case shows how offshore accounts are used not just by the megarich but also by the merely wealthy. It\u2019s also further evidence that the government is continuing its aggressive assault on taxpayers who use offshore accounts to avoid taxes.  Since 2008, U.S. prosecutors charged at least 86 people in their crackdown on offshore  tax evasion , including two dozen bankers, lawyers and advisers like Singenberger. Another 38,000 Americans avoided prosecution through an IRS amnesty program that let them repatriate their accounts by paying back taxes and penalties and disclosing their offshore accounts and bankers.  Bank Secrecy  The major crack in Swiss bank secrecy opened in February 2009, when prosecutors charged  UBS AG (UBSN)  with conspiring to cheat the IRS. UBS, the largest Swiss bank, avoided prosecution by paying $780 million, admitting it fostered tax evasion and handing over data on thousands of clients.  Singenberger, who lives in Zurich, was charged in New York federal court in July 2011 with conspiracy to cheat the IRS.  He ran Zurich-based Sinco Treuhand AG, a  wealth management  and tax-advisory business. Like other offshore bankers charged by the Justice Department, Singenberger is accused of managing, opening and transferring accounts for his U.S. clients. He visited his clients in the U.S., delivering cash from their undeclared accounts or taking cash back to deposit in Switzerland, court records show.  One New York client who banked with UBS for a half-century once had a $74 million account, while a California client of UBS had a $47 million account, prosecutors said.  Bank Promises  Most Swiss banks promised the IRS in 2001 that they would obtain documents on the real owners of accounts and would withhold taxes on some transactions. The  Justice Department  has charged advisers like Singenberger with defeating the purpose of that agreement by hiding the true identities of account owners.  Singenberger created sham foundations in Liechtenstein and phony corporations in  Hong Kong  and the British Virgin Islands to help clients hide their ownership of the accounts, prosecutors charged. The accounts had names like Lucky Overseas Ventures Ltd. and Ample Lion Ltd.  Prosecutors said Singenberger prepared one set of IRS forms for the banks that falsely said the foundations or corporations were the real owners and another set of forms required by Swiss law that truthfully said his clients were the actual owners.  After the UBS investigation became public in 2008, he helped clients move accounts to other Swiss banks to keep them under wraps, prosecutors said. Those banks included Wegelin & Co., the oldest Swiss private bank.  Wegelin Guilty  Wegelin pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court in January to conspiring to help hide more than $1.2 billion in assets from the IRS, while opening undeclared accounts for at least 70 U.S. taxpayers who were former UBS clients. The bank, which paid $74 million to resolve the investigation, closed its doors after 272 years.  Some of Singenberger\u2019s actions are described in the U.S. indictment of Hans Thomann, a UBS client adviser from 1993 to 2003, who later worked for Swiss asset-management firms. Thomann travelled often to  New York  to deliver cash to or accept cash from one client, according to his indictment.  At one meeting, Thomann recommended that a client meet Singenberger.  \u201cA few moments later, Singenberger appeared at the room in which Thomann was staying at the Manhattan hotel,\u201d according to the indictment. Thomann said he and his UBS colleagues \u201crecommended to U.S. taxpayers who had undeclared accounts at UBS that they use the services of Singenberger.\u201d  Second Account  The client later flew to Zurich, where Singenberger set up a second UBS account under the name of a British Virgin Islands corporation, according to the indictment.  Thomann was charged with conspiracy in March 2012 in federal court in New York. He hasn\u2019t answered the charge in court. He couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.  Both Thomann and Singenberger helped Canale, the retired Army surgeon, according to Canale\u2019s charging document, known as a criminal information.  Thomann had handled the account of a relative who died in 2000, leaving the money to Canale. Thomann introduced Canale to Singenberger to set up a structure that \u201cwould, to the greatest extent possible, obscure from the IRS\u201d his ownership of his undeclared account, according to the information.  Singenberger set up a Liechtenstein foundation for Canale, and helped him open an account at Wegelin, prosecutors said. By 2009, the account had grown to $1.5 million.  Bronze Star  Canale, 62, is a Bronze Star recipient who worked for the Army as a field surgeon during Desert Storm in  Saudi Arabia , Iraq and  Kuwait , according to one of his lawyers, Martin Press. He also was a surgeon in Macedonia and  Kosovo , Press said.  It is not clear from court records how Singenberger\u2019s wayward mail enclosure -- which included such client details as their residences, their Swiss banks, and the ways they hid accounts from the IRS -- found its way to prosecutors.  Canale, who pleaded guilty Dec. 21 in New York, was surprised to learn of the existence of the Singenberger list, said his other attorney,  Robert Fink .  Wajsfelner only learned at his March 5 sentencing that he came to the government\u2019s attention through the misdirected list, according to his lawyer, Jeffrey Denner.  \u201cThat was definitely news to me and my client,\u201d he said. \u201cBeda Singenberger, to my understanding, is a figure who\u2019s certainly put a lot of people in the frying pan. I don\u2019t think a lot of people recognized they were so close to the fire.\u201d  Ellen Davis , a spokeswoman for Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in New York, declined to comment.  Accidental Evidence  Nothing prevents the government from using evidence that it obtains accidentally, said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor who worked on the UBS case.  \u201cIt proves that no matter how hard clients try to conceal assets overseas, darn human error can always get in the way,\u201d he said.  Canale, who was also a paratrooper, worked for the Veteran\u2019s Administration from 2010 until retiring last year, Press said.  \u201cIt\u2019s very sad,\u201d said Fink. \u201cIt was an account that he inherited. He never wanted to do anything with it. It\u2019s the most sympathetic case I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s a disaster based on a misfortune that he did not deserve. If anyone deserve leniency, he does.\u201d  Canale pleaded guilty to failing to declare his account on tax returns, and failing to file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts with the Treasury Department. He will be sentenced in federal court in New York next month, Press said.  Singenberger has not made an appearance in U.S. court and didn\u2019t respond to a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment.
