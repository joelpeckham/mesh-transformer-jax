 "context": "The following article called 'Gross to Gundlach Lead Bond Investors Seeing QE3 From Fed' was published on 2012-04-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBill Gross ,  Jeffrey Gundlach  and\n Dan Fuss , whose firms collectively oversee about $1.5 trillion,\nexpect the  Federal Reserve  to conduct a third round of bond\npurchases as signs of strength in the U.S. economy fade and\nEurope\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis returns.  The managers at Pacific Investment Management Co. and\nDoubleLine Capital LP favor mortgage debt as Loomis Sayles & Co.\npurchases corporate bonds. Speculation that the  Fed (FARBAST)  will buy\nhome-loan debt with quantitative easing has led 2012 returns on\ngovernment-backed mortgage bonds to exceed Treasuries by 0.96\npercentage point, Barclays Plc index data show.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen \nand New York Fed President William C. Dudley signaled further\neasing may be needed if growth lags behind projections, with\nheadwinds ranging from the end of tax breaks to $1 trillion of\nmandatory federal budget cuts to $100-a-barrel oil eating into\n consumer spending . The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 has fallen as much\nas 4.8 percent from an almost four-year high on April 2.  \u201cShould the stock market keep going down, it will be a\nportent of weaker economic data,\u201d said Gundlach, whose $22.8\nbillion  DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund (DBLTX)  outperformed 99\npercent of peers last year. \u201cIt will happen and when it does\nyou will start to hear about more support programs.\u201d  Gross, Fuss  While gross domestic product grew at a 3 percent pace in\nthe last three months of 2011, it will slow to 2.3 percent this\nyear, according to the median estimate of 90 economists surveyed\nby Bloomberg.  Gross, the manager of the world\u2019s biggest bond fund,\nboosted holdings of mortgages last month to the most in almost\nthree years. Fuss, a member of the Fixed Income Analysts Society\nHall of Fame, said this week that the Fed may stick with\nquantitative easing until after the presidential election or the\n unemployment rate  falls to about 6 percent from its current 8.2\npercent.  Elsewhere in credit markets, strategists at  JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. (JPM)  lowered their recommendation on U.S. investment-grade\ncorporate bonds to neutral from overweight, saying that\nuncertainty about Europe\u2019s fiscal crisis will limit returns for\nthe debt.  JPMorgan\u2019s  Eric Beinstein , head of the New York-based\nbank\u2019s top-rated high-grade strategy team, said in a report\ntoday that the extra yield the bonds pay more than similar-\nmaturity Treasuries is unlikely to tighten much in the next few\nmonths as the European situation weighs on investor demand.  Default Swaps Rise  \u201cWe believe renewed uncertainty in peripheral Europe will\nlimit the ability of spreads to tighten meaningfully over the\nnext couple of months,\u201d Beinstein wrote in the report. That\nwill counter expected positive developments in the Chinese and\nU.S. economies, he wrote.  A benchmark gauge of corporate credit risk in the U.S. rose\nfor the first time in three days, with the Markit CDX North\nAmerica Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge\nagainst losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increasing 3\nbasis points to a mid-price of 99.8 basis points as of 11:53\na.m. in  New York , according to Markit Group Ltd.  The index rises as investor confidence deteriorates and\nfalls as it improves. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face\nvalue if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the\nvalue of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000\nannually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Bonds of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are the most actively\ntraded U.S. corporate securities by dealers today, with 47\ntrades of $1 million or more as of 11:55 a.m. in New York,\naccording to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Mortgage Bonds  The mortgage-bond market is showing investors anticipate\nmore stimulus from the Fed. Yields on Fannie Mae\u2019s current-\ncoupon 30-year mortgage bonds ended yesterday at 88 basis points\nmore than 10-year Treasuries, down from about 100 basis points\non Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The type of\nsecurities, which most affect home-loan rates because they trade\nclosest to face value, may be targeted by the Fed.  Primary dealers agree with investors, with 15 of the 21\nfirms that trade with the Fed saying odds are that the central\nbank will need a third round of bond purchases to bolster the\neconomy, according to a Bloomberg News survey published April 2.  In its first two rounds of stimulus in response to the\ncredit crisis, the Fed bought $2.3 trillion of bonds from\nDecember 2008 to June to avert deflation and spur growth. It\u2019s\nnow replacing $400 billion of shorter-term maturity Treasuries\nin its holdings with longer-term debt in a policy traders call\nOperation Twist.  Policy Makers Meet  Central bankers next meet in two weeks to debate policy for\nan economy that Dudley and Yellen said may be softening.\nProjections for GDP growth this year are slower than the 3.1\npercent posted in 2005 and 2.7 percent in 2006 before the\nrecession and financial crisis.  Fed officials called for additional stimulus only \u201cif the\neconomy lost momentum\u201d or if inflation stays below their 2\npercent inflation target, according to minutes of their March 13\nmeeting released April 3.  \u201cConsiderable uncertainty surrounds the outlook,\u201d Yellen\nsaid April 11 in a speech in New York. \u201cI consider a highly\naccommodative policy stance to be appropriate in present\ncircumstances.\u201d  \u2018Still Too Soon\u2019  Dudley, in a speech yesterday to business leaders in\nSyracuse, New York, said \u201cit is still too soon to conclude that\nwe are out of the woods.\u201d  Europe \u2019s fiscal imbalances are again threatening to infect\nthe global financial system, with yields on Spanish 10-year\nbonds topping 6 percent this week, approaching the 7 percent\nlevel that prompted Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek\nbailouts.  \u201cThe problems in Europe are getting bigger,\u201d Mohamed El- Erian, co-chief investment officer of Pimco, said April 11 on\nBloomberg Radio. \u201cEurope has a debt issue and Europe has a\ngrowth issue, and until Europe deals with both, we are going to\nhave these reoccurring periods of nervousness in the market.\u201d  Tax reductions enacted by former President  George W. Bush \nare scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 and $1 trillion in\nautomatic cuts in  government spending  will begin in January.\nCrude  oil prices  have soared to $103.67 a barrel, from last\nyear\u2019s low of $75.67 on Oct. 4.  It\u2019s \u201cfar too early to declare victory,\u201d Bernanke said in\na March 27 interview with ABC News.  Hawkish Tone  Some Fed policy makers have struck a more hawkish tone.\nAtlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, a voting member of the\nFederal Open Market Committee this year, said in an April 3\ninterview on Bloomberg Radio that he would need to see some\n\u201cpretty severe circumstances\u201d before he would endorse more\nquantitative easing.  \u201cWith an improving economy, the argument for extraordinary\nmeasures frankly becomes less tenable,\u201d said Kenneth Taubes,\nchief investment officer in  Boston  for Pioneer Investment\nManagement Inc., which oversees almost $30 billion in bonds.  Pimco\u2019s Gross raised the $252.4 billion  Total Return Fund (PTTRX) \u2019s\nholdings of mortgage bonds to 53 percent of assets in March, the\nhighest since June 2009, from 52 percent in February, according\nto a report on the company\u2019s  website  on April 11. He reduced the\nproportion of U.S. government and Treasury debt to 32 percent\nlast month from 37 percent in February.  Operation Twist  The Fed will probably shift focus to buying mortgage\nsecurities to keep borrowing rates low when its Operation Twist\nprogram ends in June, Gross said in a March 28 interview on\nBloomberg Television.  \u201cWithout QE, the financial markets and then the economy\nwill falter,\u201d Gross said in a Twitter post April 4. In a post\nyesterday, he wrote that speeches this week by Yellen and Dudley\ndamped the probabilities of QE3.  Gundlach said softer economic numbers would push the Fed to\nact.  \u201cI just don\u2019t think that we have a healthy fundamental\nfoundation for the economy and therefore surprises are likely to\nbe on the negative side,\u201d Gundlach said in a telephone\ninterview from  Los Angeles . His fund, which invests in\nmortgages, had 34 percent of its money in non-agency residential\nmortgage-backed securities as of March 31, according to the\nDoubleLine website.  Fuss\u2019s $21 billion Loomis Sayles Bond Fund favors corporate\nbonds, according to Matthew Eagan, one of the portfolio\nmanagers. \u201cWe like them in a scenario in which the U.S. economy\nmuddles through,\u201d Eagan said in a telephone interview. Europe\u2019s\ndebt crisis is another issue that may tilt the Fed toward more\neasing.  \u201cBernanke, Yellen and Dudley are all biased towards\nadditional easing,\u201d Robert Michele, global chief investment\nofficer for fixed income and currency at JPMorgan Asset\nManagement, said in a telephone interview from New York.  Michele, who oversees $125 billion in fixed-income assets,\npredicted the central bank would come back with more easing \u201cas\nwe get into summer and fall\u201d in the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:\n Charles Stein  in Boston at \n cstein4@bloomberg.net ;\nAlexis Leondis in New York at \n aleondis@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAlan Goldstein at \n agoldstein5@bloomberg.net ;\nChristian Baumgaertel at \n cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 34.305152893066406 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
