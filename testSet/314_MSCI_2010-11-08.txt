IOI Corp. , Malaysia\u2019s second-biggest palm oil producer, led\ngains in Malaysia\u2019s stock index today, buoyed by a rally in palm\noil.

The target is 30\npercent above the measure\u2019s 1,155.94 close on Nov. 5.  The  MSCI gauge  has surged 17 percent this year, twice the\n8.1 percent gain in the MSCI World Index of shares in developed\nmarkets.

Six Weeks  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index  has climbed for six\nstraight weeks, the longest winning streak since April 2009.\nForeign funds bought $129 million of  Malaysian shares  in\nSeptember, after outflows of $112.4 million in August, CIMB\nInvestment Bank Bhd. analyst  Terence Wong  said on Oct. 27,\nciting EPFR, which collects data from more than 600 funds.  Overseas investment has helped boost the Malaysian ringgit\nby 11 percent against the dollar this year, the second-best\nperformance in Asia excluding Japan.  Malaysia is \u201cunreasonably overlooked,\u201d Sean Darby, an\nanalyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in a report today.\n\u201cMalaysian equities are entering a sweet spot as terms of trade\nturn positive on firming commodity prices and excess liquidity\nmoves into financial assets.\u201d  Darby, who turned \u201cbullish\u201d on Malaysian equities on Jan.\n4 and recommended a switch from Indonesia to Malaysia on May 25,\nsaid he was retaining his recommendation.

Najib\u2019s Plan  Malaysian Prime Minister  Najib Razak  said in an Oct. 15\nbudget speech that the government plans a 100-floor tower and a\nmass rail project to boost spending and spur growth. These are\npart of the $444 billion of private-led projects that the\ngovernment has identified to spur investment and transform the\ncountry into a high-income nation.  Malaysian stocks rose after Najib\u2019s ruling coalition won\ntwo by-elections on Nov. 4 as promises of reforms helped to gain\nvoters\u2019 support. The victories fanned speculation that a general\nelection will be called by the first half of 2011, Vincent Khoo,\nan analyst at UOB Kay Hian Group, said in a note today. The\nelection must be held by 2013.  This is \u201csending the market higher,\u201d he said.  Najib has sought to regain support among ethnic Chinese and\nIndian voters after his National Front coalition was denied a\ntwo-thirds majority in the March 2008 general election.  Surging Inflows  Malaysia\u2019s stock market has also benefited from surging\ninflows of global funds into emerging markets, which have\nbolstered the stock indexes in neighboring Southeast Asian\nnations.
