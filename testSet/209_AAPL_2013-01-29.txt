(JCP)  soared the most in\nmore than a year after the department-store company said it will\nresume holiday-related promotions in another adjustment to Chief\nExecutive Officer  Ron Johnson \u2019s pricing strategy.  The shares rose 9.3 percent to $21.01 at the close in New\nYork, the biggest gain since Jan. 26, 2012. The stock declined\n44 percent last year, compared with a 13 percent gain for the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  Johnson,  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s former retail chief, has eased up on\nhis everyday low pricing model after the company\u2019s revenue fell\nat least 20 percent for the past three quarters. J.C. Penney\nwill hold sales on popular items tied to \u201ckey events and\nholidays\u201d such as Valentine\u2019s Day, Easter and Mother\u2019s Day,\nKate Coultas, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. There\nwill be fewer than 100 of the events, compared with almost 600\nunique promotions in 2011, she said.  Investors betting on a drop in the stock \u201cmay be worried\nthat some sort of return to the sale strategy may generate an\nimprovement in sales trends,\u201d  Liz Dunn , a New York-based\nanalyst at Macquarie Group who rates the shares neutral, the\nequivalent of a hold, said in a telephone interview.  Investors are placing record bets on a decline in J.C.\nPenney\u2019s stock. Almost 25 percent of the company\u2019s shares\noutstanding were sold short this week, the fourth-most in the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index and close to the high of 26 percent\nreached in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and\nMarkit, a London-based research firm. Short-sellers bet that a\nstock will decline in value, usually by selling shares they\nborrow, then buying them back at a lower price.  Suggested Prices  J.C. Penney said during its November earnings call that it\nwill add suggested retail prices to merchandise so customers can\nsee how much they\u2019re saving and will match discounts on national\nbrands such as Jockey when they are running sales.  The company has been sending e-mails to customers alerting\nthem to clearance merchandise and has worked to win back\nshoppers through offers such as a $10 in-store coupon, 30\npercent discounts off clearance items, free children\u2019s haircuts\nand free family portraits.  \u201cWe continue to believe in the importance of great\neveryday value,\u201d Coultas said in the e-mail. \u201cIt has been and\nwill continue to be the cornerstone of our pricing strategy.\nEvery time a customer walks into our store, they can take\nadvantage of low everyday prices.\u201d  J.C. Penney is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings\non Feb. 27. Sales may decline by 24 percent to $4.13 billion,\nthe average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
