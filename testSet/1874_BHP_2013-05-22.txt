 "context": "The following article called 'Barrick Weighs Shrinking to Add Profits: Corporate Canada' was published on 2013-05-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMay 22 (Bloomberg News) --  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the biggest\nminer of the metal by sales, is considering shrinking in size as\nthe company focuses on returns over production volumes, Chief\nExecutive Officer Jamie Sokalsky said.  \u201cBeing more profitable is better than being bigger,\u201d\nSokalsky said yesterday at the Bloomberg  Canada  Economic Summit\nin Toronto. \u201cIf we divested of some of those smaller, higher-cost assets and came down to a suite of assets that are long-lived and lower-cost and more valuable, I think that ultimately\nthat can be a better investment proposition.\u201d  Gold producers are trading at their  cheapest  in more than a\ndecade relative to the broader market, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg, as investors flee the industry amid\nrising mining costs, project delays and asset writedowns.\nSokalsky, who took over as CEO of the Toronto-based company 11\nmonths ago, is reviewing growth plans and pursuing asset sales\nas gold trades at a two-year low and is poised to end a rally\nthat has extended for 12 straight years.  Barrick, the owner or part owner of 27 mines, rose 2.1\npercent to C$20.29 at 9:43 a.m. in Toronto. The company closed\nat a two-decade low on April 17, losing its position as the top\ngold miner by market value to Vancouver-based  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  last\nmonth.  Possible Sale  It makes sense for Barrick to shrink, said  George Topping ,\nan analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Toronto. Selling the\ncompany\u2019s Australian assets would be \u201ca good place to start,\u201d\nhe said. Barrick is working with Bank of America Corp. and UBS\nAG on a possible sale of Australian mines, two people with\nknowledge of the matter said last month.  \u201cAt the 8 million-ounce level, with 26 or so mines it\u2019s\nvery difficult to focus,\u201d Topping said yesterday by phone. \u201cIn\norder to have better managerial control you\u2019re better off with\nfewer but much larger assets, preferably in the same north-south\ntime zones.\u201d  It\u2019s easier to manage a company with fewer assets, said\nSokalsky, 55. The location of mines also has taken on a greater\nimportance because of an increase in so-called resource\nnationalism, in which governments seek a bigger slice of\nrevenue. After a dispute with the  Dominican Republic , Toronto-based Barrick on May 8 agreed to amend a lease governing the\nPueblo Viejo mine in the country.  Political Risk  Investors including hedge-fund billionaire  John Paulson \nhave also pushed for some gold producers to consider separating\nassets that are located in riskier locations. Johannesburg-based\n Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  in February spun off most of its assets in\n South Africa , which has been beset by labor disputes and seen a\npolitical debate about nationalizing mines.  \u201cFive to 10 years ago a mine in  Papua New Guinea  might get\nthe same valuation as a mine in Canada in the market place, and\nI think that\u2019s changed considerably,\u201d Sokalsky said.\n\u201cDifferentiating the portfolio from a geopolitical standpoint\ncan also change the dynamic of how valuable your assets are.\u201d  Barrick said in February it\u2019s seeking buyers for its energy\nunit and a 50 percent stake in the Kabanga nickel project in\nTanzania. It\u2019s \u201cactively\u201d looking at selling other assets,\nSokalsky said yesterday, declining to name them. Barrick won\u2019t\nresort to a \u201cfire sale,\u201d he said.  Sokalsky said it\u2019s harder to sell assets now than it would\nhave been a couple of years ago because of lower metal prices\nand equity valuations. The general mood in the gold industry is\n\u201canti-M&A,\u201d  he said.  Gold Rebound?  Mining companies led by  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world\u2019s\nlargest, are holding the biggest-ever sale of assets this year\nas producers seek to boost earnings and cut costs, with about\n$48 billion of mines and assets on the block.  Gold futures for June delivery rose 0.8 percent to\n$1,388.60 an ounce at 9:42 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . The\nmetal has tumbled 17 percent this year and slumped into a  bear\nmarket  last month.  Still, Sokalsky said he doesn\u2019t believe the long-term  bull\nmarket  for gold has ended and expects the price will eventually\nrise to a record. Central bank purchases of gold, high\ngovernment debt levels and a lack of new supply will support\nprices for the metal, he said. A rally back to $1,700 to $1,800\nan ounce in the next 12 months is probably \u201cachievable,\u201d he\nsaid.  Sokalsky, who was previously Barrick\u2019s chief financial\nofficer, was promoted to CEO on June 6 to replace Aaron Regent,\nwho was fired after the board said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by\nthe company\u2019s share-price performance.  Equities Opportunity  Despite Sokalsky\u2019s efforts to cut operating costs, sell\nunderperforming assets and resolve the problems dogging its $8.5\nbillion Pascua-Lama project in the Andes, Barrick\u2019s shares have\ncontinued to slide, along with those of its peers. Barrick has\nfallen 42 percent this year while the Philadelphia Stock\nExchange Gold and Silver Index has dropped 38 percent.  The 30 companies in the Philadelphia index  trade  at 1.04\ntimes book value, compared with a 2.48 multiple for the Standard\n& Poor\u2019s 500 Index. The average ratio for the Philadelphia index\nin the past 10 years is 2.45, according to  data  compiled by\nBloomberg.  There\u2019s an opportunity for gold equities to outperform the\nmetal, after two years of trailing gold, Sokalsky said.  \u201cGiven the valuations where they are now and the fact that\nthe gold price has come down but the share prices have come down\neven more, I do think that there is a good opportunity for some\nof that money to come back into the gold equities,\u201d he said.  Pascua-Lama  Barrick hopes to have more clarity within a few months on\nthe future of Pascua-Lama, which lies on the Chile-Argentina\nborder, Sokalsky said. The company said April 24 it was\nconsidering options including suspending the project after\nconstruction on the Chilean side was halted because a court\naccepted an injunction filed by indigenous communities concerned\nabout water supplies.  Barrick raised the cost estimate for the project twice last\nyear and said output would be delayed by more than a year, until\nthe second half of 2014. The company, which has invested almost\n$5 billion in Pascua-Lama, made mistakes at the project,\nincluding how it managed environmental controls, Sokalsky said.  \u201cIt\u2019s an important project for us, but we need the further\nclarity before we actually spend significant amounts more\nmoney,\u201d he said.
