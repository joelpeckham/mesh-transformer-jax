 "context": "The following article called 'AOL, Genzyme, NASA, Lin, Righthaven: Intellectual Property' was published on 2012-03-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAOL Inc. (AOL)  hired  Evercore Partners\nInc. (EVR)  to find a buyer for its more than 800 patents and explore\nother strategic options, three people with knowledge of the\nmatter said.  Private-equity firms, including Providence Equity Partners\nInc., TPG Capital and  Silver Lake (SLR) , have approached AOL about\ntaking the company private, yet those overtures haven\u2019t resulted\nin a deal, said the people, who asked not to be identified\nbecause the matter hasn\u2019t been disclosed.  Evercore is trying to help the company wring value from a\npatent portfolio that AOL shareholder Starboard Value LP said\nmay yield more than $1 billion in licensing income. AOL has\nexplored options as an alternative to remaining public amid\nmounting subscriber losses and a slump that has sliced revenue\n29 percent since the 2009 spinoff from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)   AOL\u2019s share price has climbed 74 percent since Aug. 10,\nwhen it fell to its lowest level since the spinoff, amid\nspeculation it might be sold to a private-equity firm. It has\nbecome too expensive for the financing of a leveraged buyout,\npeople said.  Private equity firms are often drawn by a company\u2019s ability\nto generate cash. AOL\u2019s appeal is diminishing as its dial-up\nbusiness dries up, the people said. Sales in that division have\nplunged each of the past four quarters.  Maureen Sullivan , a spokeswoman for AOL, declined to\ncomment. Representatives of Evercore and the private-equity\nfirms declined to comment.  AOL\u2019s portfolio includes \u201csome of the foundation patents\nfor the Internet,\u201d AOL Chief Executive Officer  Tim Armstrong \nsaid at a Barclays Capital conference this month.  \u201cIt\u2019s beachfront property in East Hampton,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically extremely valuable.\u201d  Armstrong said in a December interview that he was open to\ngoing private. It \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d whether AOL remains public\nor goes private, he said. Remaining an independent entity is the\n\u201cfirst desired course of action,\u201d he said.  Genzyme Patent for Kidney Disease Drug Hectorol Ruled Valid  Genzyme Corp. (GENZ)  and  Bone Care International Inc. (BCII)  won a U.S.\njudge\u2019s ruling that their patent for the kidney disease drug\nHectorol is valid and enforceable.  U.S. District Judge Robert M. Dow affirmed the patent\u2019s\nvalidity in a 78-page ruling published March 22. The companies,\nnow part of Paris-based  Sanofi (SAN) , filed suit seeking that ruling\nin 2008 to prevent U.S.-based drugmakers Pentech Pharmaceuticals\nInc. and its Cobrek Pharmaceuticals Inc. unit from making a\ncompeting generic version.  The case was tried before Dow in Chicago in October and\nNovember 2010.  An injectable drug, Hectorol is used to treat patients with\nend-stage kidney disease who are undergoing dialysis and\nsuffering from hyperactivity in that part of the thyroid gland\nthat regulates calcium and phosphorus levels.  Closely-held Pentech and Cobrek are based in the Chicago\nsuburb of Rolling Meadows,  Illinois . Citing their non-public\nstatus, an employee of the company who declined identify herself\nsaid the businesses declined to comment on Dow\u2019s ruling.  The case is Bone Care International Inc. v. Pentech\nPharmaceuticals Inc., 08cv1083, U.S. District Court for the\nNorthern District of Illinois ( Chicago ).

Trademark  Skydive Arizona Infringement Verdict Stands, Damages Award Cut  Skydive Arizona Inc. \u2019s trademark-infringement judgment\nagainst a Georgia-based competitor was affirmed by a federal\nappeals court, which cut part of the damages award.  The Eloy, Arizona-based company sued Cary Quattrocchi and\nhis Atlanta Skydiving Center in federal court in Phoenix in\nAugust 2005. Quattrocchi also did business as 1-800-Skyride.\nSkydive  Arizona  claimed the Georgia company was infringing\nSkydive Arizona\u2019s trademarks, deliberately misleading the\npublic, and falsely claimed to be doing business in Arizona.  The jury agreed with Skydive Arizona\u2019s claim and awarded\n$7.6 million. The trial judge then increased that amount to\nalmost $10 million. Quattrocchi\u2019s appeal argued the trial court\nerred in upholding the jury\u2019s damages award, and overreached by\nincreasing it.  The appeals court said that the Arizona company presented\nadequate evidence of the damages it incurred, \u201cproving that\ncustomers were very angry with and blamed Skydive Arizona for\nproblems called by Skyride.\u201d  While it was true that counsel for Skydive \u201casked the jury\nto \u2018fill in\u201d the amount of damages it found reasonable,\u201d this\nwasn\u2019t \u201can invitation for the jury to conjure the amount of\ndamages out of the vapor,\u201d the appeals court said.  Quattrocchi and his Skyride had also objected to the $2.5\nmillion in lost profit the trial court awarded Skydive. The\nappeals court said Skyride \u201cfailed to assert any basis for\nchallenging the lost profits award based on the record as it\nexists.\u201d  The appeals court did overturn the trial court\u2019s doubling\nof the damages, saying the ruling \u201crevealed its punitive\nmotivation.\u201d While federal trademark law permits compensation,\nit \u201chas been construed to expressly forbid the award of damages\nto punish an infringer,\u201d the appeals court said.  Skydive\u2019s case was argued in the appellate court by Sid\nLeach of  Snell & Wilmer LLP (1364L)  of Phoenix. Quattrocchi\u2019s case was\nargued by  Daniel H. Bromberg  of Los Angeles- based Quinn Emanuel\nUrquhart & Sullivan LLP .  The case at the trial court is Skydive Arizona Inc.  v.\nQuattrocchi, 2:05-cv-2656-DGC, U.S. District Court, District of\nArizona (Phoenix). The appeals court case is Skydive Arizona\nInv. v. Quattrocchi, 10-16196, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals\n( San Francisco ).  Jeremy Lin\u2019s Lawyers Seek to Stop \u2018Linsanity\u2019 Pot Offerings  Lawyers representing New York Nicks star Jeremy Lin sent\ncease-and-desist letters to marijuana dispensaries that have\nbeen selling a \u201cLinsanity\u201d line of product, the Huffington\nPost  reported .  Some of the shops have already complied and removed the\nproduct, Lin\u2019s lawyer,  Pamela Deese  of  Washington \u2019s  Arent Fox\nLLP (1377L) , told the Huffington Post.  She said their enthusiasm for the player \u201cgot ahead of\ntheir understanding of the law,\u201d according to the Huffington\nPost.  Deese also told the Huffington Post that her firm sent\ncease-and-desist letters to the 24 applicants who had tried to\nregister his name as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and\n Trademark Office  and most have said they were sorry and have\nwithdrawn their applications.

Copyright  Cendali Withdraws From Righthaven Cases, Says Legal Fees Unpaid  Stephens Media Group\u2019s efforts to enforce copyrights to its\nnewspapers included hiring a high-profile IP specialist from a\nChicago firm.  The cases, which were filed by Righthaven LLC of Las Vegas,\nset up to enforce Stephens copyrights, have largely come to\nnaught, as judges determined that Righthaven lacked sufficient\ncontrol over the copyrights to be able to enforce them.  According to a May 4 filing, Righthaven hired  Dale Cendali \nfrom  Kirkland & Ellis LLP (1132L)  to help litigate a case against the\nPahrump Life website on which an article from the Las Vegas\nReview-Journal was posted without authorization.  Cendali may be best known for her successful representation\nof Harry Potter\u2019s U.S. publisher  Scholastic Corp. (SCHL)  in a trademark\ncase. She has also represented the  Associated Press  in the\ncopyright-infringement case involving the photo of President\n Barack Obama  used by artist Shepard Fairey.  When she was with Los Angeles-based  O\u2019Melveny & Myers LLP (1227'L) \nshe represented the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance\nin a trademark suit involving the name of the late Martha\nGraham. Cendali moved from O\u2019Melveny to Chicago-based Kirkland &\nEllis in March 2009.  In two March 21 filings, Celdali sought to withdraw as\ncounsel in two cases. She said she had been hired solely in\nconnection with one issue -- whether Righthaven had standing to\nsue for infringement. Righthaven\u2019s lawyers were to handle the\nrest of the case. She said that in July, she was told \u201cthat her\njob was done\u201d and that the rest of the work would be handled by\nothers.  She said that other than an initial retainer, she and her\nfirm hadn\u2019t been paid any of the legal fees Righthaven owed.  Righthaven\u2019s assets, including the copyrights it said it\nwas enforcing, were awarded to a defendant in a different\ninfringement suit March 5. Its Internet domain name sold at\nauction to satisfy an attorney-fee judgment.  Righthaven no longer has an office, phone or e-mail address\nwhere anyone could be asked to comment on Celdali\u2019s filings and\nthe company has failed to appear in court for scheduled events.  One of the cases from which Cendali withdrew is Righthaven\nv. Pahrump Life, 2:10-cv-01575-JCM-PAL, U.S. District Court,\nDistrict of Nevada (Las Vegas). The other case is Righthaven LLC\nv. Democratic Underground LLC, 2:10-cv-01356-RLK-GWF, U.S.\nDistrict Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas).  The case in which the intellectual property was awarded to\nthe defendant is Righthaven LLC v. Hoehn, 2:11-cv-00050-PMP-RJJ,\nU.S. District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas).
