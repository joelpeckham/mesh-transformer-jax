 "context": "The following article called 'Trichet Says Rising Market Rates Don't Reflect ECB Policy' was published on 2010-07-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEuropean Central Bank President  Jean- Claude Trichet  said Europe\u2019s economy is stronger than some\ninvestors think and signaled the bank doesn\u2019t intend to do more\nto fight the sovereign debt crisis for now.  \n \u201cThere is a tendency from the outside to be excessively\npessimistic\u201d about Europe, Trichet said at a press conference\nin Frankfurt after the ECB left its  benchmark rate  at a record\nlow of 1 percent. \u201cThe figures don\u2019t confirm this pessimism.\u201d\nThe euro rose half a cent to an eight-week high of $1.27.  \n \u201cTrichet wanted to spread confidence and show that the\nfinancial and banking sectors aren\u2019t doing too badly,\u201d said\n Carsten Brzeski , an economist at ING Group in Brussels. \u201cHe\u2019s\ntalking down the potential for a double-dip recession in the\neuro area. I agree. We will see a slowdown, but no double dip.\u201d  \n Europe\u2019s debt crisis has pushed up bond yields and forced\ngovernments to cut spending, threatening to derail the economic\nrecovery. The International Monetary Fund said yesterday the ECB\nmay have to step up its bond purchases to convince investors it\nwon\u2019t allow market tensions to escalate. Trichet indicated the\ncentral bank is content with its \u201cprogressively diminishing\u201d\npurchases and has no plans at the moment to extend longer-term\nlending to banks, even as market borrowing costs climb.  \n Market Rates  \n Market rates are rising after banks tapped the ECB for less\nfunds than investors expected before paying back a record 442\nbillion-euro ($559 billion) ECB loan on July 1, reducing excess\nliquidity in the system.  \n It would be a \u201cmistake\u201d to interpret interbank borrowing\ncosts as a monetary-policy signal, Trichet said, adding the\nECB\u2019s key refinancing rate remains \u201cappropriate.\u201d At the same\ntime, rising rates are \u201cthe consequence of the decision of the\nbanks\u201d to borrow less from the ECB, he said.  \n Trichet \u201cconveyed an impression that the ECB was happy not\nto be dictating short rates at present,\u201d said  David Page , an\neconomist at Investec Securities in London. \u201cThis apparent\nabdication of responsibility for short rates could lead to an\neffective premature tightening of monetary policy. One could\nrealistically expect further liquidity withdrawals to raise\novernight rates towards the 1 percent refi rate over the coming\nquarters.\u201d  \n The European Overnight Index Average rate, or  EONIA , jumped\nto 0.542 percent on June 30 from as low as 0.295 percent on June\n3. The rate that banks charge each other to borrow for  three\nmonths  has increased to 0.8 percent, the highest in 10 months,\nfrom 0.63 percent at the end of March.  \n \u2018Much Better\u2019  \n The economy of the 16 nations sharing the euro expanded 0.2\npercent in the first three months of the year and Trichet,\nciting \u201cvery good\u201d recent data, said second-quarter growth\n\u201cis likely to be much better.\u201d  \n Trichet\u2019s optimism about the economy contrasts with the\nview of the IMF, which yesterday cut its forecast for euro-\nregion growth next year to 1.3 percent from 1.5 percent. The\neconomy will expand 1 percent this year, it said.  \n With the recovery still fragile, the Washington-based fund\nsaid the ECB may need to step up bond purchases \u201cto prevent a\nfurther deterioration of market functioning.\u201d  \n The  extra yield  that investors demand to hold Spanish\n10-year bonds over the German equivalents was at 203 basis\npoints today, higher than it was before the ECB started its\npurchase program.  \n \u2018Quite Perky\u2019  \n Trichet said there are signs of improvement on bond markets\nand noted the ECB\u2019s asset purchases, which were not backed by\nall 22 of its policy makers, have been slowing.  \n He welcomed the European Union\u2019s decision to publish the\nresults of bank stress tests, saying transparency is a\n\u201cvirtue.\u201d  \n Where necessary, \u201cbanks should retain earnings, turn to\nthe market to strengthen further their capital bases or take\nfull advantage of government support measures for\nrecapitalization,\u201d he said.  \n \u201cTrichet actually sounded quite perky,\u201d said  Julian Callow , chief European economist at Barclays Capital in London.\n\u201cThe subtext may have been that the ECB has more insight than\nanyone else into the banking sector through its involvement in\nthe stress tests and the interbank market.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Gabi Thesing  in London at \n gthesing@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet speaks during a news conference at the bank's headquarters in Frankfurt.
