 "context": "The following article called 'Euro Rises on German Sentiment; Dollar Drops Before Fed' was published on 2012-12-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe euro strengthened for a second\nday against the dollar after a German report showed investor\nconfidence jumped this month.  The 17-nation currency rose versus all except two of its 16\nmajor counterparts. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  fell the most in a week as\n48 of 49 economists in a Bloomberg News survey expect the\n Federal Reserve  will expand its bond buying program at a two-day\nmeeting starting today. The Swiss franc fell against the euro as\n UBS AG (UBSN)  joined Credit Suisse Group AG in saying it will charge\nbank clients for deposits made in the currency.  \u201cThere is an expectation that the Fed is going to announce\nsome additional easing and there is a general risk-on sentiment\nafter the ZEW survey out of  Germany ,\u201d said  Samarjit Shankar , a\nmanaging director for the foreign-exchange group in  Boston  at\nBank of  New York  Mellon. \u201cInvestors for today are willing to\ngive risk the benefit of the doubt.\u201d  The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.3005 at 5 p.m. New York\ntime, rising to the highest since Dec. 6. The common currency\nappreciated 0.7 percent to 107.32 yen. The dollar gained 0.2\npercent to 82.52 yen.  The  Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback versus the\ncurrencies of six U.S. trading partners, fell 0.3 percent to\n80.057, the biggest drop since Dec. 3.  Franc Weakens  The franc declined 0.4 percent to 1.2126 per euro after\ndepreciating to 1.2168 on Dec. 5, the weakest since Sept. 17.  UBS,  Switzerland \u2019s biggest bank, said it will start\ncharging financial institutional clients for cash balances held\nin francs from Dec. 21. The amounts will be communicated\nindividually to clients within days the bank said, adding that\n\u201cwe encourage our customers to keep their Swiss franc balances\nas low as possible.\u201d  The franc dropped last week as Credit Suisse was said to\nset a negative rate of as much as minus 1 percent on balances\nheld in the currency.  Canada\u2019s dollar declined against most of its major\ncounterparts. The seven-day relative strength index for the\ncurrency rose to 74, its third day above the 70 level which\nsignals an asset\u2019s value may have risen too quickly.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, was little\nchanged against its U.S. peer at 98.61 cents.  Yen Drops  The yen fell against most its major counterparts as global\nequities advanced. The MSCI World Index of stocks rose 0.6\npercent and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index gained 0.7 percent.  Sweden\u2019s krona was the best performing major currency\ntoday, topping the euro. It gained 0.7 percent to 6.6463 per\ndollar and advanced 0.2 percent to 8.6437 per euro.  Spain sold a combined 3.89 billion euros of 12- and 18-\nmonth bills, the central bank said. That compared with its\nmaximum target of 3.5 billion euros. It sold the 12-month\nsecurities at an average yield of 2.556 percent, compared with\n2.797 percent on Nov. 20.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim\nsaid its index of German investor and analyst expectations\nclimbed to 6.9 this month from minus 15.7 in November.\nEconomists forecast a gain to minus 11.5, according to a\nBloomberg News survey.  \u201cA combination of forces, including the ZEW index\u201d are\nboosting the euro, said Audrey Childe-Freeman, head of foreign-\nexchange strategy at  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  in  London . \u201cThere\u2019s a\nbroadly more bearish dollar sentiment on the looming Fed\nmeeting. I believe that it is just a matter of time before we\ntest $1.30 again.\u201d  Month View  The euro has gained 1.1 percent during the past month,\naccording to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track\n10 developed-market currencies. The dollar declined 1.4 percent\nand the yen slid 5.4 percent.  The dollar fell against most of its major peers before the\n Federal Open Market Committee  begins its last meeting for 2012\ntoday. The central bank will increase accommodation by\nannouncing $45 billion in monthly Treasury buying in addition to\nthe existing program of $40 billion a month of mortgage-backed\nsecurities, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. That\nwill push its balance sheet almost to $4 trillion.  \u201cThe market has come to expect Fed dovishness and so\nselling dollars before a Fed meeting has been on everyone\u2019s\nradar,\u201d said  Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at\nBarclays Plc in New York. \u201cThe market is focused what is going\non in the U.S. and fundamentals in  Europe  and certainly in core\nEurope it still looks constructive.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAllison Bennett in New York at \n abennett23@bloomberg.net ;\n David Goodman  in London at \n dgoodman28@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDave Liedtka at \n dliedtka@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was 42.91196823120117 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was ",
