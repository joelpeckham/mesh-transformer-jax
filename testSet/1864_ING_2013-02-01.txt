 "context": "The following article called 'Carney Wait Prompts BOE Inertia Danger in Slump Battle: Economy' was published on 2013-02-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of England officials will probably discuss the threat of a triple-dip recession today and prepare to sit on their hands as a looming change of governor overshadows the remainder of Mervyn King\u2019s term.  With five months before Mark Carney takes over, the Monetary Policy Committee is awaiting results of its credit- boosting program after halting bond purchases and signaling no further interest-rate cuts for now. That backdrop will color today\u2019s \u201cpre-MPC\u201d briefings in  London  as policy makers discuss new forecasts before their Feb. 7 decision.  \u201cThere is that element of \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 about things, and that\u2019s not particularly to the advantage of the economic situation,\u201d said Neil Mackinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital in London and a former U.K. Treasury official. \u201cIt becomes an excuse to wait until the new governor is in place. There is always the danger of policy paralysis.\u201d  Economists predict the MPC will leave its quantitative- easing program and  benchmark rate  unchanged next week. MPC members\u2019 inertia may reflect concerns that QE has lost its impact, while officials have turned their focus to the success of the Funding for Lending Scheme. Policy makers\u2019 remarks are also increasingly addressing the next governorship and a potential revamp of their mandate in a debate sparked by Carney, who will become the first foreigner to run the Bank of England.  \u2018New Idea\u2019  \u201cThe changeover has slowed things down a little,\u201d said Jens Larsen, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets in London and a former Bank of England official. \u201cEveryone is angling around for this great new idea that\u2019s going to solve the problems, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d  In a coincidence of timing that emphasizes the clash of old and new, the Bank of England\u2019s meeting and decision next week will take place just as Carney makes his first public appearance in the U.K. in connection with his new role. He will  testify to lawmakers  who have said they will ask him whether the existing policy framework is the right one for the U.K. after barely any economic growth in the past four years.  The weakness of the economy may loom during both sessions after data last week showed  gross domestic product  fell 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, more than economists had forecast. While the U.S., German and Canadian economies are back above their pre-recession levels, Britain has recovered only half of the output lost during the 2008-2009 recession.  Still, a report today showed  U.K. manufacturing  expanded for a second month in January and output surged the most since September 2011.  James Knightley , an economist at ING Bank NV in London, said this \u201coffers hope\u201d the economy will avoid a recession.  BOE Response  In response to the slump, the Bank of England cut its key rate to a record low in March 2009 and started buying government bonds, accumulating  375 billion pounds  ($594 billion).  The BOE\u2019s latest measure is the FLS, which aims to boost credit. A central bank survey this month indicated mixed results. While  mortgage availability  rose \u201csignificantly\u201d in the fourth quarter, an improvement in corporate lending conditions was more pronounced for large firms than small ones.  King has signaled the BOE is still awaiting the full impact, saying on Jan. 22 that lending conditions should improve further as it \u201ckicks in.\u201d All 43 economists in a  Bloomberg News survey  forecast that QE will be maintained on Feb. 7. The MPC will also keep the key rate at 0.5 percent, according to a separate poll.  Carney Questions  \u201cThe central bank may have exhausted its current QE program, and they\u2019ve moved on to the FLS as a way to break the liquidity trap,\u201d Mackinnon said. \u201cBut they\u2019re up against it. The wait for the transition in monetary policy could create unnecessary uncertainty.\u201d  Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the Treasury Committee, said on Tuesday he will question Carney on whether there may be a \u201cbetter monetary policy for the U.K. than the current one,\u201d under which the BOE aims to keep inflation at 2 percent. That line was prompted by Carney\u2019s comment that nominal gross domestic product targeting could be an even \u201cmore powerful tool\u201d to stimulate economies.  King and BOE policy makers including Ian McCafferty and  Spencer Dale  have also responded. The governor welcomed the debate, saying it\u2019s \u201csensible\u201d to review monetary-policy arrangements. Still, he said his view remains that a long-run 2 percent inflation target \u201cshould be an essential part of our macroeconomic framework.\u201d  Recovery Momentum  As discussions on central bank tools continue, the economy is struggling to build momentum. The government\u2019s austerity program, inflation that\u2019s outpacing wage growth and a recession in the euro area have undermined Britain\u2019s recovery. The MPC will have new forecasts to guide its decision next week that King will publish at a press conference on Feb. 13.  \u201cLooking from where we are at, it seems the MPC are not doing a lot while the economy is flat lining,\u201d said Rob Wood, an economist at Berenberg Bank in London and a former Bank of England official. \u201cMark Carney is talking about quite radical monetary policies -- it does seem to be overshadowing things.\u201d  The global backdrop may be starting to improve. In the euro region, a  factory gauge  rose to 47.9 in January from 46.1 in December. That compares with an initial estimate of 47.5. The index for  Germany , the region\u2019s largest economy, jumped to 49.8 from 46. Italy\u2019s measure also rose, while  France \u2019s declined.  Inflation Slows  Also in the euro area,  inflation  slowed to 2 percent in January from 2.2 percent a month earlier, the European Union\u2019s statistics office said. The jobless rate in the currency bloc was 11.7 percent in December, matching a revised November level.  A manufacturing index for  China  was 50.4 in January compared with 50.6 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said. A separate gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit covering fewer businesses rose to a two-year high of 52.3 from 51.5.  Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded more than forecast in January, with the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s factory index climbing to 53.1 from December\u2019s 50.2.  Another report showed hiring increased in January after accelerating more than previously estimated at the end of 2012. Payrolls rose 157,000 following a revised 196,000 advance in the prior month and a 247,000 surge in November. The jobless rate increased to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent.
