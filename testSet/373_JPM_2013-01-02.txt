 "context": "The following article called 'OCC Says Almost 500,000 Seek Reviews of Foreclosures' was published on 2013-01-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAfter a deadline-inspired surge,\nnearly 500,000 borrowers are seeking formal reviews of their\n2009 and 2010 foreclosures for mistakes by lenders, the U.S.\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency reported.  \u201cA significant amount of effort was made to increase\nawareness during the fourth quarter of 2012, and that\u2019s\nreflected in the increase in the number of people who requested\na review,\u201d said  Bryan Hubbard , an OCC spokesman. The tally of\napplicants spiked from 356,000 on Dec. 13 to 495,000 by the Dec.\n31 deadline, Hubbard said.  Federal regulators are set to replace the existing victim-\nby-victim compensation effort with about $10 billion in flat\npenalties against the banks, according to five people briefed on\nthe talks who asked not to be named because the discussions are\nprivate.  A group of 14 of the largest mortgage servicers including\n JPMorgan Chase & Co., (JPM)   Bank of America Corp.  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) \nwere ordered by the OCC and other banking regulators in 2011 to\nclean up their foreclosure practices and hire independent\nconsultants to see whether they hurt customers unfairly. The\nregulators sent letters to 4.4 million potential claimants\ninviting them to seek reviews.  The 14 firms could be instructed to give lump-sum payments\nof between $500 and $125,000 in each case involving improper\npractices, the agencies said in June. No wronged borrowers have\nbeen paid, Hubbard said.  It\u2019s unclear how much in payouts the existing system would\nhave resulted in, nor what people would receive in the pending\naction. Also unclear is whether the independent consultants\nhired by the lenders will continue to conduct the reviews under\nthe new enforcement action. An announcement of the new action\ncould come as soon as this week, the people said.  Separately, U.S. state attorneys general and federal\nauthorities continue to press regional banks to accept a\nsettlement over mishandled foreclosure documents similar to a\n$25 billion deal reached with larger competitors last year,\naccording to people briefed on the talks.
