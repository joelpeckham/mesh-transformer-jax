 "context": "The following article called 'Global Logistic Seeks China Growth From Amazon: Southeast Asia' was published on 2012-08-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGlobal Logistic Properties Ltd. (GLP) , a\nunit of Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, said its China assets\nwill match those in  Japan  as tenants, including online retailers\n Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and 360buy.com, add more space.  The company invested $1 billion in China last year and\nexpects to expand from that base as it attracts tenants with\nmodern warehouses in the world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy,\nChief Executive Officer Ming Z. Mei said. The net asset value in\nChina will match that in Japan in six to 12 months, he said.  \u201cWe are in the very early stage of the industry so it\u2019s\ngoing to be a long time before we can satisfy the needs of our\ncustomers,\u201d Mei said in an interview in  Singapore  yesterday.\n\u201cEighty percent of China\u2019s logistic facilities are old and\nobsolete so it will be a long time before we can refill all\nthose spaces. We can grow on that $1 billion base.\u201d  The growth in its China  assets  will boost contribution from\na market where earnings jumped fivefold in its fiscal first\nquarter, supplementing a more stable income stream from Japan,\nMei said. The company is also seeking more efficiency in China,\nwhere logistics costs are equivalent to 18 percent of the gross\ndomestic product, twice the level in the U.S., Mei said.  China has 550 million square meters (5.9 billion square\nfeet) of warehouse space, compared with 1.2 billion square\nmeters in the U.S., Mei said.  Three to four of its top 10 clients are from the e-commerce\nindustry, Mei said. These Internet companies represent 16\npercent of the leased area in China and 11 percent in Japan, the\nSingapore-based company said in a presentation this week.  Adidas, Coke  Customers also include consumer goods makers Adidas AG, and\n Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , as well as logistics companies such as Deutsche\nPost AG\u2019s DHL and  Nippon Express Co. (9062) , according to its  website .  The expansion drew investors including China Investment\nCorp., the nation\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. The two agreed in\nDecember to buy 15 Japanese warehouses for 122.6 billion yen\n($1.6 billion) as demand for storage rebounded after the March\n2011 earthquake. The Singapore company formed a joint venture\nwith the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board last year to\ninvest $250 million each over three years in Japan.  Global Logistic  reported  a 57 percent increase in profit to\n$153 million in its fiscal first quarter ended June, it said on\nAug. 14. Earnings from  China  jumped to $56.6 million, it said.  \u201cThere is a lot of potential for a big player like GLP,\nwhich is by far the largest player in China, to take advantage\nof redeveloping old facilities,\u201d said Donald Chua, a Singapore-\nbased analyst at CIMB-GK Pte, who rates the stock the equivalent\nof a hold after a rally. \u201cThese will also form a source of\nacquisition targets. A lot of the local companies are builders\nbut not operators, and GLP has that edge of building and\noperating.\u201d  Stock Rally  Global Logistic increased 0.8 percent to S$2.41 as of 9:31\na.m. in Singapore trading, set for a record. The gain added to\nthe 37 percent advance this year, compared with the 21 percent\ngain in the  Bloomberg Asia Pacific Real Estate Index. (BPRREAL)   The company\u2019s total assets rose 13 percent to $14 billion\nas of June 30, it said this week. The expansion into China\nincluded the purchase of a 53.1 percent stake in Airport City\nDevelopment Co., which runs logistics facilities within the\nBeijing Capital International Airport.  Global Logistic is seeking more space amid concerns about\nthe economic outlook of its two key markets. Japan said this\nweek its gross domestic product rose an annualized 1.4 percent\nin the three months through June, slower than the median 2.3\npercent forecast of 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. An\naging population and two decades of low growth have also left\nthe nation with a debt pile projected to exceed 1 quadrillion\nyen ($12.7 trillion) next year, the biggest in the world.  Circumvent Slowdown  China\u2019s manufacturing teetered on the edge of contraction\nin July, adding to signs of a deepening global slowdown as\n Europe \u2019s debt crisis curbs demand for the region\u2019s goods. Chua\nat CIMB said Global Logistic was able to \u201ccircumvent\u201d the\nslowdown in the last quarter.  The company has  operations  in 29 cities in China with a net\nasset value of $3.65 billion as of June 30, according to its\npresentation this week. In Japan, it\u2019s in seven key locations\nwith a combined net asset value of $3.93 billion.  \u201cNew demand is from new economic growth in China,\u201d Mei\nsaid. Japan\u2019s \u201csteady, strong cash flow will fuel the growth in\nChina as we want to rebalance the portfolios. We tend to grow\nfaster in China,\u201d he said.  Global Logistic raised S$3.5 billion ($2.8 billion) in\nOctober 2010 in what was Singapore\u2019s biggest IPO since 1993. It\nis a unit of the Government of Singapore Investment Corp., which\nmanages more than $100 billion of the nation\u2019s reserves.  Mei expects a longer time frame before total assets in both\ncountries reach \u201cequilibrium.\u201d Global Logistic has $8.3\nbillion of assets in Japan and $5.7 billion in China, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, it\u2019s not glamorous, but it\u2019s what everyone\nuses every day that goes through our warehouses,\u201d Mei said.
