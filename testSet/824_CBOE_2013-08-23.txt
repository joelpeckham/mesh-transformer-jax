 "context": "The following article called 'NYSE Said to Void Most Goldman Sachs Erroneous Options Trades' was published on 2013-08-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMost of the trades caused when\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. bombarded NYSE Amex Options with\nerroneous orders have been canceled, a person with direct\nknowledge of the matter said.  The decision by the exchange where most of the transactions\noccurred will limit losses at the fifth-biggest bank by assets\nafter it roiled options markets three days ago. More than half\nof Goldman\u2019s trades and a greater percentage of its volume from\nthe first  13 minutes  of the day will be voided by NYSE Amex,\naccording to the person, who asked not to be named because the\nmatter is private.  A programming error that spewed orders that pushed prices\non dozens of contracts to a dollar each, according to a person\nbriefed on the matter Aug. 20 and data compiled by Bloomberg.\nHow exchanges would rule on trades that qualified as \u201cclearly\nerroneous\u201d orders was key to quantifying Goldman\u2019s losses.  Rich Adamonis , a spokesman for NYSE Euronext, and  Michael DuVally  at Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the trades.  \u201cGoldman clearly wanted as many of those trades busted as\npossible,\u201d Mark S. Longo, a former market maker and chief\nexecutive officer of Options Insider Inc., said by phone today.\n\u201cThey were the ones who put the trades on at excruciating\nprices. The more cancellations they could get the better for\nGoldman.\u201d  Options Trades  The malfunction affected securities with ticker symbols\nstarting with the letters I, J and K. Of the 500 biggest options\ntrades in the first 15 minutes markets were open on Aug. 20, 405\nwere for those tickers and priced at $1, according to data\ncompiled by Trade Alert LLC and Bloomberg.  NYSE Amex Options accounted for 76 percent of those,\ncompared with 18 percent for Nasdaq Options Market and 12\npercent for the International Securities Exchange, data show.  NYSE Euronext\u2019s options venue  said  less than two hours\nafter the malfunction that, \u201cas permitted by the rules, we\nanticipate that most of the impacted trades will be busted.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs, which generated $5.8 billion in revenue from\nequities last year, said in an e-mail that any potential losses\nwould be within the firm\u2019s risk limits and not material to its\nfinances.  Goldman Sachs shares  fell  0.8 percent to $158.21 at 1:31\np.m. in New York after rising 1.5 percent yesterday.  The majority of the reviewed trades at the International\nSecurities Exchange were adjusted and not canceled, based on the\nexchange\u2019s rules, according to spokeswoman Molly McGregor. Bats\nGlobal Markets Inc. let the few hundred trades on that venue\nstand while Boston Options Exchanges adjusted trades.  CBOE, BATS  Chicago Board Options Exchange, operated by  CBOE Holdings\nInc. (CBOE) , said it reviewed the trades as obvious errors when a\nrequest for review was received within its time limit, which is\n60 minutes.  Randy Williams, a Bats spokesman, Tony McCormick, chief\nexecutive officer of the Boston Options Exchange, Robert Madden\nof Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and CBOE\u2019s Gail Osten declined to\ncomment for this story.  \u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you look at how ISE does it one way, CBOE\ndoes it another way, Amex does it yet another way, that is\nabsurd and it is demonstrably dangerous,\u201d Longo said. \u201cLet\u2019s\nsay you\u2019re a market maker and you put up the same trade on three\ndifferent exchanges, then you have three different processes you\nhave to deal with to bust or adjust the exact same trade and you\nmay have three different outcomes. How is that beneficial to\nanybody?\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSam Mamudi in New York at \n smamudi@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nLynn Thomasson at \n lthomasson@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CBOE Holdings, Inc. was 45.22620391845703 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CBOE Holdings, Inc. was ",
