 "context": "The following article called 'China Set to Exit Slowdown by Boosting Infrastructure' was published on 2013-01-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina\u2019s economy  is set to exit a seven-quarter slowdown as the government rolls out infrastructure projects and limited  inflation  lets officials hold off from tightening monetary policy.  The National Bureau of Statistics will report tomorrow that gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to the median  estimate  of 53 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. That\u2019s up from a three-year low of 7.4 percent in the previous period.  The risk is that the rebound may fade in the second half as the boost from railways and road projects ebbs and the government grapples with rising inflation and the expansion of shadow banking. While the nation is set to reverse its slide in economic growth, the pace remains short of the 10 percent average of the past two decades as higher  wages  and weakness in global demand limit export gains.  \u201cThe current recovery is being driven mostly by monetary and fiscal policy easing,\u201d said Zhang Zhiwei, chief  China  economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  Hong Kong . \u201cOnce the momentum of policy easing slows, growth may trend down again.\u201d  Tomorrow\u2019s report will also include the latest monthly data. Factory  output  probably rose 10.2 percent in December from a year earlier, up from 10.1 percent in November, while retail sales advanced 15.1 percent after a 14.9 percent gain the prior month, according to median analyst estimates.  Investment Pace  Fixed-asset investment excluding rural areas may have increased 20.7 percent for the full year, based on economist  forecasts , the same pace as in the first 11 months of 2012.  Improving investor confidence in China\u2019s outlook has lifted mainland stocks and the currency. The Shanghai Composite  Index (SHCOMP) , the nation\u2019s benchmark gauge, had advanced 18 percent as of yesterday from an almost four-year low on Dec. 3. It fell 0.6 percent as of 9:53 a.m. local time today. The  yuan  traded this week at a 19-year high against the dollar.  Societe Generale SA is turning more optimistic for the next six months. Yao Wei, the bank\u2019s Hong Kong-based China economist, raised her first-quarter growth estimate to 8.2 percent from 7.8 percent and second-quarter forecast to 7.9 percent from 7.5 percent, according to a report today.  \u201cThe degree of improvement in almost all the major growth data from China in the past few weeks exceeded our initial expectations,\u201d said Yao, ranked by Bloomberg as the most accurate forecaster for quarterly GDP. At the same time, Yao said she expects the momentum to fade in the second half, with growth slowing to 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter.  \u2018More Cautious\u2019  Nomura\u2019s Zhang sees the recovery ebbing to a greater degree, projecting expansion of 7.3 percent in the second half after 8.1 percent in the first half. The central bank may raise  interest rates  twice in the second half to limit inflation, said Zhang, who previously worked for the  International Monetary Fund . \u201cPolicy will turn gradually from the current very loose stance to a more cautious one,\u201d he said.  Inflation accelerated more than forecast to 2.5 percent in December, statistics bureau data showed on Jan. 11, while new local-currency loans had a greater-than-estimated drop. A broader  measure  of financing surged 28 percent, highlighting the economic rebound\u2019s increasing dependence on non-bank credit that may add risks.  Analysts at companies including UBS AG and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. questioned an unexpectedly large increase in December\u2019s exports, saying it may fail to capture the true picture.  Wage Growth  \u201cThe recovery so far is led by accelerating public investment and stronger exports to Asian countries,\u201d said Joy Yang, chief  Greater China  economist at Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd., a former IMF researcher. \u201cHowever, we have not seen clear signs of recovery in the private sector and in addition, consumption this year will likely be capped by slower wage growth and rising unemployment pressures.\u201d  Auto sales in China rose 4.3 percent to 19.3 million last year, missing official projections for deliveries of as many as 20 million made in July.  Nike Inc., the world\u2019s largest sporting-goods company, said Dec. 20 that it continued to see its business in China deteriorate as orders decreased 7 percent in its fiscal second quarter ended Nov. 30.  The central bank has paused from its monetary easing since July after two interest-rate cuts and three reductions in lenders\u2019 reserve  requirements  starting in November 2011. At the same time, the government has accelerated investment-project approvals, trimmed fees for exporters and increased spending on infrastructure.  Economists Split  Economists are split on whether China will ease monetary policy this year as the ruling Communist Party completes a once- a-decade leadership transition. While 12 of 19 analysts surveyed last month forecast a cut in banks\u2019 reserve requirements, 13 of 28 see no change in the benchmark lending rate, with nine projecting an increase and six seeing a reduction.  Full-year  expansion  in 2012 was probably 7.7 percent, the weakest since 1999, and may pick up to 8.1 percent this year before slowing to 8 percent in 2014, based on analyst forecasts.  --Zheng Lifei.
