 "context": "The following article called 'Amazon Readies Kindle Fire Update to Keep Up in Tablets' was published on 2012-09-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  is readying an\nupdated Kindle Fire tablet, seeking to revive demand for the 10-\nmonth-old device as the market crowds with competing machines\nfrom  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)   Amazon is holding an event at 10:30 a.m. today in  Santa\nMonica ,  California , where it is likely to announce the newest\nversions of its line of Kindle e-readers and the Kindle Fire\ntablet, according to  Anthony DiClemente , an analyst at Barclays\nPlc. The company said it sold out of the Kindle Fire last week.  Last year\u2019s holiday shoppers helped vault Amazon\u2019s share of\nthe market to 17 percent in the December period, according to\nresearch firm IDC. Demand for the Kindle Fire has since stalled\n-- the device\u2019s first-quarter share slipped to 4 percent. To\nstay relevant in tablets, Amazon needs to tap consumers\u2019 desire\nfor streaming movies and video games they can\u2019t find elsewhere,\nsaid Edward Williams, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big opportunity for Amazon to design digital\ncontent that specifically exploits the Kindle Fire,\u201d Williams,\nwho is based in  New York , said in an interview. \u201cPeople who own\nthe Kindle Fire are probably watching content that was\nrepurposed for it. Apple has done a phenomenal job at this.\nThere\u2019s room for another player in the market, and Amazon has a\ngood chance, but we\u2019re definitely dealing with version one right\nnow.\u201d  New Entrants  In June, both Microsoft and Google announced their own\ntablets, pushing into a market that may reach $66.4 billion this\nyear, according to research firm DisplaySearch. And Apple plans\nto debut a smaller, cheaper iPad by year-end, two people with\nknowledge of the plans said in July.  Google, which makes the Android software that runs the\nKindle Fire, is entering the running with the Nexus 7, a tablet\nthat is thinner, lighter and has better screen resolution than\nthe current Kindle Fire for the same $199 price. Both have 8\ngigabytes of storage and a 7-inch display, though Google buyers\nhave the option to upgrade to 16 gigabytes for $249.  The Nexus 7 also boasts Bluetooth connectivity, GPS and a\ncamera -- features Amazon\u2019s tablet now lacks.  Microsoft\u2019s device, the Surface, has a 10.6-inch display\nand also is slimmer than the Fire. It will run on Microsoft\u2019s\nrevamped Windows operating system and has a cover that serves as\na full keyboard with a track pad. Microsoft hasn\u2019t yet announced\nthe Surface\u2019s price.  \u201cThere\u2019s still room for improvement\u201d in the Kindle Fire,\nWilliams said.  Digital Content  Amazon started selling the Kindle Fire in November, seeking\nto extend its success in e-readers into the fast-growing tablet\nmarket, where shipments may almost double to 116 million units\nthis year, Gartner estimates. Still, its entry came at a cost to\nprofitability -- Amazon spends $139.80 to make each Kindle Fire,\naccording to IHS.  Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Bezos  is pushing sales of\ndigital content -- movies, books, music and other media -- on\nthe device to make up for the low price. To gain that loyalty\nand woo buyers, the company needs to ensure users become\naddicted to a digital experience they can only get at Amazon.\nGames may be an easy way to do that, Williams said.  Amazon has \u201cthe books, they\u2019ve got the videos, they\u2019ve got\nthe music, but where they\u2019re still lacking is on the game side\nof it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably an area that\ncan get a little more focus on the next-generation device.\u201d  Social Games  Amazon announced GameCircle in July, which gives developers\nthe ability to make games more social by adding leader boards\nand a way to track trophies and achievements. The ability to\nmake more sophisticated games may draw more app makers to\nAmazon\u2019s device. For every $1 generated for developers in\nApple\u2019s iTunes  App Store , they earn 89 cents in Amazon\u2019s and 23\ncents in Google\u2019s, according to Flurry, a provider of app-\nanalytics software.  Amazon, based in  Seattle , said in August that exclusive\nKindle books have been purchased, downloaded or borrowed from\nthe company\u2019s virtual lending library more than 100 million\ntimes. Amazon doesn\u2019t give revenue figures for purchases on the\ntablet. The company\u2019s sales of all digital media last year\nreached $17.8 million and accounted for 37 percent of revenue,\n data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  To sweeten the selection of movies and TV shows available\non the Fire, the company has been striking agreements with\ncontent providers. Amazon reached a deal with pay-television\nchannel Epix this week to offer films such as \u201cThe Hunger\nGames\u201d through its instant video service.  New Features  At today\u2019s event, Amazon may announce more than one tablet\nand offer the option to upgrade memory for a higher price,\nBarclays\u2019s DiClemente said in a note to clients this week. The\ncompany may also add a built-in camera and let users connect to\nthe Web through a cellular network. Right now, the device can\nonly access the Internet through a wireless connection.  An updated and aggressively priced tablet \u201ccould be very\nattractive to the lower end of the market, and may help to stave\noff some share gains from the Google Nexus 7 and a possible iPad\nmini entrant,\u201d DiClemente wrote, noting that the original\nKindle e-reader cost about $400, compared with a $79 price point\nfor the cheapest current version.  Loyal Members  To drive purchases of the Kindle Fire as well as movies,\nmusic and other content, Amazon can further leverage its\nmillions of users with registered credit-card numbers, a one-\nclick payment option and loyal Prime members, who pay $79 a year\nfor free shipping and free access to some movies and videos --\nadvantages Google doesn\u2019t have, said Atul Bagga, an analyst at\nLazard Capital Markets in  San Francisco .  The company may have sold about 7 million Kindle Fires\nsince the device\u2019s release in November and will control 10\npercent of the worldwide tablet market by 2016, Bagga estimates.\nDigital sales on the device will help boost an operating margin\nthat narrowed to 1.79 percent last year, lower than 96 percent\nof companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, data compiled\nby Bloomberg show.  \u201cDigital media -- selling apps, selling music, selling\ngames -- that\u2019s a high-margin business,\u201d Bagga said. \u201cThese\nthings position Amazon as a very strong contender in the digital\nmedia space. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some meaningful\nchanges to the Fire.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDanielle Kucera in San Francisco at \n dkucera6@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTom Giles at \n tgiles5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 20.610679626464844 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
