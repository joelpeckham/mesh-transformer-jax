 "context": "The following article called 'Accounting Body Changes Rule to Close Structured-Product Reporting Anomaly' was published on 2010-10-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  International Accounting\nStandards Board  is amending the treatment of so-called own\ncredit risk on financial liabilities, closing a loophole that\nbanks have used to show bigger profits on structured debt.  Under current rules, banks book a fair-value gain on\nsecurities including structured products even as credit spreads\nwiden and the lender is perceived to be more risky.  The new ruling is designed to \u201caddress the counter-\nintuitive way a company in severe financial trouble can book a\nlarge profit based on its theoretical ability to buy back its\nown debt at a reduced cost,\u201d  David Tweedie , chairman of the\nIASB, said in a statement today.  Starting Jan. 1, 2013, banks will be required to report\nfair-value adjustments on their debt in the \u201cother\ncomprehensive income\u201d section of income statements instead of\nwithin the  profit and loss  account, the IASB said.  The own credit accounting convention is used mainly on\nstructured notes as an alternative to valuing the products\u2019 debt\nand derivatives components separately. While fair value losses\nand gains are only realized if a bank buys back the debt, the\nreporting method causes earnings volatility, the IASB said.  UBS AG  reported a 387 million-franc ($393 million) fair-\nvalue loss on financial liabilities, consisting mainly of\n\u201cissued structured products,\u201d the Zurich-based bank said in\nits third-quarter earnings statement on Oct. 26. UBS reported a\nfair-value gain of 595 million francs on similar liabilities in\nthe second quarter.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which\npackage debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to\ninvestors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are\ncontracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies\nand commodities.
