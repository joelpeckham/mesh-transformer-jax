 "context": "The following article called 'Yen Falls for 11th Week on Bets Japan Will Push It Down Further' was published on 2013-01-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe yen slid against the dollar in\nthe longest weekly losing streak on record as investors who bet\non bold action from the  Bank of Japan (8301)  were encouraged by\nofficials suggesting the currency has further to fall.  The euro rose to an 11-month high versus the dollar as the\n European Central Bank  said lenders will hand back a greater\namount of three-year loans next week than forecast. The yen fell\nfor an 11th week as Deputy Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura\nsaid its drop isn\u2019t over and a 100-per-dollar level wouldn\u2019t be\na concern. The  Federal Reserve  opens a two-day meeting Jan. 29.  \u201cThe BOJ is the whole story there,\u201d  Fabian Eliasson , vice\npresident of corporate foreign-exchange sales at Mizuho\nFinancial Group Inc. in  New York , said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cThis latest comment coming out that the 100 level is where\nthey think is a good level for it to be is what\u2019s pushing this\nlast move.\u201d  The yen slid 0.9 percent to 90.91 per dollar this week in\nNew York trading. It touched 91.19, the weakest level since June\n2010. The yen has never previously lost for 11 straight weeks,\naccording to records compiled by Bloomberg dating to 1971.\n Japan \u2019s currency tumbled 2 percent against the euro to 122.32.\nIt was the seventh weekly loss, the longest run since July 2008.  The euro gained 1.1 percent to $1.3464 and touched $1.3474,\nthe strongest level since Feb. 29.  Net Shorts  Futures traders decreased bets for a sixth straight week\nthat the yen will decline against the U.S. dollar, figures from\nthe Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and\nother large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with\nthose on a gain -- so-called net  shorts  -- was 64,068 on Jan.\n22, compared with net shorts of 65,727 a week earlier.  Traders increased bets the euro will gain against the\ndollar, known as net longs, to 21,381, the most since July 2011,\nfrom 7,315 the week before, CFTC data show.  Canada \u2019s dollar and  South Africa \u2019s rand slid versus most of\nthe U.S. dollar\u2019s 16 most-traded counterparts.  The Canadian currency fell after the  Bank of Canada  said\nthe need to raise interest rates is less urgent as the economy\nwill take longer to reach full output. The loonie, as the\ncurrency is nicknamed for the image of the bird on the C$1 coin,\nsank 1.4 percent to C$1.0058 per  U.S. dollar .  Rand Drops  The South African currency fell Jan. 24 to 9.0878 to the\ngreenback, the weakest level in almost four years. Credit Suisse\nGroup AG reduced its three-month forecast for the currency to\n9.2 per U.S. dollar from 8.7, citing the risk of social and\npolitical instability from consolidation in the mining sector.  The rand ended the week down 0.7 percent to 8.9446 to the\nU.S. currency.  Norway\u2019s krone was the biggest winner against the\ngreenback, advancing 1.4 percent to 5.5222 per dollar.  The euro gained as the ECB said 278 banks will repay 137.2\nbillion euros ($184.4 billion) next week, versus an 84 billion-\neuro forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Europe \u2019s central bank flooded financial markets a year ago\nwith two tranches of Longer-Term Refinancing Operations, or\nLTRO, totaling more than 1 trillion euros after banks stopped\nlending to each other due to the sovereign-debt crisis.  \u201cThe repayment is much higher than the market expected,\nand it\u2019s positive for the euro,\u201d  Roberto Mialich , a senior\ncurrency strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan, said yesterday.\n\u201cBanks, which were part of the euro problem, are willing and\nable to make repayment to the ECB, and this will provide further\nupward momentum.\u201d  \u2018Key Driver\u2019  The difference between rates on two-year  interest-rate\nswaps  denominated in euros and comparable swaps in dollars\nwidened yesterday to 24 basis points, or 0.24 percentage point,\nthe most since July, from 16 basis points on Jan. 24. The euro\nrate was 0.42 percent, and the dollar rate was 0.66 percent.  \u201cA key driver of any currency is the two-year  interest\nrate ,\u201d Dan Dorrow, head of research in Stamford,  Connecticut ,\nat Faros Trading LLC, said in a telephone interview. The LTRO\nrepayments show \u201cbanks are able to fund themselves,\u201d he said.  The yen fell 7.4 percent in the past month, the biggest\ndecline among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by\nBloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 2.5\npercent, and the dollar was little changed.  The Japanese currency rallied as much as 1.4 percent on\nJan. 22, the biggest intraday jump since May, after the BOJ\nraised its inflation target to 2 percent and said it will\nconduct open-ended asset purchases starting in January 2014. The\ndate disappointed investors who expected bolder action sooner.  \u2018New Ground\u2019  \u201cThey have broken new ground by raising inflation,\u201d Shahab Jalinoos, a senior currency strategist at UBS AG in  Stamford ,\nConnecticut, said Jan. 22 in a telephone interview. \u201cThe problem\nis that the actual measures they\u2019re using to reach those targets\nappear too weak to actually have the effect on inflation that\nthe target would require.\u201d  The yen reversed gains Jan. 24 after Deputy Economy\nMinister Nishimura said in an interview in  Tokyo  the current\nlevel of about 90 yen per dollar \u201ccan be said to be a\ncorrection of the strong yen, but it isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pressed since his\nelection last month to steer monetary policy to jumpstart an\neconomy in which prices haven\u2019t risen since 2008. He has a\nchance to reshape the nation\u2019s central bank with the end of BOJ\nGovernor  Masaaki Shirakawa \u2019s five-year term in April.  The U.S. central bank will issue a policy statement after\nits meeting ends on Jan. 30.
