 "context": "The following article called 'China Mobile Profit Gain Capped by Costs to Add 3G Users' was published on 2013-08-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina Mobile Ltd. (941) , the world\u2019s\nlargest phone company by users, posted a 2.5 percent rise in\nsecond-quarter profit as costs to add new subscribers to its\nthird-generation network restrained growth.  Net income  rose to 35.2 billion  yuan  ($5.8 billion) from\n34.4 billion yuan a year earlier, according to figures derived\nfrom first-half results released by the Beijing-based company\ntoday. The profit beat the 33.9 billion-yuan average of four\n analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Li Yue is luring subscribers to 3G\nwith subsidies on a range of devices, including Huawei\nTechnologies Co.\u2019s Ascend P6 that is advertised as the world\u2019s\nslimmest smartphone. Handset subsidies, which hit 14.2 billion\nyuan in the first half, and the rollout of 4G services are\nchoking profit growth with the latest results marking the third\ntime in four quarters that earnings rose 3 percent or less.  \u201cThe operating expenses really surged in the first half,\u201d\nsaid Ricky Lai, an analyst at Guotai Junan International\nHoldings Ltd. in  Hong Kong . \u201cThey still need heavy handset\nsubsidies to propel subscriber growth and China Mobile is going\nto suffer from that.\u201d  The company, the only one of China\u2019s three largest carriers\nnot to offer Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone, is expected to report its\nfirst annual profit decline in 14 years, according to analyst\nestimates. China Mobile and Apple are still in talks on the\niPhone, Chairman  Xi Guohua  said at a press conference in Hong\nKong today. The talks are on commercial details and technology\nfor its fourth-generation TD-LTE network, he said.  Sales Surge  Second-quarter sales rose 15 percent to 168.4 billion yuan\nin the quarter. The company was expected to report revenue of\n147.8 billion yuan, according to the average of six  estimates  in\nthe Bloomberg survey.  \u201cThe results are weak\u201d even while beating analyst\nestimates, Bertram Lai, an analyst at CIMB Securities in Hong\nKong, said in an e-mail today. The slow pace of growth was\n\u201clikely driven by handset subsidies.\u201d  China Mobile  rose  0.2 percent to close at HK$84.10 in Hong\nKong trading. The  shares  have dropped 6.8 percent this year\nwhile the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  is little changed.  The company is looking to mobile web users who download\ngames and movies to help stem a decline in its share of the\nnation\u2019s 1.18 billion wireless users.  4G Network  The carrier\u2019s 740.2 million wireless subscribers accounted\nfor 63 percent of China\u2019s total users at the end of June, down\nfrom 65 percent a year earlier, according to data the company\nreleased last month. Its share of the nation\u2019s 1.18 billion\nwireless users has dropped from 68 percent two years ago.  China Mobile is backing smartphones to stem that decline.\nThe company added 23.5 million 3G users in the quarter for a\ntotal of 137.9 million at the end of June, according to data the\ncompany released last month.  \u201c China  Mobile\u2019s 3G business is starting to gain\ntraction,\u201d Wang Jinjin, an analyst at UBS AG in Hong Kong,\nwrote in an Aug. 13 report. Data usage \u201chas taken off driven by\nmore smartphones since late last year.\u201d  The carrier is also moving to add fourth-generation\nservices.  China Mobile is actively preparing for commercialization of\n4G, CEO Li said at the press conference in Hong Kong today.\nChina Mobile has 15 handsets ready for service on the faster\nnetwork with more than 100 models of 4G devices in development,\nhe said.  Network Costs  After building a trial 4G network in 15 cities in 2012,\nChina Mobile in February said it will expand that to 100 cities\nthis year, with 200,000 base stations that can reach a\npopulation of 500 million people. China\u2019s government may issue\nlicenses for 4G commercial service toward the end of this year,\nthe company said in March.  Some costs for the 4G rollout that were previously borne by\nits state-owned parent are now being shouldered by the listed\nunit, which will boost its  capital spending  49 percent to 190.2\nbillion yuan this year, the company said in March.  First-half revenue from the sale of products more than\ndoubled to 18.4 billion yuan, a category China Mobile previously\ntreated as \u201cincidental,\u201d it said in today\u2019s filing.  With rising costs for its high-speed networks, China Mobile\nhas been reporting some of the weakest financial results since\nlisting in Hong Kong in 1997. The company is projected to report\na 1.3 percent drop in full-year net income to 127.6 billion\nyuan, according to the average of 23  estimates  in the Bloomberg\nsurvey.
