 "context": "The following article called 'Absa Profit Rises 19% on Retail Bank Growth, Cost Controls' was published on 2012-02-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAbsa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African\nbank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , said full-year profit increased\n19 percent on improved income from  consumer banking  and lower\ncosts.  Net income climbed to 9.67 billion rand ($1.27 billion)\nfrom 8.12 billion rand a year earlier, Johannesburg-based Absa\nsaid today in a statement. Earnings per share excluding one-time\nitems rose to 13.55 rand, beating the 13.26-rand median  estimate \nof 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bad loans as a percentage\nof total lending shrank to 1.01 percent, and that ratio should\nshrink below 1 percent in 2012, the bank said.  Absa, South  Africa \u2019s largest retail lender, has been trying\nto contain the cost of implementing technology systems as it\nintegrates operations with Barclays across Africa. Along with\nrivals  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  and Standard Bank Group Africa Ltd., Absa\nwants to boost profit by tapping into the continent\u2019s 1 billion\npeople as economic growth outpaces developed regions.  The bank\u2019s 1.32 percent return on assets was \u201cpleasing,\u201d\nthough the credit-loss ratio remains too high due to older bad\nloans, said Johann Scholtz, an analyst at Afrifocus Securities\nin  Cape Town , who gives Absa his only \u201cbuy\u201d rating among  South\nAfrica \u2019s four largest lenders. His  recommendations  on Absa\nproduced the best total returns in the past year.  The  stock  rose 0.9 percent to a record high of 151.88 rand\nand was up 0.3 percent to 150.91 rand as of 10:24 a.m. in\nJohannesburg trading.  \u201cImproved non-interest revenue growth, lower credit\nlosses, better cost containment and a wider net interest margin\nwere the primary reasons for Absa\u2019s headline earnings growth,\u201d\nthe lender said. \u201cManagement is committed to keeping cost\ngrowth below revenue growth again this year.\u201d  Dividend Increase  The firm boosted its final  dividend  by 70 percent to 3.92\nrand a share, increasing the year\u2019s total payout by 50 percent\nto 6.84 rand. Absa is confident its dividend levels are\nsustainable, financial director David Hodnett said on a\nconference call.  \u201cI\u2019m surprised by the timing and the mechanism chosen to\nreturn surplus capital,\u201d given that local regulators haven\u2019t\ndecided on how South African banks should approach international\nBasel III capital rules, Afrifocus\u2019s Scholtz said. A one-time\nspecial dividend would have given Absa more flexibility, he\nsaid.  Absa is unlikely to boost lending in the coming year given\nthe bank\u2019s limited risk appetite, Deputy Chief Executive Officer\nLouis von Zeuner said on the call.  Absa shares have gained 7 percent in 2012. It\u2019s the second-\nworst performing stock on the six-member  FTSE/JSE Africa Banks\nIndex (JBNKS)  this year after Capitec Bank Holdings Ltd.
