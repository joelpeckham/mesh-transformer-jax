 "context": "The following article called 'Peugeot Is In Talks With General Motors on Possible Alliance; Shares Surge' was published on 2012-02-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGeneral Motors Co. (GM)  and  PSA Peugeot\nCitroen (UG)  are in talks to form a broad partnership as the two\nautomakers struggle with declining car sales in Europe.  The alliance may include developing engines and building\nvehicles together in the region, a person familiar with the\ndiscussion said today, declining to be identified because the\ntalks aren\u2019t public. Peugeot  rose  the most in almost three\nyears.  GM, the world\u2019s largest carmaker, is looking for ways to\nturn around its unprofitable Opel brand, while Peugeot is\nseeking to stem a growing debt load. Peugeot\u2019s 2011 sales in the\nregion plunged 8.8 percent to 1.68 million vehicles. GM\u2019s\ndropped 1.9 percent to 1.17 million. Auto executives expect\ndeliveries in the region to shrink in 2012 for a fifth year.  \u201cA partnership with GM would make sense, because Peugeot\nand Opel both lack scale,\u201d said Sascha Gommel, a Frankfurt-\nbased Commerzbank analyst with a \u201chold\u201d rating on Peugeot\nshares, adding that  Fiat (F)  SpA is also a potential partner.  Peugeot shares gained 1.74 euros, or 12 percent, to 16.13\neuros as of the close of trading in Paris. The stock has  slumped \n44 percent over the last 12 months, bringing its market value to\n3.77 billion euros ($5 billion). GM fell 1.9 percent to $26.55\nat the close in  New York .  GM Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson declined to comment\nto reporters at a Habitat for Humanity event in Detroit. Klaus- Peter Martin, a GM spokesman, said earlier \u201cwe routinely talk\nwith others in the industry\u201d while not commenting beyond that.\nJonathan Goodman, a Peugeot spokesman, reiterated comments the\nParis-based carmaker made last night that it was in discussions\non possible partnerships without providing specifics.  Borrowed Shares  About 6.8 percent of Peugeot\u2019s stock, the second-highest in\nthe European auto sector after Fiat, has been lent out,\naccording to  Data Explorers  in  London , most likely to\nspeculators who are betting the shares will fall. In a short\nsale, traders borrow securities to sell them on expectations\nthey will be able to buy them back at a cheaper price.  Peugeot Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin informed\nFrench Labor Minister Xavier Bertrand of the talks yesterday,\nBertrand said in an interview with radio station Europe1 today.  Varin said last week that the company was willing to\ninvestigate partnerships as long as they were in line with the\ngroup\u2019s strategy, including expansion outside Europe, and\ncontributed synergies while maintaining Peugeot\u2019s independence.  Peugeot, Europe\u2019s second-biggest automaker after Volkswagen\nAG, announced plans last week to sell 1.5 billion euros in\nassets to reduce debt, which widened to 3.4 billion euros as\nprofit and sales fell.  CDS Drop  Should the outcome of talks with Detroit-based GM be\npositive, an accord may be announced at the Geneva car show the\nfirst week of March, French newspaper La Tribune reported last\nnight, adding that the discussing have been going on for several\nmonths.  Peugeot\u2019s credit-default swaps fell 46.5 basis points today\nto a two-week low of 461, a 9 percent decline, according to CMA\nprices. A decline in credit-default swap prices indicates an\nimprovement in perceptions of creditworthiness.  A basis point on a default swap protecting 10 million euros\nof debt for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. CMA,\nwhich is owned by CME Group Inc., compiles prices quoted by\ndealers in the privately negotiated market.  Opel Losses  GM, which last week posted a record annual net income of\n$9.19 billion for 2011, is planning more cost cuts for its\nunprofitable European unit after the last turnaround plan failed\nto end losses there.  The automaker\u2019s  Europe  business, including the Opel brand,\nlost $747 million last year before taxes and interest. While\nthat\u2019s an improvement from $1.95 billion lost in 2010, GM had\nplanned to break even in the region until November, when it\npulled back the forecast as the European outlook worsened.  Peugeot, whose origins date back to the early 19th century\nlaminated steel- and toolmaker Peugeot-Fr\u00e8res et Jacques\nMaillard-Salins, is still 30 percent owned by the Peugeot\nfamily, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company\u2019s current chairman Thierry Peugeot is the\ngreat-grandson of Eugene, who jointly led the company with his\ncousin Armand when it produced its first automobile in 1891.\nThierry is joined on the board by relatives Roland, Robert and\nJean-Philippe Peugeot, and Marie-Helene Roncoroni.  Blackrock Inc. last year became the second-largest investor\nwith 5 percent, according to a regulatory filing.  Consolidation Needed  Fiat isn\u2019t currently in talks with Peugeot, a person\nfamiliar with the matter said today, declining to be identified\ndiscussing a private topic.  Fiat CEO  Sergio Marchionne  said last month in Detroit he\u2019s\nwilling to participate in industry consolidation in Europe and\nwould consider adding a third partner before a planned merger\nbetween Fiat and U.S. automaker Chrysler Group LLC.  Carmakers in Europe need to consolidate to compete with VW,\nwhich had a market share in the region of 23.3 percent last\nyear, Marchionne said Jan. 10. He said at the time that Fiat\nwasn\u2019t discussing with Peugeot or other potential partners,\nincluding GM\u2019s Opel unit, though he wouldn\u2019t close the door on\nany eventual alliances.  Fiat held talks with Peugeot after the 2008 financial\ncrisis regarding a possible combination, a person familiar with\nthe matter said. Negotiations failed because the Peugeot family\ndidn\u2019t want to lose control over the carmaker, the person said.  Peugeot, whose carmaking division missed a target of\nbreaking even in 2011, said Feb. 15 it will sell property as\nwell as a holding in the Gefco trucking unit that has yet to be\ndetermined. The disposals include the Citer vehicle-rental unit\nthat Peugeot sold to Enterprise Holdings Inc. on Feb. 1 for 440\nmillion euros.  Earnings before interest, taxes and one-time gains or costs\nfell to 1.32 billion euros in 2011 from 1.8 billion euros a year\nearlier, Peugeot said last week. The company\u2019s deliveries\nglobally fell 1.5 percent to 3.5 million vehicles in 2011, led\nby the drop in Europe.
