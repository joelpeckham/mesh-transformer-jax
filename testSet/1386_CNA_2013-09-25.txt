 "context": "The following article called 'Miliband\u2019s U.K. Utility Breakup Plan Threatens Investment' was published on 2013-09-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBritain\u2019s business lobby groups\nsaid the Labour opposition\u2019s proposal to break up the \u201cBig\nSix\u201d utilities and cap power prices threatens the investment\nneeded to avoid blackouts by the end of the decade.  Labour leader  Ed Miliband  said the program would buy time\nfor creating a new energy regulator with the authority to reduce\nconsumer bills. The Confederation of British Industry along with\nCentrica Plc and utilities and renewable-energy groups said the\npolicy may halt decisions on funding new projects.  \u201cIf prices were to be controlled against a background of\nrising costs it would simply not be economically viable for\nCentrica, or indeed any other energy supplier, to continue to\noperate and far less to meet the sizeable investment challenge\nthat the industry is facing,\u201d Centrica said in a statement on\nits website last night. \u201cThe impact of such a policy would be\ndamaging for the country\u2019s long term prosperity.\u201d  The proposal backtracks on Labour\u2019s support for Prime\nMinister  David Cameron \u2019s  energy policy , which is designed to\nlure 110 billion pounds ($175 billion) for replacing older power\nstations. The electricity regulator Ofgem says that funding is\nessential to keep the lights on toward the end of this decade.  \u2018Needed Investment\u2019  \u201cThe proposed energy price freeze will deter much-needed\ninvestment and is at odds with Labour\u2019s pledge to decarbonize\nthe economy and create a million green jobs,\u201d said  John Cridland , director general of the CBI, the nation\u2019s main\nbusiness lobbying group.  The Labour leader said this morning that he\u2019d written to\nthe big energy companies urging them to cooperate with his\nproposal, which will require legislation if his party wins the\nelection due in 2015. He dismissed their objections to the\nplans, calling the companies \u201cpretty unreliable witnesses.\u201d  SSE Plc (SSE)   dropped  as much as 3.9 percent in London trading to\ntheir lowest in almost two months. Centrica Plc  shares fell  2.9\npercent.  \u201cThese are people who are overcharging people so, of\ncourse, they\u2019re going to say when someone calls time on it that\nthey\u2019re not very happy,\u201d Miliband said in an interview on ITV\u2019s\n\u201cDaybreak\u201d program. He told BBC Radio 4 Labour had received\nlegal advice that it could cap prices and that the companies\ncould accommodate that \u201con any reasonable scenario.\u201d  New Legislation  Miliband\u2019s remarks raise indicate Labour may rip up part of\nthe Conservative energy legislation that\u2019s passed most of its\nhurdles in Parliament. His proposals suggest a new round of\nlawmaking to restructure power markets if the opposition wins\nthe next election, which is due in 2015.  \u201cThese significant proposed changes may create a whole new\nlevel of uncertainty,\u201d said Tony Ward, head of power and\nutilities at the consulting firm Ernst & Young LLP. \u201cEach of\nthe changes proposed will require massive change in their own\nright, and collectively will lead to a reassessment of the risks\nof operating in the energy market.\u201d  The most immediate risk is  Electricite de France SA \u2019s talks\nwith the government about building the first new nuclear power\nplant in two decades. All except one of Britain\u2019s 23 atomic\nplants is due to retire from service by 2023.  EDF and the government have yet to agree on a strike price\nfor selling power from the plant, and EDF has said the energy\nrules now in Parliament are essential to underpin the economics\nof its investment. An EDF official declined to comment.  \u2018Greater Uncertainty\u2019  \u201cPrice controls only add greater uncertainty to companies\nwho we need to take the financial risks of energy investment,\u201d\nsaid Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of\nDirectors, a group representing company executives.  Miliband\u2019s office said the move would cost energy companies\nas much as 4.5 billion pounds while helping consumers cope with\na squeeze on their finances caused by the recession and slower\nwage growth.  An average household\u2019s bills for power and gas has risen 68\npercent since the beginning of 2008 even though the economy\ntipped into recession, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThat\u2019s partly because consumer pay for subsidies for wind and\nsolar farms through higher power prices.  \u201cBills could rise a further 50 percent by 2020, mainly due\nto the impact of government policies, renewable subsidies and\nnetwork costs,\u201d Robert Coates, a utilities analyst at Citigroup\nGlobal Markets Inc. in London, wrote in a note to clients today.\n\u201cThe outlook for household incomes remains tough. Current\npolicies are simply unaffordable and will need to change.\u201d  Breakup Vow  Caroline Flint , the Labour member of Parliament in charge\nof energy policy, said a Labour government would split up\nBritain\u2019s six largest gas and electricity companies and force\nthem to trade all their power on the open market to drive down\nprices.  Those proposals aren\u2019t the way to bring greater competition\ninto the market or to provide the range of services which\ndomestic and business customers want, said  Angela Knight , chief\nexecutive of Energy U.K., whose members generate more than 90\npercent of the nation\u2019s electricity.  It sends a \u201cclear message\u201d to overseas investors that the\nU.K. is \u201cclosed for business,\u201d she said. The lobby group\nestimates that halting the funds for power stations threatens\nthe jobs and livelihoods of 600,000 people.  \u2018Ramshackle Infrastructure\u2019  \u201cWe are concerned about the impact that Ed Miliband\u2019s\nproposal would have on investment in Britain\u2019s ramshackle energy\nInfrastructure,\u201d said John Longworth, director general of the\nBritish Chambers of Commerce.  The six largest energy companies are  Centrica Plc (CNA) , EDF\nEnergy Plc, EON SE, SSE Plc, Scottish Power Ltd., a unit of\n Iberdrola SA (IBE) , and  RWE Ag (RWE) \u2019s nPower unit. They each have different\ndivisions generating, trading and supplying electricity and\nnatural gas to households.  Instead of freezing tariffs, the government should recoup\nthe cost of promoting  energy efficiency  and renewables through\ngeneral taxation rather than by adding them to household energy\nBills, SSE said.  \u201cThis would wipe 110 pounds off the average persons\u2019 bill\nand shift the cost away from those who can\u2019t afford to pay and\non to those who can,\u201d said Brian Lironi, head of media at SSE.  Clean energy developments currently support 110,000 jobs,\nwith the potential for 400,000 in 2020, according to estimates\nfrom the U.K.\u2019s Renewable Energy Association. Labour\u2019s proposals\nmay slow investment in low-carbon plants such as wind and solar\ninstallations, the industry\u2019s lobby group said.  \u201cThe big question is: how can Labour square a major reform\nof the consumer energy market and a freeze on energy bills with\nthe urgent need for investment in low-carbon generation?\u201d asked\nNina Skorupska, chief executive officer of the REA. \u201cWe cannot\nafford another investment hiatus.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nLouise Downing in  London  at \n ldowning4@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nReed Landberg at \n landberg@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CNA Financial Corporation was 21.45323371887207 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CNA Financial Corporation was ",
