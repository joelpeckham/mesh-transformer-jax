 "context": "The following article called 'Obama Confident of Europe Debt Progress as G-20 Concludes' was published on 2012-06-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. President  Barack Obama \nexpressed confidence that European leaders will reverse the\ndeepening crisis over sovereign debt on the continent.  Euro zone leaders showed \u201ca heightened sense of urgency\u201d\nduring the Group of 20 summit of leaders of major industrialized\nnations in Los Cabos, Mexico, Obama said at the conclusion of\nthe meeting.  During the next several weeks, euro zone leaders will\n\u201cpaint a picture of where we need to go\u201d and \u201ctake some\nimmediate steps\u201d to demonstrate resolve to financial markets,\nthe president said. \u201cIf people have a sense of where they are\ngoing, that can provide confidence break the fever.\u201d  Obama devoted his final scheduled trip abroad before the\nelection to pressing foreign leaders to stimulate growth and\nurging European leaders to take decisive action on the\ncontinent\u2019s sovereign debt crisis. He met on the sidelines of\nthe summit with euro zone leaders, as well as Russian President\n Vladimir Putin  and Chinese President  Hu Jintao .  Obama said he discussed the violence in Syria with Putin\nand Hu, both of whom have acted to protect Syrian President\nBashar al-Assad in the  United Nations Security Council .  He said the Russian and Chinese leaders recognize the\nsituation in Syria \u201cdoes not serve their interests\u201d though he\nstopped short of saying they are ready to abandon Assad.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  said earlier in the day\nthat European leaders plan steps to help the region \u201cgrow\nfaster.\u201d Europe is seeking \u201ca framework\u201d for \u201ca stronger set\nof institutions,\u201d including a banking union, before a European\nsummit later this month, he said.  Geithner said the European Union summit June 28-29 will be\n\u201ccritical.\u201d  Greek Elections  After a victory in Greek elections on June 17 for political\nparties that support a European bailout and austerity plan,\nfinancial markets turned on  Spain  as the summit opened. Spanish\n10-year bond yields leaped above the 7 percent level that pushed\nGreece, Ireland and Portugal to call for sovereign rescues for\nthe first time since the euro\u2019s creation.  Spanish bond yields declined and global stocks rose today\nafter the Spanish government met its target at a bill auction\nand the U.S. Federal Reserve prepared to meet on stimulus\nmeasures.  The MSCI All-Country World Index added 1.2 percent at 4\np.m. in New York and the  Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 1\npercent to 1,357.98, with both reaching the highest level in\nmore than a month. The yield on  Spain\u2019s 10-year note  dropped 12\nbasis points to 7.04 percent.  Romney Challenge  In an election in which Obama is running against discontent\nwith the economy as much as Republican challenger  Mitt Romney ,\nthe perils to the global economy may hurt his political\nprospects.  Obama met with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  for 45\nminutes yesterday before the formal G-20 sessions began. He and\nMerkel met again today on the sidelines of the summit together\nwith leaders of the U.K., Italy, France and Spain, as well as\nEuropean Union officials.  Obama met separately with Hu amid signs that  China\u2019s\neconomy , the world\u2019s second-largest, is decelerating. The agenda\nincluded U.S. complaints that China needs to allow its currency\nto appreciate further.  While pressure is building on Merkel to be more\naccommodating to European nations enveloped in the debt crisis,\nshe said today that the new Greek government shouldn\u2019t be\ngranted leeway on the terms of its international bailout.  Europe\u2019s Decision  Obama has called  Europe \u2019s banking and growth crisis a\n\u201ccloud\u201d hanging over the  U.S. economy . Administration\nofficials said they didn\u2019t expect the summit to resolve the\nsovereign debt issue that has led to high borrowing costs and\neconomic contraction in much of Southern Europe.  \u201cLet me also just underscore this isn\u2019t a meeting where we\nexpect Europeans to make decisions about Europe,\u201d said  Michael Froman , deputy national security adviser for international\neconomic affairs, in a briefing for reporters in Washington on\nJune 15.  Froman said concrete steps are more likely at a European\nsummit June 28-29. The ability of the U.S. to get European\nleaders and institutions to take action is limited, he said.
