 "context": "The following article called 'Royal Bank of Canada Profit Rises as Fixed-Income Surges' was published on 2012-11-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRoyal Bank of Canada , the first\nCanadian lender to report fourth-quarter results, said profit\nrose 22 percent on higher trading and investment-banking fees,\nbeating analysts\u2019 estimates.  Net income for the period ended Oct. 31 was C$1.91 billion\n($1.93 billion), or C$1.25 a share, up from C$1.57 billion, or\nC$1.02, a year earlier, the Toronto-based lender said today in a\nstatement. Revenue rose 12 percent to C$7.52 billion.  Royal Bank, Canada\u2019s largest lender by assets, benefited\nfrom a surge in fixed-income trading and gains in its RBC\nCapital Markets investment bank. Analysts and investors expect\nCanadian banks to offset slower growth in consumer lending and\nmortgages with fees for arranging stock sales, trading and\nadvising on takeovers.  \u201cThe capital markets seem to have been good,\u201d John Kinsey, who helps manage about C$1 billion including bank shares\nat Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing\nfor the banks and I think it\u2019s made up for some weakness in\nother areas.\u201d  The company said it had profit excluding some items of\nC$1.27 a share, beating the C$1.26 a share average  estimate  of\n15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Royal Bank  rose  0.5 percent to close at C$58.61 in Toronto.  Capital Markets  \u201cThe capital-markets exposure of Royal has been a love-\nhate relationship with the market for a while,\u201d John Aiken, an\nanalyst with Barclays Plc in Toronto, said in an interview.\n\u201cBut it looks like we\u2019re in an environment now where the market\nis happy to see growing earnings, regardless of where it comes\nfrom.\u201d  Royal Bank set C$362 million aside for bad loans, up from\nC$276 million in the year-earlier period and C$324 million in\nthe third quarter. Royal Bank pared its workforce by 762\nemployees, or 1 percent, to 74,377 employees from the third\nquarter, with the biggest decline in  Canada , according to\nfinancial statements.  Personal and commercial banking profit rose 9.2 percent to\nC$1.03 billion from C$947 million a year ago as balances from\nloans and deposits increased. Net interest margins narrowed to\n2.82 percent in the quarter, from 2.97 percent in the third\nquarter and 2.84 percent in the year-earlier period.  Earnings from capital markets more than tripled to C$410\nmillion from C$125 million a year ago, largely driven by fixed-\nincome trading, the bank said. Underwriting and advisory fees\nrose 35 percent to C$375 million from a year ago.  Trading Revenue  Trading revenue across the bank more than tripled to C$625\nmillion from C$167 million a year ago, the company said.  Wealth-management earnings rose 16 percent to C$207\nmillion, while insurance fell 3 percent to C$194 million, the\nfirm said.  Royal Bank had record annual profit of C$7.54 billion, or\nC$4.93 a share for the year ended Oct. 31, up 17 percent from\nC$6.44 billion, or C$4.19 a share, the lender said.  The bank met its medium-term goals for earnings-per-share\ngrowth, return on equity and dividend payouts. Chief Executive\nOfficer Gordon Nixon said today in a conference call that Royal\nBank will maintain its goals for 2013 despite \u201cheadwinds\u201d for\nthe industry.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that financial-services companies\nwill continue to face headwinds,\u201d Nixon, 55, said. \u201cIn\naddition to regulatory changes, I believe the economic headwinds\nwill continue until there is more improvement in the global\neconomy and we see resolutions to both the European sovereign-\ndebt issues as well as the U.S. issues, particularly the\nimminent fiscal cliff situation.\u201d  Pursuing Acquisitions  Nixon reiterated interest in pursuing asset-management\nacquisitions, though he said a \u201cless friendly regulatory\nenvironment\u201d and heightened capital requirements make mergers\nand acquisitions a challenge.  \u201cWhen you look at potential M&A activity, it has to be\nfinanced with a lot of core equity to ensure that we continue to\ncomply with the capital requirements going forward,\u201d Nixon\nsaid.  Royal Bank is also looking to U.S. consumer and retail\nbusinesses for expansion, considering areas such as the payments\nsystem and online banking, even after selling its North\nCarolina-based RBC Bank to PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in\nMarch.  U.S. Opportunities  \u201cWe do think there is an opportunity to sort of look at\nthe U.S. market from a different perspective,\u201d Nixon said.\n\u201cThere are still some pretty attractive opportunities, at least\nin our view, for us to conservatively continue to take advantage\nof our strength\u201d and expand the firm\u2019s international business,\nhe said.  Canada\u2019s eight-biggest lenders are expected to report\nfourth-quarter profit growth of 17 percent, led by  Bank of Nova\nScotia  and Bank of Montreal, Scotia Capital analyst Kevin Choquette said in a Nov. 20 note to clients.  Bank of Montreal, Canada\u2019s fourth-biggest lender, reports\nresults on Dec. 4, followed by Canadian Imperial Bank of\nCommerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada on\nDec. 6.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , the third-largest lender, reports\nDec. 7.
