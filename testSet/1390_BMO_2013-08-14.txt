 "context": "The following article called 'Build America Suffering Most as Sequestration Bites: Muni Credit' was published on 2013-08-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBuild America Bonds, the federally\nsubsidized municipal bonds orphaned in 2010 after Congress\nfailed to extend their life, are beating Treasuries and\ncorporate debt even as the taxable securities are poised to\nrecord their first losing year.  With $188 billion outstanding, Build America bonds helped\nfinance a bridge spanning San Francisco Bay and dormitories at\nRutgers University in New Jersey. They\u2019ve declined 5.4 percent\nin 2013 through Aug. 12 after gaining every year since April\n2009, when sales began, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.\nThe debt is set to post a negative annual return after investors\npulled the most cash from muni mutual funds since 2011 on\nspeculation that the Federal Reserve would reduce bond\npurchases, said Justin Hoogendoorn, a managing director at BMO\nCapital Markets in  Chicago .  Federal spending cuts resulting from budget sequestration\nare also feeding the losses, Hoogendoorn said. Since March 1,\nstates and cities have received 8.7 percent less toward interest\ncosts from the U.S., prompting some issuers to redeem securities\nbefore they mature.  \u201cYou had both people getting out of bonds and people\ntrying to be a little more judicious on BABs.\u201d Hoogendoorn\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s just a recipe\u201d for negative performance.  Widest Penalty  This would be the first time since 2009 that the taxable\nsecurities earn less than the broader $3.7 trillion municipal-bond market. Compared with 30-year U.S. Treasuries, investors\nare demanding close to the widest yield penalty in 11 months to\nbuy Build America bonds maturing in 26 years, data compiled by\nBloomberg show.  Interest rates on local securities climbed to the highest\nlevels in more than two years as investors withdrew $14.8\nbillion from U.S. muni mutual funds in the eight weeks through\nAug. 7, the most since February 2011, Lipper US Fund Flows data\nshow.  \u201cSellers build up, you don\u2019t have buyers, inventories tend\nto grow, dealers are losing money and they\u2019re forced to get\ntheir positions down, Hoogendoorn said. \u2018\u2018Consequently, it just\nbecomes a rough time.\u201d  The extra yield that investors demand to buy Build Americas\nmaturing in 26 years rather than 30-year federal debt was 1.53\npercentage points July 25, the widest spread since September,\ndata compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield difference was 1.44\npercentage points Aug. 12.  Obama Stimulus  Created under President  Barack Obama \u2019s 2009 economic\nstimulus, Build America bonds gave state and local borrowers a\n35 percent federal subsidy on interest. Congress refused to\nextend the program after 2010. Then came sequestration, after\nthe lawmakers mandated $1.2 trillion in across-the-board\nspending cuts, to begin in 2013 and be spread over nine years,\nas part of a 2011 deal to increase the U.S. debt limit.  U.S. spending cuts of $80.1 billion that started March 1\nbecause of sequestration include reducing subsidy payments for\nBuild America securities by 8.7 percent, according to the\nInternal Revenue Service.  Since the subsidy cuts began, Columbus,  Ohio \u2019s capital\ncity, as well as localities in Illinois,  Wisconsin  and  Minnesota \nhave purchased or plan to buy back some Build America bonds from\ninvestors at 100 percent of principal, plus accrued interest.  \u2018Negative Taste\u2019  The move to reduce federal support \u201cleaves a negative\ntaste\u201d for investors, said Paul Mansour, head of muni research\nat Hartford, Connecticut-based Conning, which oversees about $9\nbillion of munis, including about $1 billion of Build America\ndebt.  While the bonds are poised to lose value in 2013, their\nrelative appeal against Treasuries and company debt make them a\ngood alternative for investors, Hoogendoorn said.  \u201cThe fact that the spreads have widened out more recently\n-- that often creates a better landscape for the product to\ntighten going forward,\u201d Hoogendoorn said.  Build America bonds\u2019 5.4 percent loss this year is less\nthan half the nearly 11 percent drop in value for federal debt\nwith an average maturity of 27 years, Bank of America Merrill\nLynch data show. Corporate securities with an average rating\nthree steps below benchmark obligations and an average maturity\nof 26 years have lost almost 8 percent in 2013.  Higher Income  \u201cFor long-duration accounts, Build America Bonds are still\nvery valuable and provide a good substitute for corporate\nbonds,\u201d Mansour said. \u201cAnd for corporate bonds of similar\nratings, they generally produce higher income.\u201d  California Build America bonds maturing April 2039 and\nrated four steps below benchmark munis by Moody\u2019s Investors\nService traded Aug. 12 with an average yield of about 5.2\npercent, Bloomberg data show. That compares with a yield of 4.6\npercent that Commonwealth Edison Co., a provider of electricity\nin Chicago and northern  Illinois , received when it sold on the\nsame day debt maturing August 2043 and rated two levels below\nthe California Build Americas.  Build America borrowers \u201ctend to be very high quality,\nlarge issuers so they have good liquidity,\u201d said Cynthia Clemson, co-director of muni investments at Eaton Vance, which\noversees $13.4 billion of munis, including $89.1 million of\nBuild America obligations. \u201cIf you can get a little extra yield\nversus some other opportunities, they may make some sense in\npeople\u2019s portfolios.\u201d  Default Risk  Municipalities default less frequently than corporate\nborrowers, according to a Moody\u2019s Investors Service assessment\nof issuers it rates. From 1970 to 2012, an average of 5.7\npercent of munis that were sold a decade or more earlier and had\na junk rating defaulted, compared with 33.9 percent for company\ndebt.  At  4.6 percent , benchmark 30-year munis are at their\nhighest level since April 2011, Bloomberg data show. That\ncompares with  3.76 percent  for federal debt with similar\nmaturity.  The ratio of the two yields, which shows relative value, is\nabout  122 percent , compared with a five-year average of 112\npercent, Bloomberg data show. The higher the ratio, the cheaper\nmunis are compared with Treasuries.  Following are pending sales:  California plans to start selling about $5.5 billion in\nshort-term revenue-anticipation notes today to individual\ninvestors in $5,000 minimum amounts. The securities will mature\nduring the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2014, and\nwill produce funds to help the state manage its cash flow. The\noffering will conclude tomorrow with institutional orders. The\ntax-exempt notes are graded MIG1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service,\nSP-1+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s and F1 by Fitch Ratings, its second-highest level. Units of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS) \nare managing the sale.  The  New York  State Dormitory Authority plans to sell about\n$526.7 million in revenue bonds as early as next week. The\nproceeds will be used to fund construction and to retire lease-revenue debt. The securities are backed by money received for\nuse of dorms on 26 of 29 state university and college campuses,\nserving about 70,000 of the system\u2019s 218,000 students each year.\nThe bonds carry maturities through July 1, 2032.  Bank of America\nCorp. \u2019s Merrill Lynch unit is managing the offering.
