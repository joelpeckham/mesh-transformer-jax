(TIVO) , the digital-video\nrecorder pioneer, posted a second-quarter loss that was smaller\nthan analysts estimated after signing more new subscribers.  The net loss of $27.7 million, or 23 cents a share,\ncompared with a loss of $19.6 million, or 17 cents, a year\nearlier, Alviso, California-based TiVo said yesterday in a\n statement . Analysts projected a 24-cent loss, the average of 12\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Cable operators are licensing TiVo technology for use in\nset-top boxes that connect to the Internet and access content\nfrom Netflix and others.  General Communication Inc. (GNCMA) , based in\nAnchorage,  Alaska , on Aug. 21 became the latest operator to\nadopt the TiVo platform for subscribers. Even in tough economic\ntimes, consumers are willing to pay for broadband services, Tom Rogers, TiVo\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview.  \u201cBroadband is one of those things that people are finding\nroom for in their budgets, and what TiVo does is bring the\nbenefits of broadband video to the television,\u201d Rogers said.  TiVo rose as much as 9.8 percent to $10.28 in extended\ntrading after results were announced. The  shares  fell 1.9\npercent to $9.36 yesterday in New York and have gained 4.3\npercent this year.  TiVo enrolled 253,000 new cable and satellite customers,\ncompared with a gain of 10,000 a year earlier. Revenue rose 6.6\npercent to $65.3 million in the period ended July 31.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the second-largest U.S. cable operator, will\nbegin offering TiVo service in  Sacramento , California; Portland,\nOregon; Denver and other markets this year, TiVo said.

This quarter, TiVo forecasts a loss of $27 million to $29\nmillion, as the company spends more in a patent lawsuit against\n Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  set to go to trial in October. That\nwas more than the $19.8 million loss  estimated  by analysts.  The company also said it expects to make progress toward\nbreakeven on a cash-flow basis as research spending declines and\nrevenue from cable systems increases in the latter part of the\nyear.
