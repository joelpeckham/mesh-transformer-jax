The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIndian stocks dropped for the first\ntime this week as some investors avoided taking fresh bets ahead\nof the corporate earnings season starting next week.  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the nation\u2019s second-biggest motorcycle\nmaker, and  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the largest mobile services\ncompany, paced decline among their peers. Infosys Ltd., the\nsecond-biggest software maker, will be the first company on the\nbenchmark  stock index  to report earnings on Jan. 12 for the\nthree months ended Dec. 31.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, fell 0.4 percent\nto 15,882.64 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai after moving\nbetween gains and losses at least 18 times. The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY) \nIndex on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. declined 0.3\npercent to 4,749.65. Both the gauges yesterday jumped the most\nsince Dec. 21.  \u201cWe don\u2019t expect significant moves before the earnings\nseason as the extent of damage to profits from slowing domestic\ndemand and Europe\u2019s crisis is not clear,\u201d K.K. Mital, a fund\nmanager at Globe Capital Market Ltd., said from  New Delhi .  Earnings forecasts for Sensex companies for the year to\nMarch 2012 have fallen 8.7 percent to 1,150 rupees per share,\nthe most since the year ended March 2009, according to about\n1,500 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

India \u2019s current-account deficit widened to near a record\nlast quarter, the central bank said on Dec. 30, as a weakening\nrupee made imports more expensive. The measure posted a $16.89\nbillion gap in the three months ended September. The rupee was\nAsia\u2019s worst-performing currency in 2011, lifting import prices\nin a country that buys 80 percent of its fuel from abroad.  Weak Rupee  \u201cIndia has a massive trade imbalance and that really\nexplains why the rupee has been as weak as it has,\u201d  Michael Shaoul , chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in  New York ,\nsaid on Bloomberg Television. \u201cWe would expect the Sensex to be\ndown significantly in 2012,\u201d he said, without forecasting a\nlevel for the index.

TVS Motor Co. shed 1.2 percent to 48.2 rupees.  \u201cWe have moderated our two-wheeler industry growth\nassumption from 12 percent to 7 percent\u201d for the year ending in\nMarch 2013, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts Jatin Chawla and\nAkshay Saxena wrote in a report today.  Stake Auction  State companies  Hindustan Copper Ltd. (HCP)  and  MMTC Ltd. (MMTC)  jumped\nafter India\u2019s market regulator yesterday allowed company owners\nto auction their stakes to investors instead of selling shares\nto the public.
