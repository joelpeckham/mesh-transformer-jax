 "context": "The following article called 'Bank of Israel Announces Stanley Fischer to Step Down' was published on 2013-01-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of  Israel  Governor  Stanley Fischer , credited by many economists for steering Israel through\nthe global financial crisis, said he will step down in the\nmiddle of his second term. Bonds, stocks and the shekel fell.  Fischer, 69, told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today\nof his plan to leave on June 30, the bank said in a statement.\nNo reason was given for his early departure. Zambian-born\nFischer took the helm in 2005 after earlier jobs as No. 2 at the\n International Monetary Fund  and vice-chairman at  Citigroup Inc. (C)   Replacing Fischer \u201cis a major problem for Netanyahu as\nStan has been a confidence-inspiring figure,\u201d said Nobel\neconomics laureate  Robert Solow , one of the governor\u2019s former\nteachers and colleague at the the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology. \u201cEveryone knows with Fischer nothing stupid was\ngoing to happen economically.\u201d  Fischer has shifted the bank\u2019s focus to employment and\ngrowth alongside  price stability . That\u2019s helped Israel\u2019s economy\nrebound from the global crisis faster than most of its peers.\nSince 2009, output has expanded by 14.7 percent, compared with\n10.7 percent in Australia and 3.2 percent in the U.S., according\nto the  finance ministry . Israel\u2019s main stock index has\noutperformed U.S. and European benchmarks in that period, adding\nmore than 80 percent.  Bond Yields  Bond yields on the 2023 Mimshal Shiklit benchmark bond rose\neight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 4.08 percent,\nthe highest since Dec. 4, at the close in Tel Aviv. The\nbenchmark  TA-25 (TA-25)  stock index closed 0.9 percent lower at 1,186.50\nand the shekel weakened 0.1 percent to 3.7293 a dollar at 7:13\np.m. in Tel Aviv.  A former economics professor at MIT, Fischer was U.S.\nFederal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke \u2019s thesis adviser. From\n1988 to 1990, he was chief economist at the Washington-based\n World Bank . At the IMF in the 1990s, he worked to resolve\nfinancial crises in  Mexico , Russia and Southeast Asia. From 2002\nto 2005, he was vice chairman of Citigroup.  In addition to his former student Bernanke, Fischer had\nclose ties with other central bankers. Bank of England Governor\n Mervyn King  said in a statement he has the \u201chighest\nadmiration\u201d for Fischer and called his resignation \u201ca loss to\nthe central banking community.\u201d  Kibbutz Stay  Fischer was approached in early 2005 by then-prime minister\nAriel Sharon and Netanyahu, serving as finance minister, to\nsucceed  David Klein  as central bank governor even though he\nwasn\u2019t an Israeli citizen or resident.  Fischer\u2019s connection with Israel dates back decades. He was\na member of Habonim, a Zionist youth group, along with Rhoda\nKeet, his future wife, with whom he has three sons. In the early\n1960s, he spent six months on a kibbutz on Israel\u2019s\nMediterranean coastal plain, where he combined learning Hebrew\nwith manual labor. He conducts his official business in Hebrew\nwith an accent that indicates his upbringing in southern  Africa .  In 2011 Fischer put himself forward as an candidate for the\nleadership of the IMF. He was disqualified for the post as he\nwas over the organization\u2019s age limit of 65, and the position\nwent to France\u2019s  Christine Lagarde .  Fischer\u2019s \u201cexperience, his wisdom and his international\nconnections opened a door to the economies of the world and\nassisted the Israeli economy in reaching many achievements,\nduring a period of global economic crisis,\u201d Netanyahu said in\nan e-mailed statement.  Governor Candidates  Fischer met Netanyahu at the prime minister\u2019s office after\nhis announcement and thanked him for the opportunity to run the\ncentral bank. \u201cOur rapid economic growth in the years I was\nhere was based on things enacted in prior years -- the\nstabilization program, reforms.\u201d  Replacing Fischer will present another challenge for\nNetanyahu as he works to form a new government following\nnational elections on Jan. 22, in which his Likud-Beitenu\nfaction won the most parliamentary seats. The prime minister had\ncalled early elections after his coalition failed to agree on a\nbudget for 2013.  \u201cThe timing is problematic on the back of elections,\u201d\nsaid Elah Alkalay, vice president for business development at\nIBI-Israel Brokerage & Investment Ltd.  Two possible candidates to replace Fischer may be Avi Ben- Bassat, former finance ministry director-general, and Zvi Eckstein, ex-Bank of Israel deputy-governor, said  Jonathan Katz ,\na Jerusalem-based economist for  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   Budget Cuts  Fischer said it was a priority for the next government to\nmake budget cuts in order to reduce the deficit. Israel posted a\nbudget deficit of 39 billion shekels ($10.43 billion) for 2012,\nor 4.2 percent of gross domestic product, more than double the\ngovernment target.  The Israeli economy \u201cis currently facing slow growth\nprospects and fiscal challenges and is in need of some\nstructural measures that require decisive action,\u201d said  Tevfik\nAksoy , chief economist for Central and Eastern Europe, the\n Middle East  and Africa at Morgan Stanley in London in a\nstatement. \u201cThe possible uncertainty regarding the future\nleadership of the Bank of Israel might hinder some of the\nrequired progress,\u201d Aksoy said.  Fischer said in his resignation statement that one of his\nprimary goals he had set for himself was passing a new Bank of\nIsrael law in 2010 that established a monetary committee to set\ninterest rates, rather than relying only on the governor. Some\nof Fischer\u2019s other innovations have been aimed at making the\nbank more transparent, such as publishing minutes of rates\nmeetings and holding quarterly sessions with economic\nforecasters.  Rate Surprises  \u201cHe has reformed the  Bank of Israel ,\u201d said Solow. The\ngovernor had turned the bank \u201cinto an exemplary central bank\nwith a decent research department and voice.\u201d  The Fischer-led Bank of Israel has surprised economists in\nabout a quarter of its rate decisions, more often than any other\nOrganisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country\nfor which comparable data is tracked by Bloomberg. Three of four\nrate cuts last year, the most recent on Dec. 24, weren\u2019t\nanticipated by the median forecast in Bloomberg surveys.
