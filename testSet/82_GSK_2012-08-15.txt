 "context": "The following article called 'Aspen Agrees to Buy Glaxo Products for 2.2 Billion Rand' was published on 2012-08-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) , the\nSouthern Hemisphere\u2019s largest generic drugmaker, agreed to buy\n25 pharmaceutical brands from U.K. partner  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) \nto bolster an Australian expansion.  Aspen will pay 2.2 billion rand ($268 million) for labels\nincluding Amoxil, Kapanol, Zantac and Lamactil, the\nJohannesburg-based manufacturer said in a statement today. The\npurchase will be funded from new\u00a0offshore\u00a0debt\u00a0facilities and\nwill boost earnings in the year ending June 2013, it said.  \u201cWhenever we can, we tend to use debt to fund deals as\nAspen is very cash generative, so it doesn\u2019t make sense to issue\nequity,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Stephen Saad said in an\ninterview in Johannesburg. \u201cOver time we can eliminate debt.\u201d\nThe company has secured an interest rate of 5 percent to 6\npercent, he said.  Aspen, which supplies medicines in more than 100 countries,\nis looking to increase business in Asia Pacific,  Latin America \nand sub-Saharan Africa, Saad said March 7. The transaction with\nLondon-based GlaxoSmithKline adds a range of antibiotic and\nanti-viral medicines as well as painkillers, muscle relaxants\nand treatments for nausea and inflammation.  Sigma\u2019s Purchase  The South African drugmaker completed the purchase last\nyear of Melbourne-based  Sigma Pharmaceuticals (SIP) , which allowed\nAspen to introduce its generic and over-the-counter products in\nAustralia and expand into countries including Japan, Taiwan,\nThailand and the Philippines.  \u201cWe already issue one in seven scripts in Australia and so\nthis deal means we can promote these brands without many\nadditional overhead costs,\u201d Saad said. Aspen can take brands\nthat haven\u2019t received attention from the previous owner, \u201cgive\nthem some care and make them work.\u201d  Fiscal first-half profit jumped 30 percent to 1.5 billion\nrand as sales in Australia,  Hong Kong ,  New Zealand  and the\nPhilippines tripled. Aspen is  scheduled  to release preliminary\nfull-year earnings on Sept. 12.  Aspen  fell  0.4 percent to 139.50 rand at the close in\nJohannesburg. The shares have gained 44 percent this year, the\nsecond-best performance on the six-stock  FTSE/JSE Africa Non-\nCyclical Consumer Goods Index. (JNCCG)   GlaxoSmithKline, the U.K.\u2019s largest drugmaker, owns 18.6\npercent of Aspen. BDO Corporate Finance (Pty) Ltd. found the\ntransaction between the companies to be fair to Aspen\nshareholders, the South African company said.
