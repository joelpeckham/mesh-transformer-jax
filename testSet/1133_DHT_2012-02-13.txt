 "context": "The following article called 'Iran Sanctions Tightening as OSG to Frontline Halt Shipping Nation\u2019s Crude' was published on 2012-02-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSanctions on  Iran  are tightening\nafter Overseas Shipholding Group Inc., Frontline Ltd. and owners\ncontrolling more than 100 supertankers said they would stop\nloading cargoes from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries\u2019 second-largest producer.  OSG, based in New York, said Feb. 10 that the pool of 45\nsupertankers from seven owners in which its carriers trade will\nno longer go to Iran. Four OSG-owned ships, managed by Tankers\nInternational LLC, called at the country\u2019s biggest crude-export\nterminal in the past year, ship-tracking data compiled by\nBloomberg show. Nova Tankers A/S and Frontline, with a combined\n93 vessels, said Feb. 9 and 11 they wouldn\u2019t ship Iranian crude.  Previous efforts to curb Iran\u2019s oil income and stop it from\ndeveloping nuclear weapons failed because the structure of the\nshipping industry means vessels are often managed by companies\noutside the U.S. or European Union. An EU embargo on Iranian  oil \nagreed to Jan. 23 extended the ban to ship insurance. With about\n95 percent of the tanker fleet insured under rules governed by\nEuropean law, there are fewer vessels able to load in Iran.  \u201cIt\u2019s the insurance that\u2019s completed the ban on trading\nwith Iran,\u201d said Per Mansson, a shipbroker for 31 years and\nmanaging director of Norocean Stockholm AB, which handles tanker\ncharters. \u201cLast summer, many countries started to be a little\nbit tougher, but the insurance is the real trigger.\u201d  Kharg Island  OSG\u2019s Overseas Rosalyn, which can carry about 2 million\nbarrels, arrived at Kharg Island on Jan. 27 and departed the\nnext day, tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show. It left\nabout 16 feet deeper in the water, an indication it loaded\ncargo. The vessel is managed by Tankers International, which has\nits head office in Cyprus. OSG complies with all U.S. and\nEuropean laws and its headquarters in New York doesn\u2019t manage\ncharters, OSG Chief Executive Officer Morten Arntzen said in an\ne-mail Jan. 30.  Tankers International told owners the pool\u2019s vessels will\nno longer sail to Iran after changes to EU regulations, Arntzen\nsaid in a Feb. 10 e-mail. Insurers are no longer able to cover\nvessels trading in the  Persian Gulf  nation, he wrote.  Ship owners sometimes group their vessels to coordinate\ncharters and improve earnings. The Tankers International pool\noperates 45 very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, from OSG and\nsix other companies, including Antwerp-based  Euronav NV (EURN)  and St.\nHelier, Channel Islands-based  DHT Holdings Inc. (DHT)   Nova Tankers  \u201cAll the owners in the pool have stated that they will not\ntrade Iran because of the consequences,\u201d DHT CEO Svein Moxnes Harfjeld said by phone Feb. 10. \u201cDHT is complying with all\nrelevant regulations and sanctions, and following recent\ndevelopments our vessels have been instructed not to trade\nIran.\u201d  Frontline companies including Hamilton, Bermuda-based\nFrontline Ltd. and Frontline 2012 won\u2019t ship Iranian crude, Jens Martin Jensen, chief executive officer of Frontline Management\nAS, said by e-mail and phone on Feb. 11 and 12. Frontline\noperates 43 VLCCs, according to its website.  Nova Tankers, the Copenhagen-based operator of a pool of\nships including vessels owned by Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., won\u2019t\nload Iranian crude because of European sanctions, Managing\nDirector Morten Pilnov said by phone from  Singapore  on Feb. 9.\nThe pool will have about 50 vessels by the end of this year,\naccording to data on its website.  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) , the second-largest owner of VLCCs, won\u2019t\ncarry Iranian oil if it means ships aren\u2019t insured, Yuji Isoda,\nan investor relations manager for the Tokyo-based company, said\nFeb. 9. The company doesn\u2019t yet know how its insurers will\nhandle the EU sanctions, he said by phone.  Tighter Restrictions  U.S. and EU leaders are trying to tighten restrictions on\nbusiness with Iran, which produced 3.55 million barrels of crude\na day in January, 11 percent of OPEC\u2019s total, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Oil sales earned Iran $73 billion in\n2010, accounting for about 50 percent of government revenue and\n80 percent of exports, the U.S. Energy Department estimates.  The  United Nations  has imposed four sets of sanctions on\nIran, and the  International Atomic Energy Agency  said in\nNovember the country had studied making an atomic bomb. The\ngovernment in Tehran says its nuclear program is for civilian\npurposes and that documents held by the IAEA purporting to show\ndesigns and tests of weapon components are fakes.  Iran has threatened to block  shipments  through the  Strait\nof Hormuz  in the Persian Gulf, through which about 20 percent of\nthe world\u2019s globally traded oil passes. Crude futures in  New\nYork  advanced 32 percent to $100.19 a barrel since Oct. 4.  Senate Bill  More trade with Iran may be blocked if a bill approved Feb.\n2 by the U.S. Senate Banking Committee becomes law, making U.S.\ncompanies responsible for the actions of their foreign units\nwhen dealing with Iran. A spokesman for committee chairman Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat, declined to comment.  While the Japanese government said last month it would curb\nimports from Iran,  India \u2019s Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai said\nJan. 17 his country wouldn\u2019t.  China , the Persian Gulf country\u2019s\nlargest customer, needs the oil for development, Vice Foreign\nMinister Zhai Jun told reporters Jan. 11.  Founded in 1948, OSG has 111  vessels  and 3,500 employees,\naccording to its website. Its biggest shareholders include the\nfamily of board members Oudi and Ariel Recanati, who control\nabout 10 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Oudi Recanati\nis an Israeli citizen and Ariel Recanati is a U.S. citizen,\naccording to a Sept. 6 filing with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission. Charles A. Fribourg sits on the board of OSG and\nContinental Grain Co., the data show.  Marshall Islands  Shares (OSG)  of OSG, which has 14 supertankers, fell 71 percent\nin the past year as a glut of vessels drove down transport\nrates. The company will report a loss of $178.6 million for this\nyear, down from $204.4 million for 2011, according to the median\nof five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Three other OSG vessels from the Tankers International pool\ncalled at Kharg Island in the past year, data compiled by\nBloomberg show. They fly the  Marshall Islands  flag, which means\nthey are registered there for regulatory purposes, according to\ndata on the website of International Registries Inc. Almost 9\npercent of the tanker fleet is flagged in the Marshall Islands,\nbehind Panama and Liberia, according to data compiled by London-\nbased  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world\u2019s biggest shipbroker.  \u201cShip owners and brokers are now seeing a tightening of\nsanctions,\u201d said  Bob Knight , managing director of tankers at\nClarkson in  London . \u201cThis is a sign that sanctions are starting\nto bite.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nIsaac Arnsdorf in London at \n iarnsdorf@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAlaric Nightingale at \n anightingal1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of DHT Holdings, Inc. was 6.723036766052246 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of DHT Holdings, Inc. was ",
