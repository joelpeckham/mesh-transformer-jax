 "context": "The following article called 'European Trading at Seven-Year Low as Hedge Demand Drops' was published on 2013-09-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOptions (SX5E)  trading on European shares\nis falling to a seven-year low as declines in equity volume\nreduce the need for investors to hedge.  About 858,600 contracts on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index changed\nhands each day on average this year, on track for the slowest\nyear since 2006, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Options\ntrading is down 22 percent from 2012 as the region\u2019s shares\nlagged behind equity-market gains in the U.S. and  Japan .  While  Europe  is emerging from the sovereign-debt crisis,\nthe longest-ever recession and rising joblessness in the region\nhas hurt  stock trading , with the gauge of the 50 biggest euro-area companies poised for its slowest year since 2005.\nRegulatory changes have made options trading less appealing,\naccording to  Andy Nybo , head of derivatives research at New\nYork-based Tabb Group LLC.  \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a great conviction on a strong European\nrally,\u201d said Alvise Munari, Morgan Stanley\u2019s global head of\nequity derivatives distribution and financial engineering in\n London . \u201cThere would have to be a catalyst, either a\u00a0correction\nor a significant acceleration of the feeling that there is a\nrecovery under way\u00a0for this to change.\u201d  The  European Central Bank  forecasts a 0.4 percent\ncontraction in the economy this year before the region returns\nto growth in 2014. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up 8.6 percent in 2013,\ncompared with an 18 percent surge in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\nIndex and 38 percent gain in the Topix.  Trading Volume  A daily average of  $15 billion  in shares have traded during\n2012 and 2013 in  Germany , the U.K. and  France , Europe\u2019s three\nlargest equity markets. That\u2019s the lowest level ever, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2003. The number of\nEuro Stoxx 50 shares changing hands has dropped 18 percent this\nyear to 715 million on average, according to the data compiled\nby Bloomberg.  The strength of the  U.S. economy  and its liquid markets are\ncausing global investors to prefer trading  stock options  on\nAmerican companies over European ones, Tabb\u2019s Nybo said. Trading\nof S&P 500 contracts has  jumped  17 percent to about 823,000 this\nyear, the most ever, data on average daily volume compiled by\nBloomberg show.  \u201cThe European economies are a little bit slower to emerge\nfrom this recession,\u201d Nybo said Sept. 9 by phone. \u201cThere\u2019s a\nlot of moving parts in Europe. There\u2019s a lot of different\nregulatory initiatives that impact how, why and where\nderivatives are traded.\u201d  Hedging Volatility  Mark Harris, who helps oversee $1.1 billion as a fund\nmanager at City Financial in London, said he\u2019s using options to\nprotect against volatility and potential equity losses. He said\nhe\u2019s looking for signs of strength in  China\u2019s economy  and more\ndetails on the  Federal Reserve \u2019s plan to reduce bond purchases\nbefore becoming more confident.  \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a correction for a long time,\u201d Harris\nsaid on Sept. 9. \u201cI\u2019m trying to hedge some of that volatility.\nI need more confidence on what policy will look like.\u201d  Executing an options trade is more expensive in Europe\nbecause there is no centralized clearinghouse for equity\nderivatives. Deutsche Boerse AG\u2019s Eurex and Liffe of NYSE\nEuronext are the two biggest equity-derivatives exchanges in\nEurope and both have their own separate clearinghouses. The\nChicago-based Options Clearing Corp. guarantees trades in U.S.\noptions and futures.  \u2018More Competitive\u2019  \u201cWe\u00a0have the OCC and central clearing in the U.S., so the\nfact that they are fungible also means the market is more\ncompetitive,\u201d  Eric Noll , who heads  Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc.\u2019s\ntransaction services in the U.S., said in a phone interview.\n\u201cThere is a concerted effort for the industry to\u00a0educate the\npublic, so over time that\u2019s had a substantial impact.\u201d  A total of 11 European Union states have agreed to a\nfinancial-transaction tax, known as the FTT. Stock and bond\ntrades would be taxed at a rate of 0.1 percent and derivatives\nat 0.01 percent with some exemptions for primary-market sales\nand trades with the ECB.  EU lawyers are clashing over whether the proposed tax is\nlegal under governing treaties. The final shape of the tax and\nthe way it will be imposed remain to be decided.  \u201cClearly, the FTT affected volumes,\u201d Alan Grigoletto,\nvice president of education for the Chicago-based Options\nIndustry Council, said in a phone interview. To have more\noptions trading in Europe, \u201cyou are going to have to see a\nreduction in the punitive taxes that have been placed on the\nfinancial community, and also education,\u201d he said.  European Growth  Nasdaq is betting equity derivatives will drive profit in\nEurope as greater transparency draws in more investors. The\nexchange operator bought a 25 percent stake last year in cash\nequity and equity derivatives trading venue The Order Machine,\nor TOM. The Dutch company said on Aug. 15 that it processed its\n10 millionth contract.  \u201cThere will be growth in Europe,\u201d Ed Provost, the\npresident of Chicago-based CBOE Holdings Inc., said in a phone\ninterview. \u201cIt\u2019s the second-most advanced area in terms of the\nuse of options. There is definitely demand.\u201d  The VStoxx Index, which measures the cost of Euro Stoxx 50\nderivatives, fell 4.6 percent to 18.43 yesterday, leaving it 5.5\npercent below the average for the past year. The gauge has\n slumped 21 percent  since reaching a two-month high on Aug. 30.\nIt gained 0.1 percent to 18.45 at 3:53 p.m. in  Frankfurt  today.\nIn the U.S., the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index\nof S&P 500 options prices climbed 1 percent to 13.96.  \u201cInvestors have gone out of equities and have not come\nback yet,\u201d Lex Van Dam, a  fund manager  who oversees $500\nmillion at Hampstead Capital LLP in London, said in a phone\ninterview yesterday. \u201cVolatility keeps going down. It is\ngetting to buy territory, but we\u2019re not buying.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nCecile Vannucci in London at \n cvannucci1@bloomberg.net ;\nAlexis Xydias in London at \n axydias@bloomberg.net ;\nNandini Sukumar in London at \n nsukumar@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nAndrew Rummer at \n arummer@bloomberg.net ;\nNick Baker at \n nbaker7@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CBOE Holdings, Inc. was 42.96906280517578 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CBOE Holdings, Inc. was ",
