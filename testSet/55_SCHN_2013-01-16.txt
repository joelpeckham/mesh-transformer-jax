 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Industrial Production Rises 0.3% on Equipment Demand' was published on 2013-01-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nProduction at U.S. factories climbed\nmore than forecast in December and the cost of living was little\nchanged, showing the economy gained momentum entering 2013 while\ninflation remained at bay.  Manufacturing output advanced 0.8 percent after jumping 1.3\npercent in November, the strongest back-to-back reading in\nalmost a year, Federal Reserve figures showed today. The Labor\nDepartment said its consumer-price index was unchanged last\nmonth, capping the third-smallest annual gain in a decade.  Rebounds in housing, the auto industry and business\ninvestment combined with stabilization in global growth will\nprobably support gains in manufacturing into this year. The lack\nof inflation and an improving job market are also helping boost\nAmericans\u2019 buying power, easing the risk that household spending\nwill slump as the budget battles in Washington shake confidence.  \u201cWe\u2019re likely to start this year on much firmer footing\nthan we did last year,\u201d said  Millan Mulraine , an economist at\nTD Securities LLC in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re moving in a positive\ndirection.\u201d  The Fed said today in its Beige Book business survey that\nthe economy picked up across much of the nation last month,\nboosted by sales of cars and homes.  \u201cEconomic activity has expanded since the previous Beige\nBook report, with all 12 districts characterizing the pace of\ngrowth as either modest or moderate,\u201d the central bank said in\nits survey, which is based on reports from the Fed\u2019s district\nbanks.  Stock Prices  Most stocks fell on concern about Europe\u2019s economy and\nafter the World Bank\u2019s downgrade of global growth. More than\nthree stocks dropped for every two advancing on U.S. exchanges\nas of 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average\nretreated 0.2 percent to 13,511.23 at the close. The Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,472.63.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2019s government today cut its\ngrowth forecast for Europe\u2019s biggest economy as austerity\npolicies in cash-strapped euro-region countries and cooling\nworld trade damp exports.  The Washington-based World Bank late yesterday projected\nthe global economy will expand 2.4 percent this year, down from\na June forecast of 3 percent, after growing 2.3 percent in 2012.  The Fed\u2019s production report showed total output, which\nincludes utilities and mining, increased 0.3 percent in\nDecember, restrained by the biggest plunge in electricity use in\nsix months as the weather turned unseasonably mild.  Consumer Spending  \u201cTo the extent that the performance of the manufacturing\nsector reflects pending consumption, it suggests sustained\nimprovement in consumer spending this quarter,\u201d said Mulraine,\nwho correctly projected the increase in total production.  Last month was the second-warmest December in U.S. records\ngoing back to 1958, according to the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration.  The median forecast of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg\nprojected total industrial production would rise 0.3 percent.\nEstimates ranged from a drop of 0.2 percent to an increase of\n0.6 percent.  The two-month increase in manufacturing output, which\naccounts for about 12 percent of the economy, was the biggest\nsince December 2011 and January 2012. It reflected in part a\nrebound from the damage caused by superstorm Sandy in October.  Production Breakdown  The report showed the influence of the auto industry and\nthe rebound in business investment and housing.  Output of business equipment rose 1.3 percent in December\nafter a 2 percent gain the prior month. Production of\nconstruction supplies advanced 1 percent.  The output of motor vehicles and parts increased 2.6\npercent after a 5.8 percent surge a month earlier.  Autos remain a source of demand, according to other\nreports.  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F) , the two largest\nautomakers by U.S. sales, topped analysts\u2019 estimates last month\nand forecast that industry deliveries will keep rising in 2013.\nCars and light trucks sold at a  15.3 million  annual pace in\nDecember after a 15.5 million rate in November, the best two\nmonths since early 2008, data from Ward\u2019s Automotive Group\nshowed.  Global Growth  A turnaround in foreign markets also will probably boost\noutput at American factories. Exports advanced 1 percent in\nNovember after declining the prior month.  Portland , Oregon-based\n Schnitzer Steel Industries Inc. (SCHN) , a steel recycler, is among\ncompanies watching for signs of better overseas sales.  \u201cThe global economic outlook remains challenging, but\nwe\u2019re cautiously optimistic that market conditions are modestly\nimproving,\u201d Tamara Lundgren, president and chief executive\nofficer, said on a Jan. 8 conference call. \u201c China  is clearly\nexhibiting stronger performance,\u201d and  Europe  is stabilizing.  China\u2019s exports jumped 14.1 percent in December from the\nsame month a year earlier, the biggest 12-month gain since May,\ncustoms administration data showed on Jan. 10. Among other data,\na broad measure of credit surged 28 percent from December 2011,\naccording to the central bank.  Another report today reinforced that housing in the U.S.,\nwhose slump precipitated the recession, is making a comeback.\nConfidence among U.S. homebuilders held in January at the\nhighest level in more than six years, according to data from the\nNational Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo. The group\u2019s\nsentiment index was 47, matching December\u2019s reading as the\nhighest since April 2006.  Inflations Ebbs  Growing demand is not spurring inflation. The unchanged\nreading in the consumer-price index matched the median estimate\nof 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and followed a 0.3\npercent drop the prior month, Labor Department data showed.\nCosts rose 1.7 percent in 2012, down from a 3 percent increase\nin 2011. Consumer prices rose 2.4 percent on average annually\nover the past decade.  Price increases will probably remain restrained as\nretailers including  Target Corp. (TGT)  use discounts to attract\ncustomers and budget battles in Washington hurt confidence.\nFederal Reserve policy makers are likely to maintain\nunprecedented easing measures while inflation holds below their\ntarget level and absent further progress on reducing\njoblessness.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about on the inflation front\u201d\nso the Fed will continue easing measures, said Bricklin Dwyer,\nan economist at BNP Paribas in New York, who correctly projected\nthe December price reading.  Price Measure  The Fed\u2019s preferred price measure, which is tied to\nconsumer spending patterns, rose 1.4 percent in the 12 months to\nNovember, according to data from the Commerce Department.  Central bankers in December adopted a more flexible\napproach to their interest-rate outlook, saying borrowing costs\nwill stay low \u201cat least as long\u201d as unemployment remains above\n6.5 percent and if the Fed predicts inflation of no more than\n2.5 percent one or two years in the future. That language\nreplaced an earlier link between the rate outlook and calendar\ndates. Unemployment was 7.8 percent in December and November.  The consumer-price report showed energy costs decreased 1.2\npercent in December as gasoline fell 2.3 percent.  Fuel costs so far this year have held near a 2012 low\nreached in December. A gallon of regular gasoline at the pump\n dropped  to a $3.29 average on Jan. 15, close to the $3.22\nreached on Dec. 19 that was the lowest in a year, according to\nAAA, the biggest U.S. auto group.  Lower fuel prices will help Americans\u2019 buying power even as\nhigher taxes restrain their discretionary spending. The fiscal\npact passed by Congress on Jan. 1 allowed the payroll tax used\nto pay for Social Security benefits to return to the 2010 level\nof 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent. That reduces the paycheck by\nabout $83 a month for someone who earns $50,000.  A separate report from the Labor Department today showed\nwages adjusted for inflation climbed 0.3 percent on average in\nDecember after increasing 0.6 percent the prior month. For all\nof 2012, they were up 0.3 percent after falling 1 percent the\nprior year.
