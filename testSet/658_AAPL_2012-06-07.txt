(GOOG)  is upgrading mapping\nservices to woo users and swipe back at  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , which is\nnudging aside the location tools on its own mobile devices.  Apple plans to unveil a mapping application next week that\nwill come pre-installed on its iPhones and iPad tablets,\nreplacing Google Maps, said a person with knowledge of the\nmatter who isn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about it.  Google, whose mapping app has been on the iPhone since its\nunveiling in 2007, today announced a feature that gives users\naccess to maps even when they\u2019re offline. The feature initially\nis only available on devices using Google\u2019s Android software.  \u201cI\u2019m very proud of Google Maps services and they\u2019re\navailable basically on all devices today,\u201d Brian McClendon,\nvice president of engineering for  Google Maps , said at an event\ntoday in  San Francisco . \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to make Google Maps\nservices as widely available as possible.\u201d  Google and Apple have increasingly clashed as the two\ncompanies compete for users of mobile devices and related\nservices, such as music and movies. Google\u2019s Android operating\nsystem has emerged as the most widely used smartphone software,\nand will command 61 percent of the market this year, while\nApple\u2019s iOS will rank second, with 20.5 percent this year,\naccording to IDC.  With the new mapping option, users can select a portion of\na map when the device is online that can later be used when the\ndevice is no longer connected to the Web, Rita Chen, product\nmanager for Google Maps for Mobile, said today at the event.  Street View Upgrades  The company offered the service as an experimental feature\nfor Android last year.  \u201cThis has been one of the most requested features, and is\ncoming soon,\u201d Chen said.  McClendon said an Apple version of the service could be\nadded in the future.  Google also  announced  improvements for Street View, which\nfeatures photos of roads and byways around the world.  The company, which has mainly relied on people in autos to\ncapture the images, said today that it will incorporate images\ntaken with other devices. Google photographers will begin using\nbackpack-like machines to take pictures of more obscure places -\n- say, castles or ancient ruins.  In another upgrade, Google said it added more detail to the\nsatellite images that are part of its Earth for Mobile tools.\nThe service will give more nuanced and accurate images for\nplaces as varied as highways and baseball parks.  Map services are part of Google\u2019s effort to widen its lead\nas the largest U.S. provider of online mapping. Google had 75.1\nmillion map users in April, up 29 percent from a year earlier.\nThat put it ahead of MapQuest, which had a 7 percent decline,\nand  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) \u2019s Bing, which had 8.59 million, a 10 percent\ngain, according to  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)  Google generates sales of\nadvertisements that appear on map-search results.
