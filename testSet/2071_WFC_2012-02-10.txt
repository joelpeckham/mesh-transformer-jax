 "context": "The following article called 'Foreclosure Settlement, Libor Probe, EBA\u2019s \u2018Boost,\u2019 Takeda: Compliance' was published on 2012-02-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of America Corp. (BAC) , JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and three other U.S. banks reached a $25 billion\nsettlement with 49 states and the federal government to end a\nprobe of abusive foreclosure practices stemming from the\ncollapse of the housing bubble.  In what the U.S. called the largest federal-state civil\nsettlement in the nation\u2019s history, the banks have committed $20\nbillion in various forms of mortgage relief plus payments of $5\nbillion to state and federal governments.  \u201cThere are something like 10 million-plus homes under\nwater to the tune of half a trillion dollars,\u201d said Lynn\nTurner, the former chief accounting officer at the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and a managing director at consulting\nfirm Litinomics Inc. in Los Angeles. \u201cI don\u2019t think this\nsettlement, which lets all the bank executives off the hook for\nfiling false documents with courts, is going to make much of a\ndent.\u201d  The accord announced yesterday in  Washington  was 16 months\nin the making, following a move by states to investigate bank\nforeclosure practices in 2010. The deal will \u201cbegin to turn the\npage on an era of recklessness\u201d that led to the housing bubble,\nPresident  Barack Obama  said in Washington, where he was joined\nby administration officials and state attorneys general.  The nation\u2019s five largest mortgage servicers -- Bank of\nAmerica, JPMorgan,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , Citigroup Inc. and Ally\nFinancial Inc. -- negotiated the settlement with federal\nagencies, including the Justice Department, and state attorneys\ngeneral.  The deal comes more than a year after attorneys general\nfrom all 50 states announced a probe into foreclosure practices\nfollowing disclosures that banks were using faulty documents to\nseize homes.  Oklahoma reached a separate agreement worth $18.6 million\nwith the banks and didn\u2019t sign the federal settlement, according\nto a statement from the state\u2019s attorney general, Scott Pruitt.  The $25 billion agreement includes $1.5 billion in payments\nto some 750,000 borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure.\nAbout $17 billion will pay for mortgage debt forgiveness,\nforbearance, short sales and other assistance to homeowners.\nServicers will also provide $3 billion in refinancing to lower\nhomeowners\u2019 interest rates. A website has been set up to give\ninformation on the settlement.  For more, click here.  Compliance Policy  EU Agrees on Clearing Law for Over-the-Counter Derivatives  European (BEBANKS)  Union officials and lawmakers brokered a deal on\nrules to force trading of some over-the-counter derivatives\nthrough clearinghouses to safeguard financial markets.  The law, approved after negotiations in Brussels yesterday,\nwill empower EU regulators to decide on types of derivatives\nthat should be centrally cleared. Traders who flout the rules\nwould face penalties including fines. The law also sets rules on\nmanagement of clearinghouses, including on reserves they must\nhold to protect themselves from insolvency.  Global regulators have sought tougher rules for OTC\nderivatives since the collapse in 2008 of  Lehman Brothers\nHoldings Inc. (LEHMQ)  and the rescue of  American International Group\nInc. (AIG) , two of the largest traders in credit-default swaps.\nLawmakers have said that clearing firms should also face  tougher\nregulation  because a crisis at one of them could threaten the\nglobal financial system.  Negotiators on the EU rules sought to address concerns from\nU.S. banks that they could face discrimination.  U.S.-based companies  warned  last year that a draft of the\nlaw would grant exemptions from clearing rules to derivatives\ntrades between different units of the same bank, but only if\nthese units were both based in  Europe .  The accord would empower ESMA to settle disagreements\nbetween national supervisors on whether a clearinghouse should\nbe authorized.  For more, click here.  EU Banks to Boost Capital by $130 Billion, Regulator Says  European banks plan to boost capital by about 98 billion\neuros ($130 billion), 26 percent more than regulators originally\nrequired, while excluding lenders in  Greece  and those in the\nmidst of restructuring.  The  European Banking Authority  also said in an e-mailed\nstatement it won\u2019t subject banks to stress tests on their\nbalance sheets this year, citing the current efforts to raise\ncapital. The measures would result in banks reducing lending to\nthe real economy by \u201cless than 1 percent of the total amount\u201d\nof capital raised, the EBA said.  The agency excluded all Greek banks,  Dexia SA (DEXB) , Austria\u2019s\n Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  and  Germany \u2019s  WestLB AG (WESTLB)  from the\nmost recent calculations because they are restructuring their\nbusinesses or already under obligations tied to receiving money\nfrom the  International Monetary Fund .  The EBA told European banks to raise 114.7 billion euros in\nfresh capital in December to respond to the sharp drop in the\nvalue of securities issued by euro-area governments. The agency\nalso required banks to keep a core Tier-1 capital ratio of 9\npercent and hold additional reserves, called a sovereign buffer.  Banks submitted plans to raise capital in January. The EBA\nhas said lenders aren\u2019t allowed to reduce lending to reach the\ncapital-ratio goals. Groups of financial supervisors will have\nfurther meetings on the plans this month.  Canadian Securities Regulators Streamline Rules on ETFs  Canadian  Securities Administrators  introduced amendments\nstreamlining access to market for exchange traded funds by\neliminating need to apply for regulatory exemptions, according\nto a  statement  on the regulator\u2019s website.  The amendments come into force April 30 after ministerial\napproval. The purpose of the reform is to reduce regulatory\ncosts, which the CSA anticipates will benefit investors, the\nregulator said in the statement. The CSA also expects the new\namendments to make the funds more resilient to certain short-\nterm risks by introducing liquidity restrictions, the CSA said\nin the statement.  SEC Backs Away on Real-Time Data in Market-Tracking System  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Mary\nSchapiro  is backing away from a proposal to require live\nreporting of trading data as part of the agency\u2019s planned\nmarket-surveillance system.  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, said yesterday in a\nstatement that Schapiro believes, based on comments received by\nthe agency, that \u201cvery substantial benefits\u201d of a consolidated\naudit trail can be achieved without incurring the costs and\nrisks of real-time reporting.  Schapiro hasn\u2019t scheduled a vote on the audit trail, which\nthe SEC says would help track the cause of disruptions such as\nthe May 6, 2010, market plunge that temporarily erased $862\nbillion in equity value before stocks recovered by day\u2019s end.  Later that month, the SEC proposed building the audit trail\n-- a multibillion-dollar centralized data hub that would capture\n\u201ccustomer and order event information\u201d as it happens. The\nreal-time reporting idea was faulted by the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority, as well as brokerages and exchanges that\nexpressed concern over the plan\u2019s cost, which the SEC initially\nestimated at $4 billion to build and $2.1 billion a year to\nmaintain.  The SEC currently keeps tabs on the markets using data\nterminals from private industry. Senate Republicans sent a\nletter to Schapiro last month asking why the SEC was pursuing a\nreal-time audit trail instead of a cheaper alternative proposed\nby Finra.

Courts  SIPC Ordered to Say Why It Shouldn\u2019t Cover Stanford Victims  The  Securities Investor Protection Corp.  was ordered by a\nfederal judge to explain why it shouldn\u2019t begin a claims process\nfor the victims of R. Allen Stanford\u2019s alleged investment fraud.  U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins in Washington yesterday\nruled that SIPC, a nonprofit corporation funded by the brokerage\nindustry, must tell the court by Feb. 16 why it shouldn\u2019t be\nordered to start a liquidation proceeding in federal court in\nTexas to handle more than $1 billion in possible claims related\nto the alleged Stanford fraud.  At issue is whether more than 7,000 brokerage customers who\ninvested in the alleged $7 billion Ponzi scheme run by Stanford\nare entitled to have their losses covered by SIPC. The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission sued SIPC in December to\ncompel coverage.  Wilkins said he will decide whether SIPC must file an\napplication for a protective decree in federal court in Texas.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.\nSecurities Investor Protection Corp., 11-mc-00678, U.S. District\nCourt, District of Columbia (Washington).  U.S. Drops Antitrust Lawsuit Against Deutsche Boerse, NYSE  The U.S. Justice Department said it dismissed an antitrust\nlawsuit and proposed settlement agreement with  Deutsche Boerse\nAG (DB1)  and  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  because the two exchange owners have given\nup on their proposed merger.  The lawsuit and settlement are \u201cno longer necessary since\nthe parties have formally abandoned their plans to merge,\u201d the\nJustice Department said in a statement yesterday.  Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext terminated their merger\nagreement Feb. 2, a day after European antitrust regulators\nblocked the transaction because it would have concentrated too\nmuch derivatives trading in the hands of a single entity.  Ex-Takeda Executive Committed Insider Trading, SEC Claims  A former  Takeda Pharmaceutical International Inc. (4502)  executive\nwas accused of using inside information to make more than\n$63,000 trading in call options, according a lawsuit filed by\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Brent Bankosky, a former director in Takeda\u2019s business\ndevelopment group, used non-public information to trade in\nadvance of Takeda\u2019s announcement of transactions involving  Cell\nGenesys Inc. (CEGE)  and  Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (3437127Q) , the SEC said\nin a civil complaint filed yesterday in Manhattan federal court.  Bankosky also used information about confidential\ndiscussions between Takeda and two other drug companies, Arena\nPharmaceutical Inc. and AMAG Pharmaceutical Inc., according to\nthe agency. Bankosky failed to profit from his trades in those\ncompanies\u2019 securities, the SEC said.  Bankosky has agreed to a partial settlement of the suit\nwithout admitting or denying the SEC allegations, said his\nlawyer, Robert Heim. Bankosky will contest the SEC request for\nan order barring him from acting as an officer or director of a\npublic company, Heim said.
