The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAristotle Onassis\u2019s only surviving\ndescendant is providing a boost to  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) \u2019s cargo\nunit with a regular contract to transport dozens of show jumping\nhorses to Brazil at a cost of as much as $1.3 million.  Athina Onassis de Miranda , the main heir to her shipping\nmagnate grandfather, funds the transfer of horses to Rio de\nJaneiro for a tournament she helped set up and which bears her\nname, said Axel Heitmann, head of Lufthansa\u2019s animal-cargo unit.  \u201cOnce a year she invites the community to her big event,\u201d\nHeitmann said in an interview. In total, Lufthansa transports\nabout 2,000 horses a year in what has become a \u201cvery profitable\nbusiness,\u201d since the size and bulk of a consignment determines\nthe price, he said at the company\u2019s Frankfurt Animal Lounge.  Flying one horse across the Atlantic can cost 10,000 euros\n($13,000), as much as a first-class return for a two-legged\npassenger, and as many as 100 attend the South American event,\nHeitmann said. While animal transport contributes 2 percent of\nLufthansa\u2019s annual freight revenue, the market is less volatile\nthan the cyclical cargo business and helps stabilize earnings.  Lufthansa\u2019s South American legs are among the longest flown\nwith horses, with Frankfurt-Sao Paolo and Frankfurt-Buenos Aires\ntaking 12 hours. Animals headed to the Americas from the Middle\nEast also pause in  Europe  because the distances would otherwise\nbe too great, while some originating in Asia go via the longer\nwestbound route because of the level of service, Heitmann said.  Amsterdam Appeal  About 24,000 horses travel by air each year, with Lufthansa\nranked second in the market globally behind  Air France-KLM\nGroup (AF) , which moves about 12,000, aided by its so-called  Animal\nHotel  in Amsterdam, according to spokesman Jean-Claude Raynaud.  Cargolux Airlines International SA is also a major player,\nwith other competitors including  FedEx Corp. (FDX) , Dubai-based\nEmirates,  El Al Israel Airlines (ELAL)  Ltd. and  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)   Athina Onassis moved to Brazil after her 2005 marriage to\n Alvaro Affonso de Miranda Neto , a two-time Olympic bronze medal\nwinner, establishing the show jumping event two years later.  Transport and accommodation for the world\u2019s top 30 horses\nand riders is ultimately funded by sponsors, as is the practice\nfor all events awarded five-star status under a ranking system\napproved by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports,\naccording to Alice Furtado, a spokeswoman for Onassis.  Coca-Cola, Petrobras  Current backers include Coca-Cola Co.,  Procter & Gamble\nCo. (PG) , watchmaker Longines, the Brazilian government,  Petroleo\nBrasileiro SA (PETR4)  -- or Petrobras -- and phone company  Oi SA. (OIBR4)   \u201cThe main reason the event exists is that Brazil --despite\nhaving an Olympic equestrian champion and two bronze medals for\nteams -- didn\u2019t have a five-star event,\u201d Furtado said \u201cThe\nidea is to bring the country closer to the sport.\u201d  The Athina Onassis Horse Show began as part of the Global\nChampions Tour, a show-jumping circuit founded by Olympic gold\nmedal winner  Jan Tops  in 2006 that\u2019s among the most lucrative in\na sport known to attract European and Arabian royals and U.S.\nsocialites including Bruce Springsteen\u2019s daughter Jessica.  While the GCT will make its London debut this summer at an\nevent organized by Peter Phillips, Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s eldest\ngrandchild, Onassis\u2019s Brazilian contest has been an independent\nsince 2012 and will this year take place in October.  French-born Onassis was raised in Switzerland, where  Bilanz \nestimated in 2011 she was worth 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2\nbillion), making her the country\u2019s youngest billionaire. The\nmagazine removed her from the ranking after the move to  Brazil ,\nand Furtado said Onassis had no comment on her wealth.  Lizards, Fish  The 28-year-old is the only child of the late Christina\nOnassis, whose brother Alexander died without any offspring.\nAristotle Onassis\u2019s second marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, widow\nof the assassinated U.S. president, was childless.  Onassis, herself an accomplished rider, and her Brazilian\nhusband have won prize money in GCT competitions totaling $1.3\nmillion since 2006, according to its  website . Edwina Tops-\nAlexander, wife of the founder, leads the tally on $3 million.  Lufthansa transports 110 million creatures a year in total,\nranging from lizards and tropical fish through cats and dogs to\nfarm and zoo animals. The Cologne-based company has ordered 24\nboxes from Van Riemsdijk Rotterdam BV able to hold three horses\napiece, which it helped develop. The containers fold for loading\nin the bellies of passenger planes, where pets usually travel.  The busiest routes include those to and from the U.S.,\nBeijing,  Singapore  and Dubai, Sharjah and Qatar in the Gulf.  Private clients must use specialist shipping agents such as\nindustry leader Peden Bloodstock of the U.K., which handles\nimport procedures and health documentation and provides so-\ncalled flying grooms who care for animals during transport.  \u201cDemand is continuously climbing as the sport enthuses\nmore and more people, especially in Asia,\u201d said Isabelle Atock,\na senior consultant at Peden, which transports horse for the\nOlympics and most major championships, including the Onassis\nshow in Rio, according to its website.
