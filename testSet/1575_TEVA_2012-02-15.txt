 "context": "The following article called 'Teva Fourth-Quarter Profit Rises 23% on Cephalon Acquisition' was published on 2012-02-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) \nsaid fourth-quarter profit rose 23 percent as last year\u2019s\nacquisition of Cephalon Inc. shifted the company further away\nfrom its original identity as a generic-drug maker.  Earnings excluding some costs climbed to $1.4 billion, or\n$1.59 a share, from $1.1 billion, or $1.25, a year earlier, the\nPetach Tikva, Israel-based company said in a statement today.\nProfit matched the average estimate of $1.59 a share from 25\nanalysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Teva, the world\u2019s biggest maker of copied medicines, bought\nFrazer, Pennsylvania-based Cephalon for $6.5 billion last year\nin a bid to broaden a portfolio of brand-name drugs that has\nbeen dominated by the multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone. In\nMay, Teva will replace Chief Executive Officer  Shlomo Yanai  with\nJeremy Levin, a  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  executive known for\noverseeing the U.S. drugmaker\u2019s \u201cstring of pearls\u201d strategy of\nsmall acquisitions and partnerships.  \u201cI hope that in May he knows exactly what he wants to do\nbecause he doesn\u2019t have time to waste,\u201d Gilad Alper, a Tel\nAviv-based analyst for Excellence Nessuah Brokerage, said in a\ntelephone interview today. \u201cWhatever Levin wants to do, he\u2019ll\nneed a lot of money. He needs the goodwill of lenders, and that\nwill decline rather quickly if Copaxone market share declines.\u201d  Pipeline  Teva has a strong pipeline of branded drugs, Yanai said at\na press conference in Tel Aviv today. The company is in\n\u201cadvanced talks\u201d with U.S.  Food and Drug Administration \nofficials to craft a study to enable it to win approval for\nmultiple sclerosis pill laquinimod, he said. The drug failed in\none trial last year and yielded disappointing results in a\nsecond.  \u201cI am optimistic about the continued growth of Teva in the\nbranded products sector,\u201d Yanai said.  Teva repeated the target it issued in December, saying\nearnings excluding some costs this year will be $5.48 to $5.68 a\nshare, while revenue will reach about $22 billion. The company\nsaid in December it may not meet its long-term target of $31\nbillion in sales by 2015, which Yanai described then as an\n\u201caspirational goal.\u201d  Teva rose 2.4 percent to 167.80 shekels in  Tel Aviv . The\ncompany\u2019s American depositary receipts gained 3.5 percent to\n$45.04, the biggest gain in six weeks. Teva\u2019s ADRs lost 15\npercent in the past year before today, including reinvested\ndividends,  compared with  a 17 percent return for the Bloomberg\nEurope Pharmaceutical Index.  Narcolepsy  Sales rose 28 percent to $5.7 billion, as revenue from\nbrand-name medicines soared 68 percent to $2.3 billion with the\ninclusion of Cephalon\u2019s products. Sales of generic drugs in the\nU.S. fell 5 percent to $1.2 billion. The company said it plans\nto introduce new treatments that will generate $650 million in\nsales this year.  Cephalon\u2019s top-selling drug, Provigil, loses patent\nprotection in April, Natali Gotlieb, a Tel Aviv-based analyst\nfor Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd., said in a telephone\ninterview today. The narcolepsy treatment had sales of $350\nmillion in the fourth quarter.  \u201cEveryone already has 2012 in their mind,\u201d Gotlieb said.  Teva and U.S. partner  BioSante Pharmaceuticals Inc. (BPAX)  won\nU.S. clearance to sell Bio-T-Gel, a testosterone-replacement\ntherapy for men, the Food and Drug Administration said late\nyesterday. BioSante estimates the U.S. market for male\ntestosterone products exceeds $1.2 billion.  Copaxone Peak  Fourth-quarter revenue from Copaxone, which faces\ncompetition from newer treatments, increased 11 percent to $927\nmillion. Teva said sales will probably be more than $3.8 billion\nthis year.  The company reported profit that doesn\u2019t meet generally\naccepted accounting principles because it excludes costs linked\nto acquisitions such as Cephalon. On a net income basis, Teva\nearned $506 million in the quarter, 34 percent less than the\n$771 million in the year-ago period.  Teva increased its quarterly  dividend  25 percent to 1\nshekel a share.
