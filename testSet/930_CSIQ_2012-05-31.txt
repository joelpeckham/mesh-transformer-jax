The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWestinghouse Solar Inc. (WEST)  and  Zep Solar\nInc.  said they have settled a patent dispute over designs to\nreduce the cost of attaching solar panels to roofs.  Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed. The settlement, which\ncovers civil suits and a case pending before the U.S.\nInternational Trade Commission in  Washington , extends to all\ncustomers, suppliers and licensees of the companies, they said\nin a joint statement.  Westinghouse Solar had accused Zep of infringing patents\nrelated to ways to reduce the amount of hardware and labor\nneeded to install solar panels. The companies were vying to have\ntheir designs adopted by more installers to take advantage of\nthe increased popularity of the $8.4 billion U.S.  market  for\nsolar energy in homes and businesses.  Reducing installation costs is important because they have\nremained stable even as the price of solar panels dropped. That\nhas created a barrier for some homeowners even with tax breaks,\nthe Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group based in\nWashington, has said.  Westinghouse, formerly Akeena Solar Inc., sought to ban\nU.S. imports of  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)  panels, mainly made by the\nKitchener, Ontario-based company in  China  using the Zep design.\nThe Westinghouse Solar design, known as Andalay, is used by\n Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)   The dispute dates to 2009, when Westinghouse Solar sued Zep\nin federal court. It filed the ITC case in October.  The case before the commission is In the Matter of Certain\nIntegrated Solar Power Systems, 337-811, U.S. International\nTrade Commission (Washington). The civil cases are Akeena Solar\nInc. v. Zep Solar Inc., 09cv5040, and Zep Solar Inc. v.\nWestinghouse Solar Inc., 11cv3800, both U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of  California  ( San Jose ).
