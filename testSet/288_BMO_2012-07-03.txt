The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Canadian dollar touched a six-\nweek high against its U.S. counterpart as oil, the nation\u2019s\nlargest export, climbed amid speculation central banks in  Europe \nand  China  may add monetary stimulus.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, rallied versus\nmost of its 16 major peers as the  European Central Bank  is\nforecast to cut interest rates this week. A state-owned\nnewspaper in China said the time is ripe for a reduction in\nbanks\u2019 reserve-requirement ratios, which would indicate monetary\nstimulus. Stocks rallied, indicating increased demand for\nriskier assets.  \u201cCommodity currencies have been buoyed by expectations\ncentral banks around the globe will offer some stimulus measures\nto prop up growth after we\u2019ve seen a run of disappointing\nnumbers to begin the week,\u201d said Joe Manimbo, a market analyst\nin Washington at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of\n Western Union Co.

A U.S. government report this week is projected to show\nemployers added fewer than 100,000 workers for a third month in\nJune. U.S. payrolls added 90,000 workers last month after a\n69,000 gain in May, a Bloomberg survey showed before the Labor\nDepartment data on July 6.  \u201cIt\u2019s a function of how much the numbers come in above or\nbelow expectations,\u201d said  Shane Enright , as executive director\nin Toronto at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\u2019s CIBC World\nMarkets unit.. \u201cI would imagine you\u2019d see a little bit of a\ncorrection here if the Canadian and U.S. numbers came in on the\nsofter side.\u201d  Risk Demand  Canada\u2019s dollar rose along with other risk-sensitive\ncurrencies, tracking the 17-nation euro higher, as European\nUnion PresidentHerman Van Rompuy said leaders meeting in\nBrussels June 28-29 agreed to drop the condition that emergency\nloans to Spanish banks give creditor governments preferred\nstatus.  \u201cThe Canadian dollar benefited from the EU announcement\nlast week when it appeared that some concrete action is going to\nbe taken with respect to the European banks,\u201d said Blake Jespersen, managing director of foreign exchange in Toronto at\n Bank of Montreal. (BMO)  \u201cI think it\u2019s a good start and certainly the\nmarket has embraced that initial announcement, but I think\nthere\u2019s a lot more work to be done, so I would not be surprised\nif there\u2019s some speed bumps along the way.\u201d  ECB officials will lower their  main interest rate  by a\nquarter percentage point to a record 0.75 percent on July 5, a\nBloomberg News survey of economists shows.
