 "context": "The following article called 'Reckitt Benckiser to Bid for Schiff in $1.4 Billion Deal' was published on 2012-11-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nReckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/)  made a\nsurprise $1.4 billion counterbid for  Schiff Nutrition\nInternational Inc. (SHF) , topping an agreed offer from  Bayer AG (BAYN)  for\nthe maker of vitamins, supplements and nutrition bars.  The tender offer of $42 a share in cash will commence\ntoday, Slough, England-based Reckitt Benckiser said yesterday\nafter U.S. markets closed. The bid is 24 percent higher than\nSalt Lake City-based Schiff\u2019s last  closing price .  Reckitt Benckiser and Bayer are competing for Schiff\u2019s\nfast-growing vitamins and nutritional supplements business,\nwhich the German drugmaker had sought to add to its consumer-\nhealth unit. Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer agreed last month\nto buy Schiff for about $1.1 billion.  \u201cThis is not a done deal,\u201d  Andrew Wood , an analyst at\nSanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note today. \u201cThere is\ncertainly a possibility that Bayer may announce a counterbid to\nRB\u2019s offer, even though it would require Bayer eating its words\nthat its current bid is already above what it considered as\nexceptionally fully valued.\u201d  Bayer is holding meetings today to assess the situation and\nevaluate next steps, according to three people close to the\ncompany who declined to be identified because the deliberations\nare private. No final decision has been made on whether it will\nmake a counterbid or walk away, the people said.  Bayer declined to comment on Reckitt\u2019s offer, said Michael Schade, a spokesman for the Leverkusen, Germany-based company.  \u2018Significant Synergies\u2019  Schiff rose as much as 30 percent to $44.19 in extended\ntrading yesterday, exceeding Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s bid price. The\nshares rose less than 1 percent to $33.92 at the close in  New\nYork . Reckitt Benckiser fell 1 percent to 3,715 pence at 8:03\na.m. in London, while Bayer rose 0.3 percent to 65.65 euros.  Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Strepsil cold remedies and\nGaviscon heartburn relief, said a purchase of Schiff wouldn\u2019t be\ndependent on financing because it could be funded from existing\nfacilities. Buying Schiff would result in \u201csignificant\nsynergies and that it would be immediately accretive to earnings\non an adjusted basis,\u201d it said.  \u201cIf Reckitt Benckiser is successful with this bid, we\nbelieve this acquisition makes excellent strategic sense and\ngood financial sense,\u201d Bernstein\u2019s Wood wrote.  The U.K. company\u2019s offer may draw interest in Schiff from\nother global consumer-health companies, Wood said, identifying\n Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  as the only other major player that doesn\u2019t\nhave a position in the area of vitamins and dietary supplements.  Bidding War?  There have been almost 170 takeovers of vitamin and\nnutrition products companies globally in the past decade,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s\noffer values Schiff at about 28 times earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization. That compares with the\nmedian of 18 times Ebitda in a survey of 13 similar deals over\nthat period, Bloomberg data show.  \u201cThe deal is not cheap, but the multiples still seem\nreasonable,\u201d Wood said. Reckitt Benckiser could justify paying\nan even higher price if forced into a bidding war, he said.  The British company said it sees no reason why its tender\noffer for Schiff cannot close before the end of the year,\n\u201cassuming prompt due diligence.\u201d The offer is subject to the\ntermination of Schiff\u2019s agreement with Bayer.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  is Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s exclusive financial\nadviser and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is\ngiving legal advice. Reckitt Benckiser said it will file offer\ndocuments today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The company said it\u2019s prepared to sign a merger agreement\n\u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the one Schiff has with Bayer and\n\u201clooks forward to engaging with Schiff\u2019s board and is confident\nthat they will recognize it as a superior proposal.\u201d  Tiger\u2019s Milk  Schiff, whose Chief Executive Officer Tarang Amin would\nhave received a $5 million bonus if the Bayer deal was completed\nby Dec. 31, may have to pay Bayer a $22 million breakup fee,\naccording to a filing from the company in October.  Bayer\u2019s Oct. 29 agreement with Schiff allows the U.S.\ncompany to accept an unsolicited higher offer within 30 days,\nprovided it pays Bayer the breakup fee.  Schiff makes Move Free joint-care pills, Tiger\u2019s Milk\nnutrition bars and MegaRed Omega-3 supplements. The company had\nsales of $258.9 million in the year ended May 31, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. Schiff gets 94 percent of  revenue \nfrom the U.S., and has been \u201cconsistently gaining share in the\nU.S. vitamins market over the last two years,\u201d Bernstein said.  Beating Estimates  Reckitt Benckiser last month posted revenue that beat\nestimates, boosted by increased sales of health-related products\nand a turnaround in developed markets. Chief Executive Officer\nRakesh Kapoor has introduced new products such as Durex\nPerformax Intense condoms and boosted marketing spending to stem\ndeclines in slumping European markets while lifting sales in\nemerging regions.  Harold Thompson , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in London,\nsaid Reckitt Benckiser has been successful at extracting higher\nprofits from a string of acquisitions since 2006, including\nAdams Respiratory Therapeutics Inc. and SSL International Plc,\nthe maker of Scholl foot products and Durex condoms.  \u201cEach deal has come at a healthy price and this one is no\ndifferent,\u201d said Thompson in an e-mailed note. \u201cThe growth and\nmargin improvement which have been promised with each deal have\nalways come through and more.\u201d said Thompson, who recommends\nbuying Reckitt Benckiser stock.  Reckitt Benckiser bought Chester, New Jersey-based Adams\nfor $2.14 billion in 2008 and paid 2.5 billion pounds ($4\nbillion) in 2010 for London-based SSL.  Becky Herrick, a spokeswoman for Schiff, didn\u2019t immediately\nreturn a voicemail after regular business hours yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:\nDuane D.
