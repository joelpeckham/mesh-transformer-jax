 "context": "The following article called 'Corzine May Face CFTC Lawsuit Over MF Global, NYT Reports' was published on 2013-06-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFormer MF Global Holdings Ltd.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Jon S. Corzine may soon\nface a lawsuit from U.S. regulators over the brokerage\u2019s\ncollapse, the  New York  Times reported.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal\nagency that regulated the firm until its bankruptcy in 2011, is\nset to approve a lawsuit as soon as this week, the newspaper\nsaid, citing unidentified law enforcement officials. Corzine,\nthe former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., could face\nmillions of dollars in fines and a ban from trading commodities\nif he is found liable, the newspaper reported.  The agency has informed Corzine\u2019s lawyers that it plans to\nfile the case without giving him an opportunity to settle, which\nmay result in a protracted legal fight, the Times said. The suit\nagainst Corzine, 66, would be another blow to the Wall Street\nveteran, once a senator and governor of  New Jersey .  \u201cThe CFTC apparently intends to bring what would be an\nunprecedented and meritless civil enforcement action against Mr.\nCorzine,\u201d Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for the former governor,\nsaid in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThe CFTC has not alleged that\nMr. Corzine engaged in any wrongdoing or directed anyone to\nengage in any wrongdoing with regard to customer funds.\u201d  Steve Adamske , a CFTC spokesman, didn\u2019t immediately respond\nto a request for comment outside of normal business hours.  Client Funds  The commission will probably blame the CEO for not\npreventing MF Global\u2019s misuse of customer money, without\ndirectly linking him to the disappearance of more than $1\nbillion in client funds in the firm\u2019s final days, the newspaper\nsaid, citing the officials.  Corzine spent 24 years at Goldman Sachs, rising to become\nco-head of the firm with  Henry Paulson , who later became\nTreasury secretary. Corzine left Goldman Sachs in 1999 with an\nestimated $400 million as the firm went public. He then turned\nto politics, winning election to the Senate in 2000.  After five years in  Washington , he became New Jersey\u2019s\ngovernor in 2006 until his November 2009 loss to Republican\n Chris Christie  in the governor\u2019s race. Corzine was named\nchairman and CEO of MF Global in March 2010, remaking the\nfutures brokerage into a smaller version of an investment bank.  \u201cIt\u2019s a huge fall from grace,\u201d Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., said by telephone.\n\u201cIn a certain sense, he is already tainted because his company\nfailed.\u201d  Porous Controls  Following almost two years of gathering evidence, criminal\ninvestigators concluded that porous risk controls at the firm,\nrather than fraud, allowed the customer money to disappear, the\nnewspaper said, citing the law enforcement officials with\nknowledge of the case.  The commission hasn\u2019t told other top MF Global executives\nthat they will be sued, the Times reported, citing lawyers\nbriefed on the case. The CFTC is more likely to focus on lower-level employees in charge of protecting customer accounts, the\nnewspaper said.  \u201cIn essence, the CFTC intends to allege that Mr. Corzine\nwas negligent in failing to supervise experienced professionals\nwho were in MF Global\u2019s back office in  Chicago  and who did not\nreport to Mr. Corzine,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThis allegation is\nnothing more than another example of Monday morning\nquarterbacking and is without any factual or legal basis.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJames Gunsalus in Tokyo at \n jgunsalus@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChitra Somayaji at \n csomayaji@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of New York Times Company (The) was 9.574031829833984 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of New York Times Company (The) was ",
