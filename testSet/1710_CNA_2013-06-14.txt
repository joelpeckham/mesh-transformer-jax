 "context": "The following article called 'U.K. Power Price to Double German on Wind, Solar: Energy Markets' was published on 2013-06-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nElectricity in the U.K. is poised to\ncost almost twice as much as in  Germany  within two years as\nBritain lags behind in building solar and wind plants.  U.K. power will be 85 percent more expensive than in\n Europe \u2019s biggest energy market in May 2015, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an average  premium  of\n17 percent over the past five years and 80 percent today, data\nfrom Marex Spectron Group Ltd., a broker in  London , show.  While Germany is seeking to consolidate its status as\nEurope\u2019s biggest producer of wind and solar power by boosting\nits share of renewables-sourced energy to 35 percent in 2015\nfrom 22 percent last year, the U.K. is targeting 15 percent from\n11 percent over the same period. Statkraft AS is closing money-losing gas-fed plants in Germany, while  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  and\nVitol SA are buying British power stations, betting on gains of\nas much as 19 percent in U.K. prices by 2016, according to\nSociete Generale SA.  \u201cThe U.K. has built significantly less renewables to\ndate,\u201d Ilesh Patel, a partner at Baringa Partners LLP, a\nconsulting firm that counts EON SE and  Electricite de France SA (EDF) \namong its clients, said in a phone interview from London.\n\u201cGermany has been on a fast-track wind and solar plan.\u201d  U.K. power will cost 53.16 pounds ($83.12) a megawatt-hour\nin May 2015, compared with 33.21 euros ($44.21) in Germany,\naccording to fair value calculations on Bloomberg as of 12:47\np.m. in London. The British  premium  has averaged 8.51 euros over\nthe past five years, 21.49 in 2013 and was at 24.48 euros today,\nMarex Spectron data show.  Consumers Pay  The gap may widen in coming years, according to  Societe\nGenerale . German next-year power will cost 39.70 euros a\nmegawatt-hour in 2015, 6 percent less than the average during\nthe first three months of 2013, as U.K. prices rise 11 percent\nto 59.40 pounds, Paolo Coghe, an analyst for the bank in Paris,\nsaid in a June 12 report.  \u201cHigh generation levels from zero variable-cost\ntechnologies, such as solar photovoltaic and wind, are damping\nGerman power prices and hurting plant revenues by reducing the\namount of time a plant might otherwise be called upon to\noperate,\u201d Coghe said.  The lower German prices are no comfort for the 40 million\nhouseholds in Europe\u2019s biggest economy. Retail prices have risen\n17 percent since the end of 2009, according to Eurostat data\ncompiled by Bloomberg Industries. The nation has the highest\nresidential costs in Europe after  Denmark  as utilities pass on\nthe costs of solar and wind generation, Jonathan Lane, head of\nconsulting for power and utilities at GlobalData, a London-based\nresearcher, said by phone on June 12.  \u2018Warning Signal\u2019  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2019s government should take\nsteps to contain the cost of the switch to renewables as\nhouseholds have so far borne the brunt through power bills\ninflated by renewable-power subsidies while industrial users\nhave been shielded from the increased costs, the  International\nEnergy Agency  said last month.  \u201cThe fact that German electricity prices are among the\nhighest in Europe, despite relatively low wholesale prices, must\nserve as a warning signal,\u201d Maria van der Hoeven, the Paris-based adviser\u2019s executive director, said May 24.  U.K. rates have risen more steeply than Germany\u2019s since\n2011, according to Eurostat. The cost of meeting renewables\ntargets has contributed to rising bills,  Centrica Plc (CNA) , Britain\u2019s\nbiggest residential energy supplier, said in its full-year\nresults on Feb. 27. The company has more than doubled prices\nsince 2004, according to data compiled by uSwitch, a London-based consumer group.  Plant Closures  Environmental policies such as feed-in tariffs and\nrenewables-obligation certificates accounted for 9.4 percent of\nCentrica\u2019s U.K. consumer rates last year. The Windsor, England-based utility said in October the policies would add an extra 40\npounds in 2013 after it raised average household prices by 6\npercent, or 80 pounds a year.  U.K. electricity margins, the amount of spare generation\ncapacity available at times of peak demand, may fall to 4\npercent in 2015 from 14 percent, the U.K.\u2019s Office for Gas and\nElectricity Markets, said in October. Coal-fed generation,\nincluding EON\u2019s Kingsnorth plant and  RWE AG (RWE) \u2019s Didcot-A unit have\nclosed earlier than the 2015 deadline under the EU\u2019s Large\nCombustion Plant Directive.  Statkraft,  Norway \u2019s biggest utility, will mothball its 510-megawatt Landesbergen gas-fed plant in Germany from July 1, the\ncompany said on June 6. The Oslo-based company shut its Emden\nplant last year.  Macquarie,  Australia \u2019s largest investment bank, bought the\n540-megawatt Baglan Bay and 819-megawatt Sutton Bridge gas-fed\npower stations in the U.K., the Sydney-based company said in\nJanuary. Vitol, based in Geneva, bought the 1,220-megawatt\nImmingham plant, it said May 10.  Improving Outlook  \u201cThe outlook for gas generation in the U.K. is set to\nimprove over the next five years,\u201d Brian Potskowski, an analyst\nin London at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said June 12 by\nphone. \u201cWe will continue to see interest in assets.\u201d  Profit from burning the fuel has dropped for three years\nand closed at minus 56 pence a megawatt-hour yesterday,\naccording to Bloomberg calculations based on next-month power\nand gas costs and emissions prices.  Britain is encouraging renewable energy by setting a floor\nprice for emissions costs, making it more costly to run fossil\nfuel-powered stations. The U.K. makes utilities pay about 18.08\npounds per metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted for the year\nthrough March 2016, the Treasury said in its March 20 budget.\nThat\u2019s in addition to a European carbon credit price of 4.92\neuros a ton for December 2015 on the ICE Futures Europe\nexchange.  \u2018Very Profitable\u2019  The floor price will help keep power costs high relative to\ncontinental Europe and boost baseload, or round-the-clock\nimports,  James Cox , a principal consultant at Poeyry Oyj, a\nHelsinki-based adviser to governments and utilities, said May 8\nby phone.  \u201cIn three to four years you would expect interconnectors\nto be importing baseload into the U.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going\nto be a very profitable time for anyone that has a power cable\nfrom the U.K. to anywhere else.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nRachel Morison in London at \n rmorison@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nLars Paulsson at \n lpaulsson@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CNA Financial Corporation was 18.428714752197266 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CNA Financial Corporation was ",
