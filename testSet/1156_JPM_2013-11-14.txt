 "context": "The following article called 'JPMorgan Gets Map to Descend FSB Surcharge Plateau With HSBC' was published on 2013-11-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGlobal regulators this week put\n JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  at the pinnacle of a\nlist of 29 too-big-to-fail banks that face tougher capital rules\nthan other lenders. The companies were also handed a map to plot\ntheir descent.  For the first time since it started compiling a roster of\nlenders whose collapse would threaten the global economy, the\n Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  also disclosed the\nthresholds for how it determined the level of extra capital\nrequirements that such banks should face. The move will enable\nlenders to find ways to move down to a lower surcharge category\nor exit the list altogether.  The capital surcharges for globally systemic lenders add an\nextra layer of safety beyond beefed-up standards known as Basel\nIII that emerged in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman\nBrothers Holdings Inc. Regulators said the additional buffers\nwere vital to protect taxpayers and prevent crises from\ncascading through the financial system.  \u201cI think the Basel committee would be quite happy in this\ninstance for banks to change their scores by becoming smaller,\nless interconnected, less complex,\u201d said  Patricia Jackson , head\nof prudential advisory at Ernst & Young LLP in  London . \u201cIt\u2019s\nalso a shot across the bows in the sense that if they become\nmore complex, larger, relative to others they go up the list.\u201d  Basel III  The Basel committee is the architect of Basel III, which\nwould more than triple minimum rules on the core equity that\nbanks should have to absorb losses. It also devised the list of\nsystemic banks for the Financial Stability Board, which brings\ntogether regulators and central bankers from the Group of 20\nnations.  It uses a combination of measures to decide which banks\nshould be included on the list -- and what capital surcharge\nthey should face. Regulators take into account lenders\u2019\ninterconnectedness, their size, complexity, global reach, and\nthe ability of other firms to take over their functions should\nthey fail.  The extra requirements are set in half-percentage-point\nincrements ranging from 1 percent of a bank\u2019s risk-weighted\nassets to 2.5 percent.  On top of tougher capital requirements, banks on the FSB\nlist also face greater oversight of their risk management and\ninternal controls.  Loss Absorbency  The new data should enable banks to work out \u201ctheir\nend-2012 scores and see their positions within the buckets that,\nin future exercises, will determine their higher loss absorbency\nrequirement,\u201d the committee said in a statement on its website,\nin reference to the list. The information adds to details of the\ngeneral methodology for calculating the surcharges, which was\nalready public.  Spokesmen for JPMorgan and HSBC in London declined to\ncomment.  Greater transparency \u201ccan help banks move in the direction\nregulators wish,\u201d Huw van Steenis, head of European banking\nanalysis at  Morgan Stanley (MS) , in London, said in an e-mail.  Still, national rules and stress tests are \u201clargely\ntrumping\u201d the FSB requirements, by forcing banks to hold even\nmore capital, said van Steenis, whose employer is among the 29\nlisted banks and currently faces a 1.5 percentage point\nsurcharge.  Banks and regulators have clashed over the economic\nconsequences of forcing lenders to boost their capital,\npresenting competing assessments of the impact on growth.  Competing Estimates  The Basel committee estimated in 2010 that Basel III would\ntrim global economic growth by a \u201cmodest\u201d 0.22 percent over\nits implementation period. The banking industry has presented\nestimates that are  several multiples  higher.  Banks can boost their  capital ratios  in several ways,\nincluding by issuing ordinary shares and other instruments that\ncount as capital, as well as by selling off assets or scaling\nback lending.  The largest global banks cut the shortfall in the reserves\nthey\u2019ll need to meet Basel capital rules, including the FSB\nsurcharges, by 82.9 billion euros ($111 billion) in the second\nhalf of 2012, leaving a gap of 115 billion euros at the end of\nlast year, according to data published by regulators in\nSeptember. European banks accounted for 70.4 billion euros of\nthe end-2012 shortfall.  Since the list system was devised in 2011, European and\nU.S. regulators have taken independent steps to toughen rules\nfor their banks. The European Banking Authority requires some\nlenders to meet  capital requirements  equivalent to 9 percent of\ntheir risk-weighted assets.  Capital Clamor  Banks in the bloc also stand to face stress tests and asset\nquality reviews by the EBA and  European Central Bank . In the\nU.S., regulators have indicated that some banks may have to meet\nleverage and liquidity rules that in some ways go beyond what is\nforeseen by Basel.  The clamor to meet other targets may make the capital\nsurcharges \u201cless of an issue,\u201d said Jackson. And banks on the\nlower rungs may feel there is some security in being on the\nlist, she said.  \u201cThere are certainly some banks who thought they were\nbetter off being included, so that investors see them as too-big-to-fail. At the same time, they probably don\u2019t want to be\none of the highest.\u201d  Lower Ranking  One complication for lenders seeking a lower ranking on the\nlist is that banks\u2019 systemic importance is measured relative to\nother lenders.  \u201cIf a bank reduces its size and interconnectedness, but\nthe whole group does as well, then the bank\u2019s score will not\nchange,\u201d said Jackson.  The surcharges will be gradually phased in from 2016, and\nwill be initially based on next year\u2019s version of the list, to\nbe calculated using data from the end of this year.  \u201cThere should come a day\u201d when the FSB list is blank,\nStephen Cecchetti, head of the monetary and economic department\nat the  Bank for International Settlements , said last year.\n\u201cThat day will come when either the institutions change, the\nrules change, or both.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJim Brunsden in Brussels at \n jbrunsden@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAnthony Aarons at \n aaarons@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 43.255088806152344 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
