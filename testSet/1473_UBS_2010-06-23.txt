 "context": "The following article called 'Asia Millionaires Match Europe for First Time, Merrill Says' was published on 2010-06-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAsia-Pacific\u2019s number of\nmillionaires equaled Europe\u2019s for the first time last year as\nthe region powered the global economy\u2019s recovery, according to a\nreport by  Capgemini SA  and  Merrill Lynch & Co .  \n The number of individuals with at least $1 million of\ninvestable assets in Asia-Pacific rose 26 percent to 3 million\nin 2009, matching Europe and almost overhauling North America\u2019s\n3.1 million, according to the 14th annual World Wealth Report\npublished yesterday.  \n Asia \u201ccontinues to lead the global economic recovery and\nthis has benefited many of the markets in the region in terms of\nboth growth and wealth creation,\u201d  Ong Yeng Fang , market\nmanaging director for Indonesia, Philippines and Thailand at\nMerrill Lynch Wealth Management, said at a conference in\nSingapore today. Given Europe\u2019s debt crisis, \u201cthere is a very\nhigh possibility that their numbers will be surpassed.\u201d  \n Millionaires in Asia-Pacific -- home to 60 percent of the\nworld\u2019s population and the two fastest-growing major economies -\n- boosted combined assets 31 percent to $9.7 trillion, the\nfastest regional increase, according to the survey. The MSCI\nAsia-Pacific Index posted its  biggest annual gain  in six years\nas stimulus spending in China reignited economic growth.  \n Barclays Plc, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG are rushing to\nexpand their private banks in Asia-Pacific as rich people from\nIndonesia to China invest more money. Wealth in the region,\nexcluding Japan, is expected to rise at almost double the global\npace, the Boston Consulting Group said this month.  \n \u201cThis region has the best economic growth, the highest\nlevels of wealth creation, and many players are coming to this\npart of the world, or are expanding,\u201d  Charles Mak , Morgan\nStanley\u2019s head of private wealth management, said in an\ninterview this month.  \n Global Wealth  \n The number of millionaire households, or those with at\nleast $1 million in investable assets excluding primary\nresidences, expanded to 10 million globally from 8.6 million a\nyear earlier, according to Merrill Lynch and Capgemini. North\nAmerica\u2019s number of millionaires grew 17 percent, the second-\nbiggest regional increase.  \n Worldwide, global wealth held by millionaires rose by 19\npercent to $39 trillion after falling more than 19 percent in\n2008 following the credit crisis that sent stock indexes to\ntheir worst annual losses since the Great Depression and slashed\nthe value of real-estate holdings, hedge-fund and private-equity\ninvestments.  \n Assets in North America advanced 18 percent in 2009 to\n$10.7 trillion. The U.S. had 2.87 million millionaires, followed\nby 1.65 million in Japan and 861,500 in Germany, the report said.\nThe three countries accounted for 53.5 percent of the world\u2019s\nmillionaires in 2009. The number of millionaires in Hong Kong\nsoared 104 percent and in India, 51 percent to 126,700.  \n \u2018More Cautious\u2019  \n \u201cHigh-net-worth investors have emerged more cautious and\nconservative, but they have emerged,\u201d  Lyle LaMothe , head of U.S.\nwealth management for Merrill Lynch global wealth management,\nsaid in New York.  \n Last year\u2019s gains were driven by market recovery and\ngovernment stimulus efforts, the survey said. The  Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index  rose more than 20 percent in 2009 after falling\n38 percent in 2008, its steepest annual drop since 1937.  \n Ultra-high-net-worth individuals with more than $30 million\nto invest saw their wealth rise by almost 22 percent in 2009,\nfaster than other millionaires, according to the report, which\nattributed the gain to a \u201cmore effective re-allocation of\nassets.\u201d  \n Allocations  \n Millionaire investors \u201cwarily returned to markets in\ncautious pursuit of returns,\u201d LaMothe said. Equity holdings\nworldwide rose to 29 percent from 25 percent and fixed-income\ninvestments increased to 31 percent from 29 percent as cash and\ndeposits dipped to 17 percent from 21 percent.  \n Portfolio allocations to real estate stayed the same at 18\npercent as residential real estate assets\u2019 increase balanced out\ncommercial real estate holdings\u2019 decrease.  \n Wealthy investors in all regions except Latin America\nincreased their relative share of holdings in markets outside\ntheir home regions, reversing a trend that began in 2006 of\nincreasing investments in home countries.  \n \u201cWhat the markets and economy destroyed in 2008 was\nreconstructed in 2009,\u201d  Patrick Ramsey , chief executive officer\nof Merrill Lynch Bank (Suisse) SA, told reporters in Zurich.\n\u201cVolatility is now part of our world, and we have to learn to\nlive with it.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Joyce Koh  in Singapore at \n jkoh38@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     A gold fountain stands at the entrance of a residential housing estate in central Beijing.
