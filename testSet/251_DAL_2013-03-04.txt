The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDoug Parker, poised to run the\nworld\u2019s biggest carrier after the pending merger of  US Airways\nGroup Inc. (LCC)  and  American Airlines (AAMRQ) , said consolidation will create\na stronger industry able to provide returns to investors.  The airline formed in the American- US Airways  combination\nwill have a broad enough network to compete with larger rivals\n United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ,\nParker, now US Airways\u2019 chief executive officer, said today in\nan interview set to air on Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cStreet\nSmart\u201d with  Adam Johnson .  Putting American and US Airways together will leave just\nthree major U.S. carriers with domestic and international\nroutes, down from seven in 2000. The merger, announced on Feb.\n14, will close as American exits bankruptcy protection in this\nyear\u2019s third quarter.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t an industry that\u2019s ever been able to meet its\nreturn on capital,\u201d said Parker, 51. \u201cInvestors are demanding\nthat and we need to go do it. We have the structure we need to\ngo do that and have a very competitive industry that could also\nprovide returns to investors. We are committed to doing that.\u201d  While the  Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index (BUSAIRL)  surged 40 percent\nin the 12 months that ended March 1, investors also have been\nbattered in recent years by airline losses and bankruptcies. The\nindex tumbled 53 percent from the end of 2006 through 2009, more\nthan twice the 21 percent drop for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\nIndex.  Bankruptcies, Mergers  United and Delta were among the carriers restructuring in\ncourt last decade, setting the stage for mergers that vaulted\nthem past American into the top spots in the global industry by\npassenger traffic.  American, the third-biggest U.S. carrier, and No. 5 US\nAirways are assembling a transition team from both companies\nthat will focus on how to integrate operations, Parker said.  The combination still must win approval from AMR\u2019s\nbankruptcy judge, shareholders of Tempe, Arizona-based US\nAirways and federal regulators. The merged airline will keep\nAmerican\u2019s name and its Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters and\nretain all seven hubs.  \u201cThey fit together perfectly,\u201d Parker said. \u201cWe have a\nvery strong East Coast presence where American had a hole, and\nwe fill that hole very capably.\u201d  Annual savings and new  revenue  from the merger should total\nmore than $1 billion by 2015, the airlines said. US Airways also\nwill spend about $400 million to bring its employees up to\nAmerican\u2019s pay rates.
