 "context": "The following article called 'Investors Doubt `Currency War' as Bets Rise for Gains' was published on 2010-09-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInvestors are stepping up bets that\npolicy makers from Brazil to South Korea will fail in their\nefforts to stem the fastest appreciation of emerging-market\ncurrencies in more than a year.  Options traders are paying the lowest rate in five months\nfor the right to sell the Brazilian real, South African rand,\nSouth Korean won and Indonesian rupiah rather than buy them,\nbased on the so-called risk reversal rate. Expectations of\nsudden depreciations in the four currencies reached the lowest\nlevel yesterday relative to the yen, euro and pound since a\nrecord decline in May, based on a measure derived from three-\nmonth dollar options known as implied volatility.  Developing nations are bearing the brunt of desires by\ngovernments in the world\u2019s biggest economies to weaken their\ncurrencies as the recovery falters. Brazil\u2019s Finance Minister\n Guido Mantega  warned this week of a global \u201ccurrency war\u201d as\nhis government weighs a higher tax on capital inflows. South\nAfrica central bank Governor  Gill Marcus  said Sept. 22 she\u2019s in\ndiscussions with \u201cmany countries to see what the solution is.\u201d  \u201cThe risk of capital controls being imposed is\nincreasing,\u201d said  Bhanu Baweja , the global head of emerging-\nmarket foreign-exchange strategy in London at UBS AG, the\nsecond-largest currency trader. \u201cCentral banks in emerging\nmarkets are going to become less tolerant of currency\nappreciation as the global trade cycle slows.\u201d  Slower Growth  Developing-nation currencies climbed 6.1 percent against\nthe dollar this quarter, the biggest advance since the second\nquarter of 2009, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Emerging\nMarkets Currency Index , as investors sought to benefit from the\nfastest economic growth rates and reap higher returns than are\navailable in developed countries.  Speculation is increasing that policy makers will take\nsteps to slow appreciation as the International Monetary Fund\nscales back global economic growth forecasts.  John Lipsky , the\nNo. 2 official at the IMF, said in the text of a Sept. 27 speech\nposted on the Washington-based fund\u2019s website that the second-\nhalf global expansion will fall short of its forecast for a 3.75\npercent annual rate. Standard & Poor\u2019s said this week that\ngrowth prospects for the Group of 20 nations are \u201clackluster.\u201d  Japan broke a six-year policy this month by selling yen,\njoining countries across Asia and Latin America that have sought\nto temper gains in their currencies against the dollar.  Fund managers are plowing $575 billion a year into\nemerging-market assets, 20 percent more than the previous record\nset before the global financial crisis, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nsaid in a Sept. 10 report.  Higher Rates  Benchmark borrowing costs of 10.75 percent in Brazil, 6\npercent in South Africa and 6.5 percent in Indonesia compare\nwith between zero and 0.25 percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent\nin Japan, increasing the allure of developing-nation bonds.  The  IMF  predicts developing economies will grow by 6.8\npercent in 2010, more than twice the 2.6 percent pace in the\ndeveloped world.  Demand for options granting investors the right to sell the\nrand versus those giving the right to buy suggests the gains may\npersist. The rand\u2019s three-month risk reversal rate was minus\n3.25 percent yesterday, the lowest since April and compared with\nminus 5.2 percent at the end of August. When negative, the\nmeasure means demand for options giving the right to sell the\ncurrency is greater than demand for those that allow purchases.  Volatility  Expected fluctuations on the real, rupiah, rand and won\nreached the lowest level this week since a record decline on May\n4 relative to the outlook for the yen, euro and pound. There was\nno difference between the implied volatility of the emerging and\ndeveloped nation currencies on Sept. 29, down from 5.6 percent\non May 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The real and rand each have risen 35 percent against the\ndollar since the beginning of 2008, the biggest advancers in\nemerging markets. The currencies are climbing even as central\nbankers step up dollar purchases to try to weaken exchange\nrates.  Brazil\u2019s central bank bought $5.9 billion in the first 12\ndays of September, the most in 11 months, according to  Altamir Lopes , the head of the bank\u2019s economic department. South\nAfrica\u2019s Reserve Bank incurred a loss of 1.05 billion rand ($151\nmillion) in the year through March due to the cost of building\nforeign currency reserves to stem rand gains, according to its\nannual report released on Sept. 22.  \u2018Hot Money\u2019  Most central banks will prefer to increase purchases of\ndollars rather than impose capital controls, said  Drausio Giacomelli , the head of emerging markets strategy at Deutsche\nBank AG, the world\u2019s biggest currency trader. Limits on\ninvesting may make it difficult for countries that need to\nborrow, he said.  \u201cIf you impose capital controls, who\u2019s going to buy your\nbonds?\u201d Giacomelli said in a phone interview from New York. \u201cI\nwould first wait for a surge of speculative hot money to see\nthat kind of extreme reaction.\u201d  Robin Brooks , a senior foreign exchange strategist at\nGoldman Sachs, said in a Sept. 10 report that investor\nexpectations that emerging-market currencies will keep rallying\nmay be misplaced.  \u201cSome emerging markets have already resorted to capital\ncontrols, and the risk of further such measures remains,\u201d\nBrooks said.  South Africa  South Africa\u2019s governing African National Congress debated\na proposal to tax capital inflows at a conference last week. The\ngovernment isn\u2019t going to impose a tax on bond and share\npurchases in the near future despite calls from within the\ngoverning party to do so, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said\nin a Sept. 16 interview. Policy makers will first look at the\nexperience of countries that have made similar moves, including\nBrazil, Gordhan said.  The rand has rallied 6.4 percent against the dollar this\nyear as foreign investors bought 100.8 billion rand of South\nAfrican stocks and bonds, the biggest inflow since 1995 when the\ncountry abolished foreign-exchange controls, according to data\nas of Sept. 20 from JSE Ltd., the company that runs the nation\u2019s\nexchanges. Net purchases for all of 2009 were 102 billion rand,\nthe data show.  South Africa\u2019s economy expanded an annualized 3.2 percent\nin the second quarter, down from 4.6 percent in the first three\nmonths of the year, according to Statistics South Africa.  \u2018Closely Watching\u2019  South Korea tightened limits on banks\u2019 holdings of currency\nforwards, which are used for speculating on future foreign-\nexchange swings or protecting against losses, to 250 percent of\nequity capital in June. Since then the won has gained 7 percent\nagainst the dollar. The government will be \u201cclosely watching\u201d\nthe market and will take measures when \u201cexceptional\u201d movements\noccur,  Kim Yi Tae , director of foreign exchange at the Finance\nMinistry, said on Sept. 9.  The won advanced about 10 percent from this year\u2019s low on\nMay 26. Export growth may slow in the next quarter as the\nstrengthening won makes the country\u2019s goods less competitive\nabroad,  Cho Hwan Eik , president of the Korea Trade-Investment\nPromotion Agency, said in an interview in Seoul on Aug. 31.\nExports helped fuel 7.6 percent economic growth in the first\nhalf of the year, Cho said.  Indonesia\u2019s central bank said in June it will require\ninvestors in one-month bills to hold the securities for at least\nfour weeks. The rupiah has since appreciated 2.6 percent and is\nup 5.3 percent this year. Indonesia\u2019s foreign currency holdings\nhave jumped 29 percent over the past year to $75 billion.  Mantega, the 61-year-old Brazilian finance minister, said\nSept. 15 the Treasury has \u201cunlimited resources\u201d to step up\ndollar purchases and won\u2019t \u201close this game.\u201d  Bond Tax  Brazil\u2019s real has stayed within 20 centavos of a two-year\nhigh against the dollar since the government set a 2 percent tax\non foreign purchases of local securities on Oct. 19 last year\nand is up 2.3 percent in 2010 after a 33 percent rally in 2009.  Mantega told reporters in Brasilia this week that the\ngovernment doesn\u2019t plan to increase the tax on capital inflows\n\u201cat this time.\u201d Central bank President  Henrique Meirelles  said\nthat Brazil was considering higher inflow taxes as other\ncountries adopt policies to weaken their currencies.  \u201cWe should have a balanced global economy,\u201d Meirelles,\n65, told reporters in London on Sept. 28. \u201cWe can\u2019t have some\ncountries having their currencies weakened. Evidently, we\u2019re\ngoing to have a few countries paying the price for that.\u201d  The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation\nyesterday prodding China to raise the value of the yuan. The\nbill would let American companies petition for punitive tariffs\non Chinese imports to compensate for the effects of what some\nlawmakers say is an artificially weak yuan, said Representative\n Chris Van Hollen . The Senate may take up its version of the\nlegislation after the Nov. 2 election.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said this month\nthat the Obama administration will use every available tool to\nurge China to let its currency rise more quickly. Last week,\nPremier  Wen Jiabao  said that a 20 percent jump in the yuan risks\n\u201cmajor\u201d social upheaval and job losses.
