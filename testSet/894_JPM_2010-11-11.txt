 "context": "The following article called 'BNP Paribas, HP-Oracle, KWL, Foreclosure Probe in Court News' was published on 2010-11-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBNP Paribas SA  and  Groupe Credit\nAgricole  are confronting three former bond traders at a Paris\ncriminal trial on claims the men orchestrated deals in the 1990s\nto inflate bond prices and pocket the profits.  The traders, who worked for what are now units of the\nbanks, are accused by Paris prosecutors of abuse of trust and\nfraud after a nearly 12-year probe found as much as 200 million\nFrench francs ($34 million) was siphoned into overseas funds for\ntheir use.  An investigation found the men \u201cdeliberately hid what was\nbeing done from superiors,\u201d Judge Agnes Quantin said in opening\nthe four-day trial Nov. 8.  The trial spotlights the practices of bond traders a decade\nbefore Jerome Kerviel\u2019s unauthorized derivatives trading cost\nFrance\u2019s second-largest bank,  Societe Generale SA , 4.9 billion\neuros. Testimony at times echoed Kerviel\u2019s June trial, with two\ntraders asserting they followed \u201cnormal\u201d practices while the\nbanks said they had no idea what was happening.  \u201cMr. Kerviel was just one man,\u201d Claude Bendel, a lawyer\nfor the Credit Agricole units, said yesterday. While the affairs\nare \u201cvery closely related,\u201d he said, \u201chere we are in the\npresence of a gang -- no one acted alone.\u201d  Defendants Ariel Cheminaud, 46, Noureddine Benameur, 49,\nand Olivier Moulines, 49, deny the charges, and claim they never\ncollaborated or benefited on the trades. The men face as much as\n375,000 euros in fines and five years in jail if convicted.  \u201cThese transactions were perfectly normal,\u201d Cheminaud, a\nbroker for CPRI, part of  Credit Agricole  since 2000, said in\ntestimony Nov. 8.  The men traded illiquid bonds, selling them at a slightly\nhigher price to intermediaries in the U.K. that were acting for\noffshore accounts, according to the investigation. Those\noffshore groups, which the men allegedly controlled, then sold\nthe bonds back to the traders for even more, producing profits\nthat were hidden in the offshore funds.  \u201cThese intermediaries were useless,\u201d BNP Paribas lawyer\nArnaud de la Cotardiere said. They were \u201ca fake way to send the\nprofits abroad.\u201d  For more, click here.  HP\u2019s Apotheker, Like Carmen Sandiego, Focus at Trial  The hottest new game at the  Oracle Corp. -SAP AG\ninfringement trial has become \u201cWhere in the World is Leo\nApotheker?\u201d  Oracle lawyers want to put the former SAP chief executive\nofficer on the stand in federal court in Oakland, California, to\ntestify about the conduct of a now-defunct  SAP  unit that\nillegally downloaded Oracle\u2019s copyrighted software. Apotheker, a\n22-year SAP veteran, was on the software maker\u2019s executive board\nwhen it bought TomorrowNow in 2005, and he oversaw the unit\u2019s\nsales, according to court documents and trial testimony.  Apotheker, who resigned from SAP in February, was hired by\n Hewlett - Packard Co.  in September and was to start as CEO on Nov.\n1. HP has refused to accept papers seeking to call Apotheker to\nthe stand, and Oracle attorneys have said they can\u2019t find him.  \u201cWe are trying real hard to find him and he\u2019s trying real\nhard not to let us find him,\u201d David Boies, Oracle\u2019s lead\nattorney at the trial, said Nov. 8. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find him, and\nwe\u2019ve got to find him in California.\u201d  Apotheker gave an interview to the Nikkei business daily on\nNov. 5, published in Japanese a day later, that said he was in\nTokyo.  Redwood City, California-based  Oracle , which has a video of\nsworn testimony that Apotheker gave its lawyers in 2008, says\nit\u2019s important for the jury in Oakland to hear live testimony\nfrom him. Oracle claims Apotheker, 57, \u201cwas at the center of\nthe infringement\u201d and \u201cpersonally approved\u201d the activities of\nthe Bryan, Texas-based TomorrowNow software maintenance unit,\nBoies said in a news conference outside the courthouse in\nOakland.  Oracle, the  second-largest maker  of software for business\napplications behind Walldorf, Germany-based SAP, is seeking\ndamages of as much as $2 billion in the trial.  HP said Nov. 3 that Apotheker had limited knowledge of\nTomorrowNow. Oracle is trying to harass him and interfere with\nhis new role at HP, said Mylene Mangalindan, a spokeswoman for\nthe Palo Alto, California-based company, in an e-mailed\nstatement on Nov. 3.  The case is Oracle Corp. v. SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District\nCourt, Northern District of California (Oakland).  For more, click here.  Ex-Leipzig Utility Manager Tried Over Deal With UBS  The former head of a German municipal utility must stand\ntrial over alleged bribes connected to collateralized debt\nobligation transactions with  UBS AG  and other banks, a court\nruled.  Klaus Heininger, the former managing director of KWL-\nKommunale Wasserwerke Leipzig GmbH, will be tried starting Nov.\n26 on charges of accepting bribes, breach of trust, falsifying\nfinancial statements and tax evasion, the Leipzig Regional Court\nsaid in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Two other suspects,\ncharged with bribing Heininger, will also be defendants in the\ncase.  \u201cHeininger allegedly accepted considerable monetary\nadvantages in order to close highly risky agreements in the name\nof KWL, which may have led to a default risk of 280 million\neuros ($384 million),\u201d the court said.  KWL in February filed a suit in Leipzig, Germany, against\nUBS, Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg and  Depfa Bank Plc  to\ninvalidate the CDO transactions in which KWL assumed guarantees\nfor unsecured loans. The utility claims that the transactions\nwere closed without proper authorization.  Uwe Freyschmidt, Heininger\u2019s lawyer, didn\u2019t reply to a call\nand an e-mail seeking comment. KWL spokesman Jochen Endle\ndeclined to comment. UBS and the other banks aren\u2019t accused of\nwrongdoing in the criminal case.  UBS sued KWL in January in London over the issue. The\nLondon High Court of Justice  ruled  Oct. 15 that it can hear the\nUBS suit because the transactions fall under English law.  Heininger, who was fired last year and arrested in\nFebruary, may have evaded 1.6 million euros in taxes because he\ndidn\u2019t declare the alleged bribes as income, the court said.

Lawsuits/Pretrial  Foreclosure Probe on \u2018Fast Track,\u2019 Iowa\u2019s Miller Says  The investigation by attorneys general in 50 U.S. states\ninto banks\u2019 foreclosure practices is on \u201ca fast track\u201d and any\nresolution might involve multiple settlements, Iowa Attorney\nGeneral Tom Miller told Bloomberg News\u2019 Margaret Cronin Fisk.  \u201cWe\u2019d like to resolve this sooner rather than later,\u201d\nMiller, who is leading the attorneys general task force, said in\nan interview. \u201cWe want to move quickly if we can, but not so\nquickly that we don\u2019t do it right.\u201d  A global settlement of the task force investigation is\nunlikely, said Miller, 66, who also leads a separate foreclosure\nprevention group of state attorneys general. \u201cIt would be one\nbank at a time.\u201d Miller, who was first elected attorney general\nin 1978 and whose successes include $809 million from two\nearlier settlements over home loans, didn\u2019t speculate on when or\nhow this investigation might be resolved.  All 50 states on Oct. 13 announced the coordinated inquiry\ninto whether banks and loan servicers used false documents and\nsignatures to justify hundreds of thousands of foreclosures. The\nprobe came after  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and  Ally Financial Inc. \u2019s\nGMAC mortgage unit said they would stop repossessions in 23\nstates where courts supervise home seizures and  Bank of America\nCorp.  froze foreclosures nationwide.  At least 19 states, including Iowa and Texas, are\nconducting separate investigations to determine whether state\nlaws were broken. Some began investigations months before the\ncoordinated nationwide probe was announced.  States have asked lenders to halt foreclosures, requested\ndocuments and sought better home-loan modification procedures.\nOhio\u2019s attorney general sued, accusing Ally Financial of\nconsumer fraud.  Some lenders have acknowledged that employees may have\ncompleted court affidavits without confirming their accuracy. In\nDecember, a GMAC employee said in a deposition in a foreclosure\ncase in West Palm Beach, Florida, that his team of 13 people\nsigned about 10,000 documents a month without verifying the\naccuracy of the information in them.

Judge Tells ESun to Mediate Casino Dispute With Investors  A Hong Kong judge told an  eSun Holdings Ltd.  unit and its\npartners in a Macau, China, casino project including  Oaktree\nCapital Management LP  and Silver Point Capital LP to settle\ntheir dispute through mediation.  Any unreasonable refusal to try to settle would result in a\nreduced award at the end of a trial, High Court Judge A.T. Reyes\nsaid at a hearing yesterday on petitions by each partner for the\nother to be ordered to drop their interest in the project.  ESun unit East Asia Satellite Television (Holdings) Ltd.\nand New Cotai LLC, owned by Oaktree, Silver Point and former  Las\nVegas Sands Corp.  executive David Friedman, announced plans for\na $4 billion casino complex in 2007. East Asia and New Cotai are\nnow suing each other for hindering the development of the\nproject.  \u201cInstead of the parties sitting at a table arguing, you\nhave someone come in who tries to help the parties perhaps see\nit from a different perspective,\u201d said Charles Allen, an\naccredited mediator based in Hong Kong.  Parties who don\u2019t make a reasonable effort to resolve\ndisputes in mediation when directed to do so can have legal\ncosts deducted from any award, according to the court\u2019s rules,\nhe said.  Friedman declined to comment after yesterday\u2019s hearing,\nciting the ongoing litigation.  David Goh, a lawyer for eSun, said the company is\ndiscussing the prospect of mediation with its legal advisers and\ndeclined to comment further.  For more, click here.
