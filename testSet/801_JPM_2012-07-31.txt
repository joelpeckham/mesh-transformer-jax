 "context": "The following article called 'Deutsche Bank to Cut 1,900 Jobs as Part of Savings Plan' was published on 2012-07-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Bank AG (DBK)  said it will\neliminate 1,900 jobs by the end of the year, including 1,500 at\nthe investment bank and support areas, as part of an effort to\nsave 3 billion euros ($3.68 billion).  Germany \u2019s biggest lender, which employed 10,079 at the\ninvestment bank at the end of June, said most of the positions\nslated for removal at the unit will be outside Germany. The\nFrankfurt-based lender forecast \u201csubstantial costs\u201d to achieve\nthe savings without giving an exact figure in a statement to the\nstock exchange today.  The job reductions were prompted by a strategy review Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen, Deutsche Bank\u2019s new co-chief\nexecutive officers, are conducting as the lender grapples with\ndeclining revenue from the investment bank, which reported a 63\npercent decline in second-quarter earnings today. Pretax profit\nat the unit slid to 357 million euros, missing the 835 million-\neuro average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  \u201cDeutsche has a first-class  investment banking  franchise\nbut it has recognized the need to take cuts,\u201d  Christopher\nWheeler , a Mediobanca SpA analyst in London who has the\nequivalent of a sell rating on the shares, said. \u201cIt is very\ndifficult in this environment to make those cost savings work\nbecause revenue is often going against you and you don\u2019t have\nany leverage. The 3 billion-euro target is very bold.\u201d  Sovereign Debt Woes  \u201cThe European sovereign debt crisis continues to weigh on\ninvestor confidence and client activity across the bank,\u201d Jain\nand Fitschen said in the statement.  Investment banks are cutting staff to reduce costs as the\ndebt crisis curbs trading and leads to a slump in stock and bond\nofferings. Deutsche Bank is reviewing its \u201cabsolute level of\ncompensation\u201d and the \u201crelative balance between rewards for\nshareholders and those for employees\u201d as part of a cultural\nchange within the bank, it said.  \u201cThe time for vague promises of cultural change in our\nindustry is long gone,\u201d Jain said on a conference call with\nanalysts and reporters. Deutsche Bank\u2019s leaders are \u201ctotally\ndetermined to act quickly and decisively.\u201d  The bank is also reviewing its codes of personal conduct to\nensure they are in line with \u201cits long tradition of doing\nbusiness to the highest standards.\u201d  Libor Probe  Deutsche Bank is among the 18 banks being probed into\npossible interest-rate manipulation. The bank \u201ccontinues to\ncooperate with regulators on Libor,\u201d  Stefan Krause , the chief\nfinancial officer, said on the conference call.  \u201cNo current or former member of the Management Board had\nany inappropriate involvement in the interbank offered rates\nmatters under review,\u201d  Paul Achleitner , the chairman of the\nsupervisory board, said in a letter to employees today.  \u201cA limited number of employees, acting on their own\ninitiative, engaged in conduct that falls short of the Bank\u2019s\nstandards, and action has been taken accordingly,\u201d Achleitner\nsaid.  Deutsche Bank, whose stock has  declined  16 percent this\nyear, pared losses to trade down 0.1 percent at 24.82 euros as\nof 5:03 p.m. The Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services\nIndex, which tracks 38 stocks, has fallen 1.1 percent since Dec.\n31.  Deutsche Bank\u2019s second-quarter profit dropped 46 percent to\n650 million euros, the company said today, after last week\nreporting an estimated net income figure of about 700 million\neuros in a preliminary report.

Analysts\nestimated costs of 2.77 billion euros for the unit in a\nBloomberg survey. Debt-trading revenue at the division fell to\n2.18 billion euros from 2.35 billion euros.

Risks related to Spain fell to 873 million euros from\n1.36 billion euros while those related to Italy rose to 2.52\nbillion euros from 1.95 billion euros, the slides show.  Holding Back  The uncertainties stemming from the  European debt crisis \nand the recovery in the U.S. as well as legal risks affect the\noutlook for Germany\u2019s biggest lender.  \u201cThe current environment continues to result in\nsignificant lower levels of client activity, both in investment\nbanking as well as in certain parts of our retail business,\u2018\u2018\nDeutsche Bank said in its quarterly report today.\u2018\u2018We expect\nthis to continue in the second half of the year.\u2019\u2019  \u2018\u2018Investors and companies are holding back from bond and\nshare sales because of the high level of uncertainty on markets\nfrom Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis,\u2019\u2019 said Michael Seufert, an\nanalyst with Norddeutsche Landesbank in Hanover who recommends\ninvestors hold the stock. \u2018\u2018Right now, the bank is focused on\ndamage limitation and minimizing risk in this environment.\u2019\u2019  JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  had combined\nfirst-half revenue of $161 billion, down 4.5 percent from 2011\nand the lowest since $135 billion four years ago. The firms\nblamed the decline on low  interest rates  and a drop in trading\nand deal-making driven by concerns about European government\nfinances and slowing growth in the U.S. and China.

Banks are under orders from regulators to raise capital to\navoid a repeat of the taxpayer-funded bailouts of the 2008\nfinancial crisis. Deutsche Bank, the third-least capitalized of\nEurope\u2019s 10 biggest banks at the end of 2011, came under more\npressure after  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  bowed this month to\ndemands from the  Swiss National Bank  to increase reserves.  After announcing profit that missed analysts\u2019 estimates\nlast week, Deutsche Bank said it will expand its risk reduction\nprogram to meet new  capital requirements , known as Basel III,\nthat begin to take effect next year.  Deutsche Bank said it will \u201capply all capital levers at\nits disposal before considering raising equity from investors\u201d\nto fulfill regulatory requirements. The bank plans to achieve a\ncore Tier 1 ratio, a measure of a bank\u2019s capital strength, of at\nleast eight percent, a target that simulates a full\nimplementation of the new capital rules, by the end of the first\nquarter of 2013.
