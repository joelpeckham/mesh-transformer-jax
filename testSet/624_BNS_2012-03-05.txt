 "context": "The following article called 'Canadian Dollar Declines for Second Day as China Derails Investor Optimism' was published on 2012-03-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanada \u2019s dollar weakened versus its\nU.S. counterpart for a second day and fell against a majority of\nits most-traded counterparts after China lowered its growth\nforecast, crimping demand for higher-risk assets.  The currency touched the lowest level in almost a week\nversus the greenback and dropped for the first time in five days\nversus the yen. Canada\u2019s central bank meets on March 8 to\ndetermine interest rates, with all 25 economists in a Bloomberg\nsurvey predicting no change from 1 percent. Crude oil gained and\nstocks fell.  \u201cThe Canadian dollar is reacting to China\u2019s news,\u201d said\n Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) \nin Toronto. \u201cThe broad theme of central-bank liquidity and\nextraordinarily low volatility seems to be leaving us with very\nquiet markets.\u201d  Canada\u2019s dollar, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the\naquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.5 percent to 99.46\ncents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It touched 99.60\ncents, the weakest level since Feb. 28. One Canadian dollar\npurchases $1.0053.  Sutton cited 10 central-bank meetings, the Greek bond swap\nand dual U.S. and Canadian employment numbers as events that may\ndrive markets this week.  Low Volatility  Implied volatility for one-month options on Canada\u2019s dollar\nversus the greenback increased from the lowest level in almost\nfive years. It touched 7.65 percent today after reaching 6.90\npercent on Feb. 24, the least on an intraday basis since June\n2007. Implied volatility, which traders quote and use to set\noption prices, signals the expected pace of swings in the\nunderlying currency. The five-year average is 12 percent.  Canadian employers added 15,000 positions to payrolls last\nmonth, after increasing them by 2,300 in January, according to\nthe median of 23 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Statistics\nCanada  releases the  data  on March 9 in Ottawa.  The Bank of Canada will leave its benchmark  interest rate \nat 1 percent, where it\u2019s stood for more than a year, until the\nfirst quarter of 2013, according to the weighted average of 20\nresponses in a Bloomberg survey.  The Canadian currency on March 2 capped its strongest\nweekly gain since January on speculation officials are\ncontaining Europe\u2019s debt crisis and as U.S. economic indicators\nimprove, bolstering optimism that quickening global growth will\nraise demand for Canadian exports such as oil and copper.  China Paring  Government bonds  were little changed, with benchmark  10-\nyear (GCAN10YR)  yields at 1.97 percent after falling six basis points, or\n0.06 percentage point, last week.  Two-year yields traded at 1.11 percent after rising three\nbasis points last week.  China  pared its economic growth target to 7.5 percent from\nan 8 percent goal in place since 2005, a signal that leaders are\ndetermined to cut reliance on exports and  capital spending  in\nfavor of consumption.  Officials will aim for inflation of about 4 percent this\nyear, unchanged from the 2011 goal, according to Premier  Wen\nJiabao \u2019s state-of-the-nation speech, delivered at the annual\nmeeting of the National People\u2019s Congress in Beijing.  \u201cWe were a bit risk-averse going into the weekend; the\nChina slowdown has added to that,\u201d said Kit Juckes, head of\nforeign-exchange research at Societe Generale SA in  London .\n\u201cThe Canadian dollar will perform much in line with risk\nhesitation. I\u2019m optimistic medium-term, but I think all of these\nmoves have run out of steam a little bit,\u201d he said, referring\nto recent gains in commodity-linked currencies.  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent, and the\nMSCI World Index of stocks dropped 0.5 percent. Crude oil gained\n0.6 percent.  Gained Last Week  The Canadian currency outperformed 14 of its 16 most-traded\ncounterparts last week as the price of crude oil, the country\u2019s\nbiggest export, touched the highest level since 2008. Jobless-\ninsurance claims fell and  consumer confidence  rose in the U.S.,\nthe nation\u2019s biggest trade partner.  The Canadian currency ended March 1 at 98.55 cents, the\nlowest closing price since Sept. 16.  \u201cThe daily close below 98.83 cents has reaffirmed the\nbearish backdrop for the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian\ndollar,\u201d  George Davis , chief technical analyst for fixed income\nand currency strategy at Royal  Bank of Canada  in Toronto, wrote\nin a note to clients today. \u201cPrices have returned above this\nlevel as the risk backdrop adopts a more cautious tone to begin\nthe week. Prices will have to close above C$1.0151 in order to\nsignal a more material price correction is getting under way.\u201d  Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said his plan to\nreturn the country\u2019s finances to balance in coming years is on\nschedule, giving the government scope to reduce taxes and pay\ndown debt, potentially increasing the attractiveness of the\nnation\u2019s currency.  Speaking to reporters after meeting with private-sector\neconomists in Ottawa today ahead of his March 29 budget,\nFlaherty said there is more optimism about the  U.S. economy \nsince his last fiscal update in November, even though  Europe \nremains a concern.
