 "context": "The following article called 'Fed Playing Favorites With Wall Street in Secretive Bond Deals: Mortgages' was published on 2012-02-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Federal Reserve secretly\nselected a handful of banks to bid for debt securities acquired\nby taxpayers in the U.S. bailout of American International Group\nInc., and the rest of  Wall Street  is wondering what happened to\nthe transparency the central bank said it was committed to\nupholding.  \u201cThe exclusivity by which the process has shut out smaller\ndealers is a little un-American,\u201d said  David Castillo , head of\nsales and trading at broker Further Lane Securities LP in  San\nFrancisco , who said he would have liked to participate. \u201cIt\nseems odd that if you want to get the best possible price that\nit wouldn\u2019t be open to anyone who wants to put in the most\ncompetitive bid.\u201d  After inviting more than 40 broker-dealers to take part in\na series of auctions last year, the Federal Reserve Bank of  New\nYork  asked only  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) \nand  Barclays Plc (BARC)  to bid on the full $13.2 billion of bonds\noffered in two  sales  over the past month. The central bank\nswitched to a less open process after traders blamed the\nregular, more public disposals for damaging prices in 2011. This\nweek, Goldman Sachs  bought  $6.2 billion of bonds in an auction.  The selectivity has irked firms that weren\u2019t also given the\nchance to profit from the auctions, and raises the question of\nwhether the Fed got the highest price for U.S. taxpayers, who\ngave insurer AIG a $182.3 billion bailout. The New York Fed\nresumed its sales of the assets in January after the market\nrecouped a portion of last year\u2019s losses.  \u2018Crony Capitalism\u2019  \u201cThe purpose should be to get the best price for the\ntaxpayer,\u201d said  Robert Eisenbeis , a former research director at\nthe  Federal Reserve  Bank of Atlanta who\u2019s now chief monetary\neconomist for Sarasota, Florida-based Cumberland Advisors.\n\u201cAnybody knows the more bidders the better, so it\u2019s a little\nhard to understand why they would essentially pick potential\nwinners and losers. That smacks of crony capitalism.\u201d  Andrea Priest, a spokeswoman for the New York Fed, declined\nto comment.  The New York Fed announced in March that it would sell the\nbonds held in a vehicle called Maiden Lane II LLC, created in\n2008 to buy holdings that AIG handed the Fed in exchange for a\ncash injection. The portfolio includes bonds backed by the types\nof home loans with some of the highest default rates, such as\n subprime , Alt-A and option adjustable-rate mortgages that helped\nfuel the  housing  boom and bust. Those securities, which can be\ndifficult to value, offer a chance for a bigger profit to a\nsavvy investor.  \u2018Competitive Sales\u2019  The regional Fed bank said in a March 30 statement that it\nwould \u201cdispose of the securities in the ML II portfolio\nindividually and in segments over time as market conditions\nwarrant through a competitive sales process,\u201d and that it would\nalso \u201centertain investor inquiries to acquire specific parcels\nof securities where these offer superior value.\u201d  It announced that it would undertake the sales after\nrejecting a $15.7 billion offer from  AIG (AIG)  for the entire pool.\n\u201cOffering the Maiden Lane securities for sale individually and\nin segments rather than as a single block will give a larger set\nof investors opportunity to bid for the assets,\u201d the regional\nFed bank said in the March 30 statement. \u201cThis will maximize\nsale proceeds.\u201d  Twenty-two dealers bought bonds in the New York Fed\u2019s\nMaiden Lane II auctions last year, with  Bank of America Corp. \nand Citigroup Inc. topping the list of buyers. Before each\nauction, the regional Fed bank posted on its website the amount\nit planned to sell and when. Dealers widely shared the names of\nindividual securities that were being offered and the second-\nbest bids that were reported.  Damaging Credit Markets  The New York Fed was criticized for damaging credit markets\nwith the regular sales, and halted them in June after disposing\nof about $10 billion in face value of the assets.  It resumed the sales on Jan. 19, when it unloaded about $7\nbillion of assets in one block to Credit Suisse, after receiving\nan unsolicited bid for the securities from Goldman Sachs. Only\nBarclays and Bank of America were invited to also participate in\nthat auction. Goldman Sachs won the auction for $6.2 billion of\nbonds this week after Credit Suisse placed an unsolicited bid\nfor the assets. Barclays,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and RBS Securities Inc.\nwere also included in that sale. Barclays presented the second-\nhighest offer in both auctions this year, according to a person\nfamiliar with the process.  The New York Fed didn\u2019t announce either auction until after\nthey closed, and said the broker-dealers it included were chosen\nbased on the strength of previous bids. The Wall Street firms,\nand their clients who wished to bid on the assets, were required\nto sign non-disclosure agreements forbidding them from\ndiscussing the offerings. At least one investor opted not to\nparticipate for that reason.  \u2018Chinese Wall\u2019  \u201cOur compliance people took a very conservative view of the\nnon-disclosure agreement,\u201d James Keegan, chief investment\nofficer at Seix Investment Advisors LLC in  Upper Saddle River ,\n New Jersey , which manages about $30 billion. \u201cSince we don\u2019t\nhave 20 securitized traders, we couldn\u2019t put someone behind a\n\u2018Chinese wall\u2019 and continue to conduct business.\u201d  The Fed\u2019s less-transparent approach didn\u2019t drag down\nmarkets like their more public auctions did last year, and\nanalysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America said the first\nsale contributed to gains by highlighting demand.  Further Lane\u2019s Castillo, whose broker participated in the\nauctions last year, said \u201cit seems like the process has been\nworking for the New York Fed.\u201d  Typical prices for the most-senior bonds tied to option ARMs\nclimbed to 55 cents on the dollar last week from 49 cents in\nOctober and November, according to Barclays Capital data. That\u2019s\ndown from last year\u2019s high of 65 cents in February. Option ARMs\nallow borrowers to pay less than the interest they owe by\nincreasing their balances.  Following Dexia  \u201cLimiting it to the dealers that in the New York Fed\u2019s\nopinion they trust to be the best cuts down on the price\ndiscovery that\u2019s important in illiquid markets like this,\u201d said\nJason Weaver, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. in\nNashville,  Tennessee . At the same time, those dealers were ones\nthat \u201cthey had the confidence had the ability would get the\ntransaction done and done quickly and without any problems.\u201d  The Fed followed an approach undertaken by other firms\nlooking to unload billions of dollars of assets without roiling\nmarkets.  Dexia SA (DEXB) , which said in August it sold $8.8 billion of\nmortgage bonds, and State Street Corp., which sold $11 billion\nin assets in December 2010, also turned to a limited number of\ndealers rather than widely distributed auction lists to dispose\nof holdings. Dexia, the lender now being dismantled by Belgium\nand  France , had publicly announced its intention to sell; State\nStreet, the third-largest custody bank, hadn\u2019t.  Goldman Holds Bonds  \u201cYou certainly don\u2019t want to lose that one buyer because\nyou feel a need to go through with all the formalities,\u201d Joseph Vitale, a partner in New York at Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP, who\nsaid he wasn\u2019t involved in the transaction.  Goldman Sachs held onto almost all of the bonds the New\nYork Fed sold to it for at least a day, rather than mainly\nfulfilling client orders as Credit Suisse did last month, based\non data from Trace, the transaction reporting system of the\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Goldman Sachs told some investors who bid on the bonds\nthrough the bank that, while they had offered the best prices on\nindividual securities, the firm had bought the debt for itself,\naccording to three money managers with knowledge of the matter.\nGoldman Sachs then offered the securities for sale to the\ninvestors, they said. The prices were between 1 and 3 cents on\nthe dollar higher, said one of the people, who declined to be\nidentified because the transactions aren\u2019t public.  Willing Market  \u201cOur intention has always been to distribute the portfolio\nto our clients globally and we are in the midst of doing that,\u201d\nsaid  Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs spokesman.  The method the New York Fed employed may have been less\nimportant than market conditions following a slump in prices, as\nsigns of a strengthening U.S. economy, fading European debt\ncrisis and change in the calendar year embolden investors and\ndealers, said Ken Hackel, head of securitized product strategy\nat CRT Capital Group LLC.  \u201cMore than anything else, it\u2019s that they\u2019re selling to a\nvery willing market at this point,\u201d said Hackel, whose\nStamford, Connecticut-based bond broker was one of the dealers\nthat participated in last year\u2019s auctions.  Public Fashion  It\u2019s not clear that the Fed\u2019s approach resulted in higher\nprices than if the bonds had been sold in a more piecemeal and\nopen fashion, said Adam Murphy, president of  Empirasign\nStrategies LLC , a New York-based provider of data on\nsecuritization-market trading.  \u201cI fail to see how running a limited participation, secret\nauction is any way beneficial to the owners of these bonds, the\nU.S. taxpayer,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cNot to mention these bonds are\nnow trading 15 to 25 cents\u201d on the dollar \u201ccheaper compared to\nwhen they were last auctioned in a more public manner.\u201d  This week\u2019s $6.2 billion sale to Goldman Sachs allows the\nrepayment of the central bank\u2019s loan to  Maiden Lane II (FARBML2) , which\nwas originally $19.5 billion. While the Fed hasn\u2019t disclosed the\nprices paid, it was owed about $6.7 billion on its loan to the\nfacility as of Feb. 1, not taking into account proceeds from\nlast month\u2019s transaction. About $6 billion of assets remain in\nthe vehicle, based on Fed disclosures.  The New York Fed said Feb. 8 that it \u201cwill dispose of the\nremaining securities in the ML II portfolio individually and in\nsegments over time as market conditions warrant through a\ncompetitive sales process, while taking appropriate care to\navoid market disruption.\u201d  A separate facility,  Maiden Lane III (FARBML3)  LLC, helped retire\ncredit-default swaps that were sold by the insurer to protect\nbanks from losses on securities tied to subprime mortgages. AIG\nsaid in March 2009 that Goldman Sachs received $12.9 billion\nfrom the insurer to settle securities-lending and credit-swap\ncontracts from the 2008 bailout. The Fed was owed about $9.6\nbillion as of Feb. 1 from its loan to Maiden Lane III.
