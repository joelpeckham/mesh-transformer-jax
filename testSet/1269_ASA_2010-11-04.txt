 "context": "The following article called 'Statoil Puts Should Be Sold Because Shares Will Rise, RBS Strategists Say' was published on 2010-11-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInvestors should sell bearish Statoil\nASA options because Norway\u2019s largest oil and natural-gas\nproducer will rebound after falling yesterday because of lower-\nthan-estimated  profit , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc said.  Equity derivatives strategists  Stephen Einchcomb  and  Bhavin Patel  recommended selling January 110 kroner puts on the stock,\nwhich fell 5.4 percent to 122.4 kroner in Oslo yesterday for the\nbiggest loss since May. Selling puts, which give the right to\nsell shares, is a bet that the stock won\u2019t fall below the strike\nprice, allowing the seller to keep what the buyer paid.  The strategists cited  Barry MacCarthy , an RBS oil industry\n analyst , who says Statoil probably won\u2019t extend losses because\nit rises along with crude prices and will rally on the Federal\nReserve\u2019s stimulus measures. Put selling is favorable because\nprices for the contracts have remained high relative to calls\nthat give the right to buy shares, the London-based strategists\nsaid.  \u201cThis makes Statoil options appear more expensive at\npresent, thus selling options seems an attractive strategy in\nthis environment,\u201d they said. \u201cAlthough near-term upside may\nbe limited (due to negative sentiment regarding the government\nintervention), Barry believes that the downside should be well\nsupported.\u201d  Implied volatility , the key gauge of options prices, for\nStatoil puts that are 10 percent below the stock price is 1.27\ntimes higher than bullish contracts priced the same amount above\nthe last closing level. That\u2019s the highest premium for put\noptions since August.  Lower Production Forecast  The strategy makes the most profit if the stock remains\nabove 110 kroner at expiration on Jan. 20, and it breaks even if\nthe shares are above 108.5 kroner. Statoil hasn\u2019t closed below\n110 kroner since March 2009.  The Stavanger-based company cut its full-year production\nforecast because of halts at fields and missing analysts\u2019\nestimates for adjusted profit. The output projection for this\nyear was cut to 1.9 million barrels of oil equivalent a day,\nfrom 1.925 million to 1.975 million a day. Adjusted net income\nfell 8 percent to 8.5 billion kroner ($1.4 billion), missing the\n9.2 billion-krone average estimate in a survey of analysts.  Oil rose to the highest level in six months after a U.S.\ngovernment report showed that fuel supplies tumbled and the\nFederal Reserve said it will buy an additional $600 billion of\nTreasuries through June to boost the economy. Futures have risen\n6.4 percent in New York during the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJeff Kearns in New York at \n jkearns3@bloomberg.net .
