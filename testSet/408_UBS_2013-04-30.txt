 "context": "The following article called 'Europe to Be Cooler Than Usual for Third Month: Forecasters' was published on 2013-04-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMost of  Europe  will be cooler than\nnormal for a third month in May while the Nordic region will be\nwarmer than average, according to weather forecasters.  Below-average sea surface temperatures in the North\nAtlantic will probably limit any temperature increases in\ncentral Europe and the U.K., Bradley Harvey, an operational\nmeteorologist at MDA Information Systems LLC, said by e-mail.\nMeteorologists at Deutscher Wetterdienst, WSI Corp., Meteogroup\nU.K. Ltd. and MetraWeather also forecast below-normal\ntemperatures.  \u201cThere is a signal for higher-than-average pressure to\npersist close to the U.K. or close to northwest Europe,\u201d Matt Hugo, a forecaster at MetraWeather, said by e-mail. \u201cThis may\nlead to a cool north or northwesterly air mass becoming\nestablished across central and northern areas of Europe around\nthe middle of May.\u201d  European power and natural  gas prices  typically decline in\nthe summer months as increased daylight hours boost solar\ngeneration and demand for heating drops. Gas storage levels\nacross Europe fell to a record on April 14, supporting prices in\nthe coming months as operators refill depleted stocks,  Societe\nGenerale SA (GLE)  said last week.  The average temperature in the U.K. will be 10 degrees\nCelsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) through May 14, according to a\nGFS model supplied by MetraWeather at 11:42 a.m. London time.\nThat compares with a seasonal norm of 11.2 degrees for the\ncoming week.  Wind, Solar  In Germany, the average temperature will be 11.9 degrees\nthrough May 14, the data show. The seasonal norm, based on\nrecords from 1981 to 2010, is about 13 degrees Celsius,\nChristian Herold, a meteorologist at DWD, said by telephone from\nOffenbach, Germany.  The country generated 16.2 terawatt-hours of its power from\nwind and solar in the first three months of this year, down 17\npercent from a year earlier, according to data from the\nMuenster-based  International Economic Forum for Renewable\nEnergies , the nation\u2019s energy-research institute.  Wind generation in  Germany  is forecast to increase from May\n3 and solar production is expected to improve in the seven days\nfrom May 6, said Stephen Davenport, a senior energy\nmeteorologist in London at MeteoGroup.  Power generation from solar panels in Germany could rise to\n25,000 megawatts on single days, Patrick Hummel, a Zurich-based\nanalyst at UBS AG said in a research note last week. The price\nfor power to be delivered in May dropped as much as 2 percent\ntoday to a record 31.75 euros a megawatt-hour, according to\nbroker data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract is headed for a\n9.5 percent loss this month.  Temperatures are predicted to be above average in\nScandinavia and some neighboring countries through May 11,\naccording to MetraWeather\u2019s Hugo.  July Temperatures  Southern Europe and the Nordic region will be warmer than\naverage in June, with the rest of the continent cooler than\nusual, WSI said. All of Europe, except the U.K. and western\nparts of the mainland, will be warmer than normal in July,\naccording to WSI.
