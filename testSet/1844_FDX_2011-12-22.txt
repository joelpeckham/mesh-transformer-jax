 "context": "The following article called 'Jobless Claims in U.S. Decrease to Lowest Since April 2008' was published on 2011-12-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFewer Americans than forecast sought\njobless benefits and  consumer confidence  climbed, giving the\nworld\u2019s largest economy a boost heading into 2012.  Unemployment claims  fell by 4,000 to 364,000 in the week\nended Dec. 17, the lowest level since April 2008, Labor\nDepartment figures showed today in Washington. The Bloomberg\nConsumer Comfort Index improved to minus 45 in the period ended\nDec. 18 from a reading of minus 49.9 the prior week, marking the\nbiggest seven-day gain since January.  A decline in firings and the cheapest gasoline prices since\nFebruary are helping revive retail sales during the busiest\nshopping season of the year. A stronger consumer, whose spending\naccounts for 70 percent of the economy, raises the odds the U.S.\ncan ride out the debt crisis in  Europe  or failure by Congress to\nextend tax cuts.  \u201cSpending has looked pretty good so far, and continued job\nand income growth will help maintain that,\u201d said Samuel Coffin,\nan economist at UBS Securities LLC in  New York , who projected\nclaims would fall to 365,000. \u201cAt some point, events in Europe\nare likely to have some effect on activity, but we\u2019re heading\ninto that headwind with a lot of momentum.\u201d  Stocks rose on the improving jobs outlook, sending the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index higher for a third day. The gauge\nincreased 0.8 percent to 1,254 at the close in New York.\n Treasury securities  also advanced, sending the yield on the\nbenchmark 10-year note down to 1.96 percent from 1.97 late\nyesterday.  Survey Results  The  median forecast  of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg\nNews projected an increase in jobless claims to 380,000.\nEstimates ranged from 355,000 to 400,000. The number of\napplications has dropped by 40,000 over the past three weeks.  \u201cThis is great news,\u201d  Ian Shepherdson , chief U.S.\neconomist at High Frequency Economics Ltd. in Valhalla, New\nYork, said in a note to clients. \u201cOne unexpectedly low number\ncan easily be a fluke. Two are interesting. Three are telling us\nsomething real is happening in the labor market.\u201d  The decrease in claims is consistent with payroll gains of\nabout 200,000 a month, Shepherdson said.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits\nfell by 79,000 in the week ended Dec. 10 to 3.55 million, the\nlowest since September 2008.  In data out of Europe, economic growth in the U.K.\naccelerated more than previously estimated in the third quarter\nin a surge that the  Bank of England  says is unlikely to be\nrepeated as Europe\u2019s debt crisis curbs bank lending and dents\nconfidence. Gross domestic product rose 0.6 percent from the\nprevious quarter, faster than the 0.5 percent reported last\nmonth, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in  London .  Confidence Boost  The drop in firings in the U.S. may be helping boost\nconfidence. The Bloomberg comfort index rose last week to the\nhighest level in five months as all three components -- state of\nthe economy, buying climate and personal finances -- improved.  A monthly  expectations gauge  climbed to minus 17 for\nDecember, a seven-month high.  Sentiment among Democrats advanced 12.1 points to minus\n39.2, the highest since mid-June, while sentiment among\nRepublicans rose 2.1 points to minus 43.1.  The improvement in President Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating\nto 49 percent in an ABC News/ Washington  Post poll this week may\nbe behind the increase in optimism,  Gary Langer , president of\nLanger Research Associates LLC in New York, which compiles the\nindex for Bloomberg, said in a statement.  \u201cA slower pace of firing and stabilization in the broader\nlabor market are the likely sources for bolstered consumer\nsentiment,\u201d said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior economist at\nBloomberg LP in New York. \u201cWhile challenges remain, it\u2019s a\nsolid note to close what has been an otherwise discordant\n2011.\u201d  The figures are consistent with other findings. The Thomson\nReuters/University of Michigan final index of  consumer sentiment \nclimbed to 69.9 in December, a six-month high, from 64.1 at the\nend of November, the group said today.  Cheaper Gasoline  Lower fuel costs are probably also helping lift confidence.\nThe  price  of regular unleaded gasoline at the pump decreased to\n$3.21 a gallon Dec. 20, its lowest since February, according to\nAAA, the biggest U.S. auto group.  Pier 1 Imports Inc. (PIR)  is among retailers seeing a pickup in\nsales at the start of the  holiday shopping season  without\nresorting to bigger price cuts.  \u201cSales are robust, merchandise margins are strong,\noperating margins are growing,\u201d Alexander Smith, president and\nchief executive officer at Pier 1, said on a Dec. 15 conference\ncall. Sales during the Thanksgiving weekend \u201cincreased 10\npercent from last year and were achieved with modest levels of\ndiscount.\u201d  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  posted quarterly profit that beat analysts\u2019\nestimates, helped by stronger demand for home delivery.  More Shipments  \u201cConsumer confidence remains at very low levels, but we\nhave seen improvement recently,\u201d Mike Glenn, executive vice\npresident for market development at  Memphis , Tennessee-based\nFedEx, said on a Dec. 15 earnings call. For 2012, \u201cwe expect\nU.S. GDP to grow 2.2 percent.\u201d  The economy grew less than previously estimated in the\nthird quarter, reflecting a smaller gain in  consumer spending ,\nrevised figures from the Commerce Department showed today. Gross\ndomestic product climbed at a 1.8 percent annual rate from July\nthrough September, down from the 2 percent estimated last month.  The index of leading economic indicators signals the\neconomy will strengthen.  The New York-based Conference Board\u2019s gauge of the outlook\nfor the next three to six months rose 0.5 percent after a 0.9\npercent October increase, the research group said today.  Cuts in  government spending  and failure by Congress to\nextend tax reductions represent clouds on the horizon. The U.S.\nHouse of Representatives rejected this week carrying over into\n2012 an expiring 2 percentage-point payroll tax cut and benefits\nfor the long-term unemployed. Should those measures not be\nprolonged, GDP growth next year will be cut by about 0.6\npercentage point, economists at IHS Global Insight estimate.
