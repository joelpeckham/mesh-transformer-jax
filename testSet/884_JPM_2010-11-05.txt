 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Economy: Payrolls Increase for First Time in Five Months' was published on 2010-11-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEmployment in the U.S. rose in\nOctober for the first time in five months, a sign businesses may\nbe starting to gain confidence in the prospects for a faster\npace of growth.  Payrolls climbed 151,000, exceeding all estimates in a\nBloomberg News survey of economists and following a revised\n41,000 drop the prior month that was smaller than initially\nestimated, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.\nPrivate payrolls expanded the most since April, while the\n jobless  rate held at 9.6 percent.  Stocks and the  dollar  climbed and Treasuries declined as\ngains in hours worked and earnings added to optimism that an\nimprovement in the labor market will boost household spending.\nFederal Reserve policy makers this week announced a second round\nof large-scale asset purchases in a bid to boost growth, even as\nrecent reports showed larger-than-forecast gains in retail sales\nand manufacturing.  \u201cBusiness is gradually starting to hire more,\u201d said\n Michael Feroli , chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in\nNew York. \u201cIncome is starting to grow for the household sector,\nwhich is good for consumer spending.\u201d  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index increased for a fifth\nstraight day, capping a five-week stock rally with a gain of 0.4\npercent to 1,225.85 at the 4 p.m. close of trading in New York.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to\nits price, rose to 2.54 percent from 2.49 percent late\nyesterday. The dollar strengthened to $1.4037 per euro from\n$1.4207.  \u2018Terrible Damage\u2019  President  Barack Obama  said today\u2019s employment report is a\nsign that the economy is recovering from the \u201cterrible damage\u201d\ncaused by the worst recession since the 1930s. Even so, \u201cthe\nunemployment rate is still unacceptably high,\u201d he said.  The loss of more than 8 million jobs, as a result of the\n18-month recession that ended in June 2009, fueled Americans\u2019\ndiscontent with the economy, a central issue in the Nov. 2\nelections that gave Republicans a majority in the House of\nRepresentatives. Democrats lost seats in the Senate while\nretaining control.  \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take a long time to bring the\nunemployment rate down to more acceptable levels,\u201d said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC in Stamford,\nConnecticut, who had the highest estimate for payroll gains at\n125,000.  Pending Home Resales  A report today from the National Association of Realtors\nshowed that pending sales of existing homes unexpectedly\ndeclined in September, a sign the housing market at the center\nof the crisis remains a weak spot for the economy. The group\u2019s\nindex of pending home resales dropped 1.8 percent after a\nrevised 4.4 percent gain the prior month.  The unemployment rate was forecast to stay at 9.6 percent,\naccording to the median prediction of 80 economists surveyed by\nBloomberg. Estimates ranged from 9.5 percent to 9.7 percent. The\nrate was 7.7 percent in January 2009, when Obama took office.  Employment at service-providers increased 146,000, the\nfirst gain since May. Construction companies added 5,000\nworkers, mainly reflecting stronger employment in civil\nconstruction. Manufacturing payrolls unexpectedly decreased by\n7,000 last month. Economists had projected a gain of 5,000.  Retailers took on 27,900 workers as they prepared for the\nholiday shopping season starting this month. Department store\nchain Kohl\u2019s Corp. had plans to hire about 40,000 people for the\nholiday period, 21 percent more than last year.  Toys \u201cR\u201d Us\nInc.  said it may add about 45,000 employees for the season,\nincluding 10,000 at its temporary stores.  Overall Payrolls  Overall payrolls, which increased for the first time since\nMay, were forecast to climb by 60,000, according to the survey\nmedian. The Labor Department revised up payrolls by 110,000 in\nSeptember and August. With the revisions, employment during the\ntwo months declined 42,000.  Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose\n159,000 in October after a 107,000 gain. Economists projected an\n80,000 increase, the survey showed.  Rockwell Collins Inc. , a Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based maker of\ncockpit instruments and radios, on Oct. 29 said it will hire 800\npeople, boosting staff by 4 percent during the next 12 months.\n Ford Motor Co. , the second-largest U.S. automaker, plans to add\n1,200 jobs in Michigan by 2013 as sales rebound.  Average hourly earnings increased 1.7 percent in October\nfrom the same month last year. Earnings rose to $22.73 from\n$22.68 in the prior month.  The average work week for all workers rose to 34.3 hours,\nfrom 34.2 hours.  Government Payrolls  Government payrolls decreased by 8,000. State and local\ngovernments reduced employment by 7,000, while the federal\ngovernment trimmed 1,000 jobs.  Fed policy makers this week announced a program of $600\nbillion in Treasury securities purchases through next June in a\nbid to lower the rate of unemployment. The central bank has\nalready cut  interest rates  almost to zero and bought $1.7\ntrillion in securities.  \u201cThe pace of recovery in output and employment continues\nto be slow,\u201d the Federal Open Market Committee said in a\nstatement on Nov. 3. \u201cEmployers remain reluctant to add to\npayrolls,\u201d and \u201cthe unemployment rate is elevated.\u201d  Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-\nMitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York, said the Fed may not need to\ncomplete the entire program of bond purchases if job growth\ncontinues at October\u2019s pace.  Interest Rates  \u201cJobs are picking up speed,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we need to\nsee is a little uptick in inflation, most likely next spring,\nand the Fed might need to start the process of normalizing\ninterest rates next year quicker than the market is\nanticipating.\u201d  Policy makers are concerned that a falling inflation rate\nincreases the risk of deflation, or a general fall in prices\nthat increases the burden of debt in real terms and erodes\ncorporate profits.  Today\u2019s report adds to signs the world\u2019s largest economy\nmay be picking up speed after growing at a 2 percent annual pace\nin the third quarter.  Retail sales climbed 0.6 percent in September, more than\nforecast. Services expanded in October at the fastest pace in\nthree months, while manufacturing grew at the strongest rate in\nfive months, according to reports this week from the Institute\nfor Supply Management.  Economists at Morgan Stanley in New York today raised their\ntracking forecast for U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter\nto 3.5 percent from 2.5 percent, in part because of the jobs\nreport.  \u2018Modest Expansion\u2019  \u201cThe October jobs report suggests that labor market\nconditions are improving,\u201d Morgan Stanley economists  David Greenlaw  and  Ted Wieseman  said in a note to clients.  \u201cWe\nbelieve this reflects a transition from a productivity-led\nrecovery to a modest expansion that is sustained by job and\nincome growth.\u201d  The underemployment rate -- which includes part-time\nworkers who\u2019d prefer a full-time position and people who want\nwork but have given up looking -- was little changed at 17\npercent after 17.1 percent in the prior month, today\u2019s report\nshowed. The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more\nincreased as a percentage of all jobless, to 41.8 percent.  The number of temporary workers increased 34,900. Payrolls\nat temporary-help agencies often slow as companies seeing a\nsteady increase in demand take on permanent staff.  Census Workers  Today\u2019s report was the first this year in which changes in\ntemporary government staffing for the decennial census played\nalmost no role. About 6,000 workers remained on the federal\npayroll as the population count wound down during the September\nemployment survey week, down from a peak of 586,000 in May.  One reason why hiring isn\u2019t increasing even more is the\neconomy\u2019s inability to sustain the recovery\u2019s early pace of\ngrowth. Gross domestic product expanded at an average 1.9\npercent annual rate in the six months ended in September,\ncompared with 4.4 percent in the previous two quarters.  Growth in the 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent range is\nconsistent with keeping the jobless rate stable, according to\nthe Fed\u2019s long-term forecasts.
