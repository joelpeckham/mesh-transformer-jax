The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHSBC Holdings Plc\u2019s (HSBA)  Islamic risk\nmanagement business posted double-digit growth last year on\nrising demand for Shariah-compliant hedging and investment\nproducts.  The bank has \u201cmore than 100 Islamic hedging and investment\nproducts, from about 10 products two and a half years ago,\u201d\nAbhishek Mishra, head of multi-asset structuring at HSBC Global\nBanking and Markets,  Middle East  and North Africa, said at a\nconference in Dubai. He forecasts similar growth in the bank\u2019s\nIslamic hedging and investment business in 2012.  While Saudi Arabia made up most of HSBC\u2019s business last\nyear, there has been growth among other Gulf Cooperation Council\nnations in 2012, Mishra said. The Islamic finance industry is\nforecast to more than double to $2.8 trillion by 2015, the Kuala\nLumpur-based Islamic Financial Services Board said. The six-\nnation GCC, including  Saudi Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates,\nhave a 25 percent share and  Malaysia  has 22 percent, Ernst &\nYoung said in a report this month.  Speculation is forbidden under Islamic law, and derivatives\nare limited to hedging. Derivatives are contracts whose value is\nderived from stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities, or\nevents such as  interest rates  or the weather.  The Manama, Bahrain-based  International Islamic Financial\nMarket  and the New York-based International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association published standards for Islamic profit-\nrate swaps in March.  \u201cHSBC has benefited from the global financial crisis,\nbecause as more foreign banks focus on their geographies and\ntheir existing products, we were able to take advantage of the\ngap,\u201d Mishra said. HSBC is the biggest underwriter of Islamic\nbonds this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
