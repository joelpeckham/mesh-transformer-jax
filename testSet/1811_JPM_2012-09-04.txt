The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBond yields in  developing countries \nincluding Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia are poised to increase as\n\u201crapid\u201d credit growth raises consumer default risk, according\nto General Re-New England Asset Management Inc.  \u201cBooms always appear sustainable at the time, but certain\nemerging countries show recognizable signs of\nunsustainability,\u201d GR-NEAM Chief Investment Officer John Gilbert wrote in a newsletter published on the website of the\nunit of  Warren Buffett \u2019s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  \u201cThe credit\ngrowth is merely a doubling up on an unsustainable burst of\ndemand, and must in time meet expectations of repayment.\u201d  The average yields on emerging-market dollar-denominated\nbonds tracked by JPMorgan Chase & Co. fell to a record low 4.83\npercent last month as falling U.S. Treasury yields prompted\ninvestors to seek alternatives for higher returns. Brazilian\ndollar-denominated  bonds  yielded 3.66 percent, or 1.79\npercentage points over Treasuries, JPMorgan data show.  Brazil \u2019s total  bank lending  has almost tripled to 2.2\ntrillion reais ($1.1 trillion) in July since the end of 2006,\nwith the consumer default rate rising to 7.9 percent, the\nhighest in almost three years, according to the central bank. In\nTurkey, the  current account deficit  reached a record 10 percent\nof its gross domestic product last year as cheap credit\nencouraged consumers to buy more than they produced. Indonesia\u2019s\ncurrent account surplus has turned into a deficit.  \u201cThe fearsome outcome is that growth slows as rising debt\nloads bite before deleveraging is complete in emerging\ncountries,\u201d Gilbert wrote. \u201cIn that event there are few growth\nengines left.\u201d  GR-NEAM had $67.7 billion in unaffiliated assets under\nmanagement as of March 31, according to its  website . The\nFarmington, Connecticut-based unit primarily serves insurers.
