The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe jury in the  insider-trading  case\nof Whitman Capital LLC founder Doug Whitman was told by a key\nwitness,  Roomy Khan , that Whitman \u201caggressively\u201d pressed her\nto pursue leaks from her sources, whom he referred to as Khan\u2019s\n\u201cmoles.\u201d  Khan, who has pleaded guilty to insider trading, testified\nfor a second day in the trial of Whitman, her former Atherton,\nCalifornia neighbor. Prosecutors say Whitman traded on tips from\nsources including Khan, who passed him illegal tips on  Google\nInc. (GOOG)  and  Polycom Inc. (PLCM) , and that he earned almost $1 million.  Khan said she got information about Polycom, the\nPleasanton, California-based maker of videoconferencing\nequipment, from a friend, Sunil Bhalla, a senior vice president\nand general manager of the company\u2019s voice division.  \u201cHe used to be always hounding me,\u201d Khan testified in\nManhattan federal court, referring to Whitman. \u201cCall Sunil,\ncall Sunil, call Sunil.\u201d At another point, Whitman told Khan,\n\u201cWhat value do you have if you\u2019re not a slime-ball?\u201d she\nadded.  Khan testified for a full day yesterday after spending 40\nminutes on the stand the day before. She told jurors she\nreceived inside tips from Bhalla and other sources, which she\nused to make money for herself and passed to friends and\nbusiness associates, including Galleon Group LLC fund manager\n Raj Rajaratnam .  Khan, a former Intel Corp. executive, pleaded guilty to\npassing confidential company information in 2001 and 2009. She\nplayed a crucial role in the government\u2019s probe of insider\ntrading at  hedge funds . Her evidence helped prosecutors get\nauthorization from a judge to tap Rajaratnam\u2019s mobile phone.  Preet Bharara   In another case tied to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet\nBharara\u2019s probe of insider trading, a judge ruled yesterday that\nWinifred Jiau, a former consultant for Primary Global Research\nLLC who is serving a four-year prison term, won\u2019t be released\nwhile her appeal is pending. Jiau was convicted at a trial last\nyear of passing along earnings and other information about\ncompanies including  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  She had asked to be released on\nbail while her appeal is pending.  Khan told jurors yesterday that she also passed Whitman\ntips on Google earnings, which she received from  Sunil Bhalla,\na former employee of Market Street Partners, an investor-\nrelations consulting firm that worked for the search-engine\ncompany.  In a telephone conversation with Whitman that Khan taped\nwhile she was cooperating with prosecutors, Whitman referred to\nKhan as \u201cMiss Google.\u201d The recording was played in court.  Khan said Whitman refused to use tips on impending\ncorporate acquisitions she said she got from Deep Shah, a former\nanalyst at Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  \u2018Go to Jail\u2019  \u201cMr. Doug Whitman said \u2018I don\u2019t want to have anything to\ndo with him,\u2019\u201d Khan testified. \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want to go to\njail.\u2019\u201d  In Rajaratnam\u2019s trial, prosecutors claimed that in 2007 the\nhedge fund manager traded on information from Shah, passed to\nhim by Khan, about Blackstone Group LP\u2019s planned takeover of\nHilton Hotels Corp.  Rajaratnam was found guilty in May 2011 of all 14 criminal\ncounts against him. He\u2019s serving an 11-year sentence in a\nMassachusetts federal prison and is appealing his conviction.\nKhan wasn\u2019t called to the stand in Rajaratnam\u2019s trial.  Khan Sentence  Khan pleaded guilty in 2009 to  securities fraud , conspiracy\nand obstruction of justice. She faces as many as 30 years in\nprison when she\u2019s sentenced, she told jurors.  In addition to the tips from Khan, prosecutors claim\nWhitman traded on nonpublic information about  Marvell Technology\nGroup Ltd. (MRVL) , which makes computer chips. Last week, Karl Motey,\nan independent consultant hired by Whitman, testified that he\npassed Whitman inside information from two Marvell employees.\nMotey has also pleaded guilty and is testifying in hopes of\navoiding prison, he told jurors.  Jurors yesterday heard a taped conversation of Whitman and\nKhan in which Whitman complained that Marvell management had\nplugged company leaks.  \u201cMarvell had leaks on information like a sieve,\u201d Whitman\nsaid on the tape. \u201cThey have worked to cut off information.\u201d  Yet, Whitman added, he retained some sources. \u201cI still get\nsome reasonable information,\u201d he said.  At day\u2019s end, defense attorney Dave Anderson spent about 45\nminutes questioning Khan about lies she told in a civil lawsuit\nbrought by her housekeeper in 2009.  Forged Document  Khan admitted that she forged a document to defend against\nclaims in the case, lied about it in a deposition, and then\nfiled a false declaration to support the forgery.  \u201cAll lies?\u201d Anderson asked her about the declaration.  \u201cYes,\u201d she said.  Anderson asked about Khan\u2019s leak of Intel documents to\nRajaratnam in 1997 and 1998, when she worked for the chipmaker.\n\u201cI was an overzealous person looking for a job,\u201d she said. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t think I was looking at the morality.\u201d  Anderson asked Khan how she got caught.  \u201cWhen?\u201d she asked.  Jurors laughed as Anderson clarified that he was talking\nabout the Intel leaks.  The case is U.S. v. Whitman, 12-cr-00125, U.S. District\nCourt, Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).
