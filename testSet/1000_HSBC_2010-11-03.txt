 "context": "The following article called 'Lloyds Names Santander's Horta-Osorio CEO, Replacing Daniels' was published on 2010-11-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLloyds Banking Group Plc , Britain\u2019s\nbiggest mortgage lender, named  Antonio Horta-Osorio  as chief\nexecutive officer, depriving Banco Santander SA of the executive\npreparing its U.K. division for an initial public offering.  The Portuguese national will replace  Eric Daniels  as Lloyds\nCEO on March 1, the London-based lender said in a statement\ntoday. Daniels, 59, led Lloyds\u2019 takeover of HBOS Plc in Sept.\n2008, a purchase that forced the lender to seek a 17 billion-\npound ($27 billion) government bailout.  Horta-Osorio, 46, led Santander\u2019s expansion in Britain\nduring the past two years, buying up Alliance & Leicester Plc as\nwell as parts of Bradford & Bingley Plc and  Royal Bank of\nScotland Group Plc  during the credit crisis, to add to the Abbey\nunit Santander acquired in 2004. The bank is preparing to sell a\nstake in its U.K. division in an IPO next year.  \u201cIt\u2019s now going to be difficult to proceed with the IPO,\u201d\nsaid  Andrea Williams , who helps manage about $1.1 billion at\nRoyal London Asset Management in London. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a\nsurprise. He\u2019s done a good job at Santander.\u201d  Ana Patricia Botin , daughter of Santander Chairman Emilio Botin , will succeed Horta-Osorio, according to two people\nfamiliar with the situation. Officials at the banks declined to\ncomment. She was previously chairman of  Banco Espanol de Credito\nSA .  Lloyds  gained  2.7 percent to 69.2 pence at the close of\ntrading in London, valuing the bank at 47.2 billion pounds.\nSantander, based in the Spanish city of the same name, dropped\n3.5 percent to 8.69 euros in Madrid.  \u2018Might Struggle\u2019  Santander \u201cmight struggle to IPO Abbey with an\nunfamiliar\u201d CEO,  Bruce Packard , an analyst at Seymour Pierce\nLtd. in London, wrote in a note to clients today. \u201cFrom a\nLloyds perspective, we think he is a credible external\nappointment.\u201d  Daniels said in September he would step down within 12\nmonths after the bank returned to profit. Lloyds yesterday\nforecast a \u201cgood\u201d financial performance for 2010. The lender\nposted a profit in the fiscal first-half, its first since the\nHBOS purchase.  Horta-Osorio joins a bank that\u2019s been shrinking following a\ntaxpayer-funded rescue. Lloyds has sold assets, among them its\nBank of Scotland Integrated Finance investment unit and cut more\nthan 22,000 jobs since its rescue. The bank still has to sell\n600 branches by 2013 to comply with European Union state aid\nrules. In all, Lloyds plans to shrink its balance sheet by 200\nbillion pounds by 2014.  Government Inquiry  At Lloyds, Horta-Osorio will also face a government inquiry\ninto competition among British lenders. The panel, led by  John Vickers , may decide to recommend breaking up some of Britain\u2019s\nbanks. Lloyds has a 28 percent share of the mortgage lending\nmarket following its takeover of HBOS.  He will also have to cut the lender\u2019s dependence on about\n120 billion pounds of central bank funding and oversee the\nreduction of the government\u2019s 41 percent stake in the lender,\nanalysts said.  \u201cWe have appointed a very well-qualified person to this\njob,\u201d Prime Minister  David Cameron \u2019s spokesman  Steve Field  told\nreporters in London. \u201cIt is in the taxpayer\u2019s interest that the\nbank is run well,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe will be able to turn around this bank into the next\nphase of its development and this will be good news for the\ntaxpayers, the employees and ultimately the U.K. economy,\u201d\nHorta-Osorio told reporters today.  Three New CEOs  Lloyds is the third of Britain\u2019s banks to name a new CEO in\nthe past two months.  Barclays Plc , Britain\u2019s third-biggest\nlender, said in September that American-born  Robert Diamond \nwould replace  John Varley . The same month, HSBC Holdings Plc,\nEurope\u2019s biggest bank, replaced CEO  Michael Geoghegan  with\n Stuart Gulliver .  Horta-Osorio began his career at Citibank in Portugal,\nwhere he was head of capital markets, according to Santander\u2019s\nwebsite. He worked for  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  in New York and\nLondon in corporate finance, and in 1993 joined Santander has\nhead of Banco Santander de Negocios Portugal.  He joined Abbey as a non-executive director in November\n2004 and became CEO of the division in August 2006. He is a\nmember of Santander\u2019s management committee.  Santander U.K. had a 19 percent share of mortgage lending\nin the third quarter and a 14 percent share of total mortgage\nstock. Santander, Spain\u2019s biggest bank, last week said it will\nmiss its 2010 earnings goal after bad loans caused its lowest\nquarterly profit in more than four years. Net income at Horta-\nOsorio\u2019s U.K. unit has doubled to 1.55 billion euros ($2.2\nbillion) in the first nine months of this year, compared with\n743 million euros in the same period of 2006.  \u2018Emotionally Difficult\u2019  The decision to leave Santander was \u201cemotionally very\ndifficult,\u201d Horta-Osorio said. \u201cThere is nothing about\nSantander that I have to say in any negative way.\u201d  Horta-Osorio will be taking a \u201cmajor reduction in his\ncompensation\u201d when he joins Lloyds, Chairman  Win Bischoff  told\njournalists in a conference call.  He will be given a package worth as much as 7.5 million\npounds including an annual salary of 1 million pounds, an annual\nbonus of as much as 225 percent of salary and a long term\nperformance-based share incentive of as much as 420 percent of\nsalary for 2011 that vests in three years. He\u2019ll also be\ncompensated for loss of deferred cash and shares and pension\nbenefits that he is forgoing at Santander. His U.K. salary and\nshort-term bonus at Santander is 3.4 million pounds, excluding\nperformance awards, said Bischoff.  His performance will also be judged against the bank\u2019s\nlending to \u201csmall and medium-sized\u201d businesses, Lloyds said.  Daniels was paid 1.12 million pounds last year, including a\nsalary of 1 million pounds, according to the bank\u2019s annual\nreport. He waived his bonus for the year.
