The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMarvell Semiconductor Inc., a Santa\nClara, California-based maker of semiconductors, prevailed in a\npatent-infringement case brought by a  Texas  patent holder.  A jury in federal court in Marshall, Texas, found that\nMarvell didn\u2019t infringe either of the two patents that were at\nissue in the case, according to an Aug. 16 court filing.  Lake Cherokee Hard Drive Technologies Inc. filed suit in\nJune 2010 against Marvell and seven other makers of computer\nchips. They were accused of infringing patents 5,978,162, issued\nin November 1999, and 5,844,728, issued in December 1998.  Both patents had previously belonged to  Cirrus Logic Inc. (CRUS) \nand then  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  before being acquired by Lake Cherokee\nin February 2010, according to the database of the U.S. Patent\nand Trademark Office.  Marvell was the only remaining defendant in the suit.  The case is Lake Cherokee Hard Drive Technologies LLC v.\nMarvel Semiconductor Inc., 2:10-cv-00216-JRG, U.S. District\nCourt, Eastern District of Texas (Marshall).  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  Dark Horse Brewery Sues Kansas Distillery Over Trademark  Dark Horse Distillery LLC, a Kansas-based maker of vodka,\nBourbon and rye whiskey, was sued for trademark infringement by\na Michigan brewery.  Mor-Dall Enterprises Inc., which does business as  Dark\nHorse Brewing Co. , objects to the distillery\u2019s name. According\nto the complaint filed yesterday in a Michigan federal court,\nDark Horse Brewing has done business since 1997.  The Marshall, Michigan-based company said it is presently\ninvolved in proceedings at the U.S. Patent and  Trademark Office \nin opposition to two pending trademark applications filed by the\ndistillery.  It said that despite the fact it had been in discussion\nwith the distillery in October and November over the \u201cDark\nHorse\u201d trademark application, the distillery filed additional\napplications in December and March, all of which contained\n\u201cDark Horse\u201d in the name.  The public is likely to be confused by the two companies\u2019\nname similarities, the brewery claimed.  The brewery asked the court to order the patent office to\nreject the distillery\u2019s pending applications, and to order the\nShawnee, Kansas-based company not to use any of the \u201cDark\nHorse\u201d marks. It also seeks awards of money damages, including\nthe defendant\u2019s profits derived from its alleged infringement,\nattorney feels and litigation costs.  Additionally, the brewery asked the court to order the\ndestruction of all products and promotional materials that\ninfringe or are confusingly similar to the brewery\u2019s trademarks.  Dark Horse Distillery didn\u2019t respond immediately to an e-mailed request for comment.  The case is Mor-Dall Enterprises Inc. v. Dark Horse\nDistillery, 1:13-cv-00915, U.S. District Court, Western District\nof  Michigan .  For more trademark news, click here.  Copyright  Romtec Sued by City of Portland Over Public Toilet Copyright  Romtec Inc., a company that produces bathroom facilities\nfor public spaces, was sued for copyright infringement by the\ncity of Portland,  Oregon .  The city claims that Roseburg, Oregon-based Romtec\ninfringed the copyright to a public toilet facility. According\nto court papers, the city invested public funds to create,\nfabricate, deploy, market and sell a distinctive public bathroom\nthat is known as the \u201cPortland Loo.\u201d  The Portland Loo is a toilet kiosk that can be placed on\ncity sidewalks that is handicapped accessible and can\naccommodate a baby stroller or a bike for the occupant. A novel\nfeature of the  Portland  loo is the use of louvered slats that\npermit natural surveillance by those outside the facility. The\nlouvers extend from knee level to foot level and just above head\nlevel to the ceiling, \u201cmaking activity inside somewhat visible\nto passersby,\u201d according to the complaint.  The Portland Loo was designed by one of the former city\ncommissioners, who then assigned the copyright -- which was\nregistered in 2008 -- to the city.  The Portland Loo has become such a distinctive and popular\ncreation of the city that it even has  its own Facebook page . The\ncity has seven Portland Loos installed around Portland, has sold\nthem two three other municipalities, and is negotiating to sell\nmore to the cites of  San Diego , Esquimalt, British Columbia, and\n Seattle , according to the complaint.  Romtec\u2019s \u201cSidewalk Restroom\u201d infringes the Portland Loo\ncopyright, as the Romtec product is \u201csubstantially and\nstrikingly similar\u201d to the Portland Loo and appears to be a\ncopy, the city said in its complaint.  The city also made claims under U.S. trademark law that the\ntwo facilities were so similar that the public was likely to be\nconfused as to their source and believe, falsely, that an\naffiliation existed between Romtec and the city.  It asked the court to bar Romtec from making and selling\nproducts that infringe the city\u2019s  intellectual property  rights,\nand to order the seizure and destruction of any infringing\nproducts or promotional materials.  The city also asked for awards of money damages, Romtec\u2019s\nprofits attributable to the alleged infringement, litigation\ncosts and money damages.  Romtec didn\u2019t respond immediately to an e-mailed request\nfor comment.  The case is City of Portland v. Romtec Inc., 3:13-cv-01453-MO, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon (Portland).
