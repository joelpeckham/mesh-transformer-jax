(AAPL)  signed an agreement with\n Sony Music Entertainment , the final record-company holdout\nneeded for the iPhone maker\u2019s planned online radio service, said\npeople with knowledge of the situation.  Sony signed its agreement late yesterday, and Apple plans\nto announce the service, unofficially dubbed iRadio, at a\nconference on June 10, said the people, who requested anonymity\nbecause the talks are private.  Vivendi SA (VIV) \u2019s Universal Music and\nLen Blavatnik\u2019s Warner Music Group have already signed\nagreements with Apple, people with knowledge of the situation\nsaid this month.  With the  record companies  on board, Apple plans to announce\nan advertising-supported service that will compete with  Pandora\nMedia Inc. (P)  for listeners. IRadio will allow users to build\ncustom stations based on an artist or genre that draws on music\nfrom the company\u2019s iTunes library.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, rose 0.8 percent to\n$441.81 at the close in New York and is down 17 percent this\nyear. Oakland, California-based Pandora -- which today reported\n70.8 million active listeners at the end of May, a 33 percent\njump from the same period a year earlier -- rose 5.7 percent to\n$15.12 and has gained 65 percent this year.  Apple\u2019s agreement with  Sony Music  was reported earlier\ntoday by AllThingsD. Sony/ATV Music Publishing, a joint venture\nof  Sony Corp. (6758)  and the estate of  Michael Jackson , signed its\nagreement with Apple today, Chief Executive Officer Marty Bandier said in an interview.  Two-Year Deal  Sony/ATV\u2019s deal with Apple covers a two-year introductory\nperiod and provides the New York-based company with 10 percent\nof all advertising revenue generated from its music catalog, the\nbiggest in the world, Bandier said. That\u2019s more than double the\ncurrent standard 4 percent rate in digital music publishing\nagreements, he said.  \u201cThis is a wonderful recognition of songwriters and their\ncontributions to hit records,\u201d Bandier said. \u201cFor so long they\nhave received the short end of the stick.\u201d  The radio service will be free to customers and supported\nby ads, people with knowledge of the offering said earlier this\nmonth. By integrating the service with iTunes, users will be\nable to buy and download songs that are played, they said.  Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president in charge of the\neffort, has retooled the company\u2019s iAd mobile-advertising unit\nto focus on selling audio ads and attracting large brands to the\nservice, people familiar with the plans have said. The\nadvertising revenue will be shared with the music companies.  More Downloads  Apple has pitched the service to music companies as a tool\nfor boosting downloads of songs through iTunes. As more people\nlisten to music for free through services such as Pandora and\nGoogle Inc.\u2019s YouTube, Apple sees the service as a way to turn\npeople on to new music. Services such as Spotify Ltd. and Rdio\nInc., which charge a monthly fee for unlimited access to their\nsong libraries, also have gained traction.  Apple remains the world\u2019s biggest music retailer,\nrepresenting 63 percent of the download market, according to\nestimates from NPD Group Inc.
