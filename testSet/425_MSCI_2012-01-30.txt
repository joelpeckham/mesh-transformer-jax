The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAviva Plc (AV/) , Britain\u2019s second-biggest\ninsurer by market value, will cut 160 jobs at its asset\nmanagement unit as the European sovereign debt crisis and the\ndeteriorating U.K. economy crimp sales.  The insurer will scale back its funds that actively select\nstocks to focus instead on its fixed income, real estate and so-\ncalled multi-asset investment funds, Aviva said in a statement\ntoday. The cuts, equivalent to 12 percent of Aviva Investors\u2019\nworkforce, include the company\u2019s London-based European, emerging\nmarkets, global, and sustainable and responsible investments\nequity desks. The insurer will retain its equity index team.  \u201cThe economic downturn has been the catalyst for a change\nin client behavior across the asset management sector, with a\nreduced appetite for riskier assets such as equities, notably in\n Europe ,\u201d Aviva said.
