 "context": "The following article called 'MetLife Wins Fed Extension to Resubmit Capital Plan' was published on 2012-06-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life\ninsurer, got more time to submit a fresh capital plan to the\n Federal Reserve  as the firm seeks to raise its dividend and\nresume buybacks after being twice blocked by the regulator.  The deadline was moved to Sept. 30 from June 12, the New\nYork-based insurer said in a regulatory filing today.  \u201cThis is basically an acknowledgment by the Fed saying,\n\u2018Look, we understand you\u2019re an insurance company, we understand\nyou\u2019re not going to be a  bank holding company ,\u2019\u201d said  Steven Schwartz , an analyst at Raymond James & Associates. The time\nextension \u201clikely negates any need to possibly raise or build\ncapital any further.\u201d  Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian , 60, has been\nselling banking assets to reduce oversight from the Fed, which\nweighs the capital plans of the largest lenders, such as\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. Kandarian said in March that the insurer\nwould no longer have bank status by the end of June, a\nprediction he declined to reiterate in April.  MetLife gained 3.2 percent to $30.36 at 9:40 a.m. in New\nYork. The insurer has  slumped  2.7 percent this year compared\nwith the 7.5 percent gain for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  The firm has kept its annual dividend at 74 cents a share\nsince 2007. Prudential Financial Inc., the second-largest U.S.\nlife insurer, lifted its annual payout in 2009, 2010 and 2011.\nThe  Newark , New Jersey-based company isn\u2019t subject to the same\nFed scrutiny.  Fed Review  The Fed has been reviewing how 19 of the nation\u2019s largest\nlenders would fare in a severe economic slump. MetLife,\n Citigroup Inc. (C) , SunTrust Banks Inc. and Ally Financial Inc.\u2019s\ncapital plans were rejected in the regulator\u2019s latest round of\nso-called stress tests in March.  Citigroup retreated this month from an effort to win Fed\napproval to boost payouts to shareholders this year. CEO Vikram Pandit, 55, had vowed in March to seek approval for a\n\u201cmeaningful\u201d payout after the New York-based firm\u2019s initial\nsubmission for 2012 was rebuffed.  Pandit scrapped Citigroup\u2019s dividend in 2009 after the bank\nalmost collapsed and took a $45 billion bailout from U.S.\ntaxpayers. The lender has since repaid the rescue funds, and\nlast year it resumed a 1-cent quarterly payment.
