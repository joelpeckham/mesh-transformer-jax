The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nReliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India\u2019s\nbiggest company by market value, posted the sharpest decline in\nquarterly profit in more than three years after refining margins\nnarrowed amid slowing global economic growth.  Net income  fell 21 percent to 42.4 billion rupees ($814\nmillion), or 12.9 rupees a share, in the three months ended\nMarch 31 from 53.8 billion rupees, or 16.4 rupees, a year\nearlier, the Mumbai-based explorer and refiner said in a stock\nexchange filing yesterday. The  median estimate  of 30 analysts\ncompiled by Bloomberg was a profit of 42.8 billion rupees.  A slowdown in  China\u2019s economy  and  Europe \u2019s prolonged debt\ncrisis cut gasoline and diesel demand, adding to the drag on\nReliance\u2019s earnings from lower production at India\u2019s biggest\nnatural gas deposit. Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh\nAmbani , has gained 5.5 percent this year, trailing the 12\npercent increase in the benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index.  \u201cLower gas output and refining margins have pulled down\nprofit again,\u201d said Kamlesh Kotak, vice president of research\nat Asian Markets Securities Pvt. in  Mumbai . \u201cInvestors will be\nlooking closely at when they will increase gas output. That\nholds the key.\u201d  The  shares  fell 1.5 percent to 730.85 rupees in Mumbai\nyesterday, giving Reliance a market value of $46 billion. The\nearnings were announced after trading closed.  The consensus analyst  rating  for Reliance is the most\nbearish since January 2011, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co.  downgraded  the stock to\nunderweight this month, Standard Chartered Plc cut it to \u201cin-\nline\u201d from outperform last month and Royal Bank of Scotland\nGroup Plc reduced to hold from buy in February.  Refining Margin  The company reported a profit of $7.6 for every barrel of\ncrude it processed into fuels in the quarter, compared with $9.2\na barrel a year earlier, according to the statement.  Reliance operates the world\u2019s largest refining complex,\nconsisting of two adjacent plants that can turn a combined 1.24\nmillion barrels of crude into fuels daily. Crude-processing\naccounts for almost 65 percent of its revenue.  The facility at Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat\nhas the capability to turn cheap, low-grade crude into high-\nvalue fuels. A narrowing difference between lighter  crude oil ,\nwhich is expensive, and heavier varieties that are cheaper,\nhurts Reliance\u2019s earnings.  Brent crude  in London trading gained 11 percent this year.\nThe June contract $1.16, or 1 percent, to $119.16 a barrel as of\n10:57 a.m. New York time yesterday.  Light, Heavy Oils  The  average difference  between light Brent crude oil and\nheavier Dubai oil was $2.23 a barrel in the quarter ended March\n31, compared with $4.93 a year earlier, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The spread was $2.62 a barrel in the\npreceding quarter.  Profit from turning Dubai crude into diesel in Singapore, a\nregional benchmark, averaged $16.81 a barrel in the quarter,\ncompared with $18.49 a barrel a year earlier and $18.22 in the\npreceding quarter, according to data from PVM Oil Associates\nLtd., a London-based crude and refined-products broker. It fell\nto a 15-month low of $14.45 a barrel on April 13.  Reliance\u2019s refining profit was also hurt by lower\nproduction because of a shutdown in February, Credit Suisse\nGroup AG analyst Sanjay Mookim said in an April 17 report. The\ncompany shut a crude distillation unit at the newer 580,000\nbarrel-a-day facility for three weeks in the quarter.  Reliance had cash and equivalents of 702.5 billion rupees\nas of March 31, according to the statement, boosted by the sale\nof stakes in oil and gas fields to  BP Plc. (BP/)  Total debt was 682.6\nbillion rupees.  Gas Field  The company sold a 30 percent stake in 21 fields, including\nthe KG-D6 deepwater block in the Bay of Bengal, to London-based\nBP last year for $7.2 billion.  Reliance\u2019s gas output from KG-D6, the nation\u2019s biggest,\nfell 23.5 percent in the year ended March 31, according to the\nstatement. Daily output, which peaked at about 60 million cubic\nmeters in June 2010, has dropped because of technical\ndifficulties in the reservoir, Reliance said.  \u201cOperationally, they aren\u2019t doing well at all,\u201d said K.\nRavichandran, the Chennai-based co-head of corporate ratings at\n ICRA Ltd. (ICRA) , the local affiliate of Moody\u2019s Investors Service.\n\u201cThe positive thing is they have more cash than debt and that\nmeans on the debt side, they won\u2019t have any problems.\u201d  The  Chinese economy expanded  8.1 percent in the first\nquarter this year, the slowest pace since the second quarter of\n2009. The government in March cut the growth target to 7.5\npercent for this year, after keeping it at 8 percent in the\nprevious seven years.  Oil prices  have moved for more than two years on\ndevelopments in the euro region\u2019s debt crisis and its projected\nimpact on the continent\u2019s energy demand. The crisis that began\nin  Greece  has spread to Ireland,  Portugal ,  Italy  and  Spain .
