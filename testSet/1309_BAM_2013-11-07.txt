 "context": "The following article called 'Brookfield Bets on Wind With $7 Billion Fund' was published on 2013-11-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrookfield Asset Management Inc. (BAM/A) \nplans to invest in South American wind farms and hydroelectric\nplants to benefit from a burgeoning middle class after raising\n$7 billion in the world\u2019s second-biggest infrastructure fund.  Canada \u2019s biggest manager of  alternative  assets completed\nfundraising last week for its closed-end infrastructure pool,\nraising 40 percent more than targeted from more than 60 pension-fund managers, insurance companies and institutions, including\nSun Life Financial Inc.  \u201cWe like the investment attributes in  South America ,\u201d Sam Pollock, chief executive officer of Brookfield\u2019s infrastructure\ngroup, said in an Oct. 30 telephone interview. Brazil\u2019s\nrenewable-energy industry is \u201cone we know well and in which we\ncan make future investments.\u201d  The Toronto-based company, which has invested in\ninfrastructure for at least a century, will allocate 40 percent\nof the Brookfield Infrastructure Fund II to projects in  North\nAmerica . A portion of the remaining funds will be used for\nhydroelectric power plants and wind farms in South American\ncountries including Brazil,  Peru ,  Colombia  and  Chile .  Infrastructure assets are \u201cvery long-term, have very\nsteady cash flows -- the perfect asset for a pension fund or an\ninstitutional investor,\u201d said  Jim Hall , chief investment\nofficer of Calgary-based Mawer Investment Management Ltd., which\noversees more than C$16 billion ($15.4 billion), including\nBrookfield shares. \u201cWhy Brazil? Because there\u2019s big demand.\u201d  Largest Economy  Brazil\u2019s gross domestic product will expand 2.45 percent\nthis year and in 2014, according to the average estimate of 38\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg. The largest economy in South\nAmerica recorded its slowest two-year pace of growth in more\nthan a decade in 2011 and 2012. Policy makers have raised the\ncountry\u2019s key interest rate more than any other country tracked\nby Bloomberg this year as an annual inflation rate of 5.75\npercent in mid-October undercuts  consumer confidence  and\nthreatens business spending.  Even with those headwinds, demand for energy investments\nhas ballooned. A record 929 power projects registered last month\nto participate in a Dec. 13 auction for contracts to sell\nelectricity. Wind farms made up 47 percent of the projects, and\nnatural-gas plants 22 percent, according to energy-research\nagency Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica. Other projects include\nsolar and hydro plants.  \u201cAs the economy grows, electricity demand grows, and the\ncompanies need to supply that,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnd these supply\ncompanies need a bunch of capital. Brookfield and its partners\nare providing that capital.\u201d  Hydro Market  Electricity consumption in the country  jumped  42 percent\nbetween 2000 and 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration.  Brazil  \u201ctends to be a hydroelectric market and that\u2019s\nwhere most of our focus has been,\u201d Pollock said. The country is\n\u201clooking to broaden the load to be spread across different\ntechnologies, not just hydro, so we\u2019ve started to look at wind\nin that market.\u201d  Brookfield\u2019s Brazilian unit is also in exclusive talks with\nVale SA, the world\u2019s third-largest mining company, to buy about\n26 percent of Vale\u2019s VLI SA, a cargo logistics operator. Vale\nowns railways, ports and terminals that span the country,\ntransporting commodities from wheat to steel.  \u201cWe\u2019re currently looking at Vale\u2019s logistics business in\nBrazil, which is a large rail and port opportunity,\u201d Pollock\nsaid. Any infrastructure transaction Brookfield makes would be\nfor the new fund, he said. The fund is the largest\ninfrastructure-investment vehicle after Global Infrastructure\nPartners, which raised $8.25 billion last year, according to\nLondon-based research firm Preqin Ltd.  Rising Income  Brookfield\u2019s net income rose to $802 million in the second\nquarter, up 112 percent from a year earlier. Asset-management\nfees, which the company charges clients to manage funds such as\nthe new one, rose 72 percent. The firm\u2019s shares have  gained  more\nthan 100 percent in the past five years, outpacing the 47\npercent advance for the 46-company Standard & Poor\u2019s/TSX\nFinancials Index. Brookfield was little changed at C$41.69 at\n10:24 a.m. today in Toronto.  \u201cOnce fully invested, the fund will increase Brookfield\u2019s\nannual third-party fees by over $50 million annually,\u201d   Michael Goldberg , an analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc. in Toronto,\nsaid in an Oct. 30 phone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s a big increase. On\ntop of that, they get incentive fees. These are the numerical\nimpacts. The other impact is the increased profile that it gives\nBrookfield as an asset manager.\u201d  Brookfield\u2019s  Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund (INF) , a\nclosed-end fund with total assets of $238 million, had a 23\npercent return last year, compared with 19 percent for its\npeers.  Two Acquisitions  Brookfield, which  received  a quarter of its revenue from\nasset-management services last year, has already made two\npurchases, worth $600 million, for its fund: Entergy Solutions\nDistrict Energy Ltd., a company that provides heating-and-cooling services to businesses in  New Orleans  and Houston, and\nWhite Pine Hydro LLC, a portfolio of hydroelectric facilities in\n Maine  and  New Hampshire .  Infrastructure assets may lure fewer investors, such as\nCanada\u2019s pension funds and insurers, as  interest rates  increase.\nThe high yield offered by infrastructure may not be as\nattractive once other investments start offering similar\nreturns.  \u201cWhat\u2019s the demand for this type of product four or five\nyears from now, when interest rates have normalized?\u201d said Hall\nof Mawer Investments. \u201cIs it still the same? That\u2019s an open\nquestion.\u201d  Regulatory Changes  Investing in any emerging market also carries the risk of\nthe country nationalizing assets or changing regulations in way\nthat hurts companies, Hall said. Buying renewable-energy assets\nin Brazil also has logistical challenges.  \u201cWith wind projects, you tend to have data that tends to\nbe spotty and the technology around turbines continues to\nevolve,\u201d Pollock said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an industry that\u2019s been\nmaturing and, whenever you go into new regions, it just takes\nsome time for people to get it right. This is a continuation of\nour progress as an asset manager.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nKatia Dmitrieva in Toronto at \n edmitrieva1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDavid Scanlan at \n dscanlan@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. was 15.548908233642578 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. was ",
