The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) \u2019s creditors\nshould have some priority to be repaid by the bankrupt estate,\nsaid Chapter 11 trustee  Louis Freeh , citing intercompany loans\nmade between the failed parent and its operating unit.  Freeh, representing the interests of creditors of the\nparent company, commented on the legal principles that will\ngovern repayments in papers filed late yesterday in  Manhattan \nbankruptcy court. Former customers of the broker-dealer unit,\nseeking an estimated $1.2 billion missing from their accounts,\nare being repaid in a related case overseen by a different\ntrustee, James Giddens, appointed under the Securities Investor\nProtection Act.  The holding company has \u201csubstantial intercompany claims\u201d\nagainst the broker-dealer unit on account of former intercompany\nloans, and any recoveries of that money shouldn\u2019t be\n\u201cdiverted\u201d to customers, giving them a priority at the expense\nof creditors of the parent company, Freeh said.  Freeh is concerned that \u201can inappropriate interpretation\u201d\nof the law may lead Giddens to deny the rights of creditors to\nrecover from property that was never deposited by them, lawyers\nfor Freeh wrote.  Customer Pool  The conflict is \u201cnot whether certain estate property can\nbe distributed to customers, but whether estate assets that\nwould otherwise be available for distribution to MF Global\nInc.\u2019s creditors can be reallocated to the customer pool,\u201d\nFreeh said.
