(BBY) , the world\u2019s largest\nconsumer-electronics retailer, will exit  Europe  by selling its\n50 percent stake in a mobile-phone venture to partner  Carphone\nWarehouse Group Plc (CPW)  for 500 million pounds ($775 million).  Best Buy will receive 420 million pounds in cash and 80\nmillion pounds in the U.K. company\u2019s stock, the Richfield,\nMinnesota-based retailer said today in a statement. Carphone\nWarehouse shares surged as much as 15 percent, the most ever.  Best Buy Chief Executive Officer Hubert Joly, who took\ncharge in September, is evaluating the retailer\u2019s foreign units\nto free up cash and resources in his effort to revive U.S.\nstores hurt by competition from Amazon.com Inc. and Wal-Mart\nStores Inc. Best Buy generates about 25 percent of its revenue\nfrom operations in Europe,  China  and  Canada .  \u201cThis transaction allows us to simplify our business,\u201d\nJoly said in the statement. It also strengthens Best Buy\u2019s\nreturn on invested capital and balance sheet, he said.  Best Buy projected revenue of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion\nin Europe this fiscal year, with adjusted per-share earnings\n\u201cexpected to be immaterial.\u201d  Best Buy advanced 3 percent to $24.20 yesterday in  New York \ntrading.  The shares  have more than doubled this year, trailing\nonly  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  in the Standard & Poor\u2019 500 Index. The index\nhas gained 12 percent.  European Withdrawal  The European withdrawal \u201cshould not suggest any similar\naction in our other international businesses,\u201d Joly said.  Best Buy\u2019s international segment posted an operating loss\nof $881 million in the fiscal year ended Feb. 2 on revenue of\n$12.8 billion. Sales totaled $49.6 billion companywide.  Best Buy formed the Best Buy Europe joint venture with\nLondon-based Carphone Warehouse in 2008 and they now operate\nstores in eight countries.  The companies also are terminating a venture that sells\nlaptops, tablets and mobile phones outside of Europe and  North\nAmerica . Best Buy said it will pay Carphone Warehouse 29 million\npounds to satisfy obligations from that venture.  Today\u2019s gain in Carphone Warehouse shares was the steepest\nsince the company listed in  London  in March 2010. The stock was\nup 13 percent at 230 pence as of 11:39 a.m., the highest price\nin about three months.  Share Sale  The U.K. retailer said it will sell 47.2 million new shares\nto help fund the cash element of the purchase price. The shares\nwill likely be priced between 220 pence and 230 pence apiece,\naccording to an e-mailed update sent by banks to clients and\nobtained by  Bloomberg News .  Chairman Charles Dunstone and executive directors \u201cintend\nto participate\u201d in the share offer, according to the statement.  Under the terms of the deal,  Carphone Warehouse  will also\npay a deferred cash amount of 50 million pounds, split equally\nbetween the first and second anniversaries of completion.  \u201cWe believe Carphone Warehouse has paid an extremely good\nprice,\u201d Citigroup Inc. analyst Assad Malic said in a report.\n\u201cThis now means that Carphone Warehouse can apply for a premium\nlisting and FTSE Index inclusion over time.\u201d  Carphone Warehouse also said fourth-quarter same-store\nsales rose 6.5 percent in the period ended March 31, beating\nCitigroup\u2019s estimates. Growth was driven by the U.K. business.  The retailer said it is withdrawing from France, where\nmarkets are \u201cparticularly challenging.\u201d The exit will be\nachieved with a mixture of store disposals and closures and will\ncost as much as 90 million pounds, it said.
