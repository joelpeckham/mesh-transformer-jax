The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGerman government bonds advanced on\nspeculation central banks around the world are preparing to\nloosen monetary policy after the Bank of Japan unexpectedly\nlowered interest rates yesterday.  Two-year yields were at the lowest in almost a week as\nGermany sold 4.1 billion euros ($5.7 billion) of the securities.\nIrish bonds fell relative to German bunds after the nation\u2019s\ncredit grade was cut one level by Fitch Ratings. Japan\u2019s central\nbank said yesterday it will expand its balance sheet, following\nthe U.S. Federal Reserve in moving toward more unconventional\neasing. European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  may\nsignal tomorrow whether emergency measures designed to support\nbanks through the financial crisis will be removed.  \u201cBunds benefit from quantitative easing in the U.S.,\nregardless of what the ECB does,\u201d said  Padhraic Garvey , head of\ndeveloped markets debt at ING Groep NV in Amsterdam. \u201cAssuming\nthe ECB doesn\u2019t pursue QE, that can stress the euro-zone\neconomy, which is also good for bunds.\u201d  Ten-year bund yields were 5 basis points lower at 2.23\npercent as of 2:57 p.m. in London. The 2.25 percent security due\nSeptember 2020 rose 0.475, or 4.75 euros per 1,000-euro face\namount, to 100.15. Two-year yields were 4 basis points lower at\n0.77 percent.  Bunds extended gains as ADP Employer Services said U.S.\ncompanies unexpectedly cut 39,000 workers in September, the\nbiggest drop since January. The median estimate of 37 economists\nsurveyed by Bloomberg News called for a gain of 20,000.  \u2018Liquidity Injections\u2019  \u201cThe ECB\u2019s liquidity injections were their version of\nquantitative easing, so it\u2019s going to be very interesting to see\nwhat Trichet has to say about them tomorrow,\u201d said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European rates strategy at Royal Bank of\nCanada Europe Ltd. Shorter-dated German debt \u201cwill be the most\nresponsive to the ECB, while bunds are being influenced more by\nthe cross markets and they\u2019ve been well supported.\u201d  Irish 10-year  bond yields  rose 12 basis points relative to\nbunds for a yield spread of 422 basis points. Ireland was cut to\nA+ from AA-, reflecting the \u201cexceptional and greater-than-\nexpected cost\u201d of the nation\u2019s bailout of its banking system,\nFitch said in a statement today.  The move comes a day after Moody\u2019s Investors Service said\nthe country\u2019s rating may be cut. Ireland said last week the cost\nof repairing its financial system may rise to as much as 50\nbillion euros ($69 billion), pushing its budget deficit this\nyear to a record 32 percent of gross domestic product.  Debt Auctions  \u201cNo one is going to change their fundamental view on\nIreland because of this downgrade, however, the news of the\ndowngrade itself always has the ability to catch people off-\nguard,\u201d said  Mohit Kumar , a fixed-income strategist at Deutsche\nBank AG in London. \u201cSpreads will be volatile.\u201d  Greek 10-year bonds rose  relative  to benchmark German bunds\neven as the European Commission said it will revise the nation\u2019s\ndebt and deficit figures, citing \u201careas of uncertainty.\u201d The\nbonds yielded 767 basis points more than bunds, from 773 basis\npoints yesterday.  Germany sold the 0.75 percent notes maturing in 2012 at an\naverage yield of 0.76 percent attracting bids worth 2.2 times\nthe amount offered, the Bundesbank said. The nation also sold 1\nbillion euros of 1.75 percent 10-year inflation-linked bonds at\nan average yield of 0.57 percent, attracting bids worth 2.2\ntimes the amount offered.  Portuguese Demand  Portugal sold 500 million euros of 3-month bills at an\naverage yield of 1.595 percent, and 500 million euros of 12\nmonth-bills at an average yield of 3.333 percent.  The auctions garnered increased demand, with the securities\ndue in January attracting bids for 3 times the amount offered,\ncompared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.5 at a similar sale in\nAugust. Bidders for the September 2011 securities sought 2.8\ntimes the amount offered, compared with the previous ratio of\n1.6. Portugal sold all 1 billion euros of securities that the\ndebt agency, the IGCP, said it planned to issue.  The auction \u201cwas very well received, as demand was very\nstrong,\u201d said  Chiara Cremonesi , a strategist at UniCredit SpA\nin London. \u201cThis is remarkable given the market isn\u2019t very\npositive about Portugal right now.\u201d  German  factory orders  surged 3.4 percent in August from a\nmonth earlier, more than the 0.9 percent median estimate of 36\neconomists in a Bloomberg survey.  German bonds returned 9.2 percent this year, compared with\n9.1 percent for U.S. Treasuries and 9.7 percent for U.K. gilts,\naccording to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European\nFederation of Financial Analysts Societies.
