 "context": "The following article called 'J&J\u2019s Ekdahl Says Hip Recalled for Clinical Reasons' was published on 2013-03-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAndrew Ekdahl, president of  Johnson\n& Johnson (JNJ) \u2019s DePuy orthopedic products unit, told a Chicago jury\nthat the company recalled 93,000 hip implants in August 2010\nbecause they weren\u2019t meeting \u201cclinical expectations.\u201d  Ekdahl\u2019s testimony came on the third day of a state court\ntrial in which Carol Strum, 54, claims her ASR XL hip was\ndefective. Strum, an Illinois nurse, had the all-metal device\nimplanted in 2008, and she had it replaced three years later in\na so-called revision surgery. Strum\u2019s lawsuit is the second of\n10,750 over the ASR hips to go to trial.  \u201cThe revision rate was not acceptable,\u201d Ekdahl testified.\nThat was the reason for the recall, he said.  J&J recalled the ASR after saying 13 percent failed within\nfive years in the U.K., requiring revisions. Ekdahl was asked\nabout a DePuy document signed by top company officials days\nbefore the recall. The document, from the Health Hazard/Risk\nEvaluation Review Board, listed three possible explanations for\nthe recall. DePuy checked Class A for \u201cdefective product that\nwould affect product performance and/or could cause health\nproblems.\u201d  In his opening statement on March 13, J&J attorney Richard\nSarver said the device was not defective.  \u2018Many Factors\u2019  \u201cMany factors contribute to the overall revision rate so a\nsingle root cause cannot be defined at this time,\u201d Sarver said.\n\u201cWe absolutely didn\u2019t say the product is a defective product.\nWe said, \u2018We don\u2019t know. We need to figure this out.\u2019\u201d  To say the recall \u201cis an admission of a defect, it is\nabsolutely absurd,\u201d according to Sarver.  A Los Angeles jury last week found that the ASR was\ndefective and awarded $8.3 million to a Montana man in the first\nhip-implant case to go to trial against DePuy, a unit of  New\nBrunswick , New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson. J&J is the\nworld\u2019s largest seller of health-care products.  In his opening statement, Strum\u2019s attorney Denman Heard\ntold jurors that the ASR design flaws caused it to shed chromium\nand cobalt debris into surrounding tissue. Surgeons implanted a\nmetal cup in the hip and a metal ball, placed atop the femur,\nrotated inside the cup. DePuy claimed its design would last\nlonger than other products.  \u201cBefore Carol Strum ever had the ASR put into her body,\nDePuy knew that the design flaws in this defective device could\ncause it to shed those particles into patients, causing tissue\ndeath, causing high blood metal ion levels and the need for the\nserious and unnecessary second surgery,\u201d Heard said.  The case is Strum v. DePuy, 2011-L-9352, Circuit Court of\nCook County, Law Division (Chicago).
