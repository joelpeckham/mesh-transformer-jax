 "context": "The following article called 'Medicare Rate Decision Came Two Weeks Before Announcement' was published on 2013-04-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Obama administration decided\nMarch 15 to scale back a proposed cut in Medicare payments to\nhealth insurers, two weeks before the information may have been\ntipped to stock traders, according to Senator  Charles Grassley .  Grassley, an Iowa Republican who has been investigating\nwhether lobbyists obtained confidential government information,\nsaid events suggest the rate decision may have been known to\npeople outside of the Medicare agency long before an analytics\nfirm released an April 1 report speculating on the decision.  \u201cA significant number of people likely knew what the\noutcome would be long before the decision was announced,\u201d\nGrassley said in an e-mail today. \u201cIt seems unlikely that none\nof them hinted at it to anyone else for more than two weeks.\u201d  The timeline of events was pieced together after a Height\nAnalytics LLC report on April 1 told clients that the Obama\nadministration would reverse plans to cut payment rates for\nMedicare Advantage plans sold by private insurers. The report\nbeat by more than 40 minutes the official government\nannouncement, sending the shares of  Humana Inc. (HUM) ,  UnitedHealth\nGroup Inc. (UNH)  and other insurers soaring.  Marilyn Tavenner , the acting administrator of the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, described the government\u2019s\ntimeline leading up to the payment decision in an April 19\nletter that Grassley released today.  Mark Hayes, a  Greenberg Traurig  LLP lobbyist, discussed the\npossibility of a rate change in an April 1 e-mail sent to Height\nAnalytics, a Washington-based investor firm that provides\nanalysis and information about government decisions. In turn,\nHeight advised its clients in a memo that day about the policy\nchange.  Height has said it did nothing wrong. Greenberg Traurig\nsaid it, too, hadn\u2019t found evidence of any illegal activity,\nthough it plans to stop doing work with so-called political\nintelligence firms.  Medicare Advantage plans are those offered by private\ninsurers with different benefits and costs than the traditional\nMedicare health coverage for the elderly and disabled. The\ngovernment sets the rates the insurers are paid.
