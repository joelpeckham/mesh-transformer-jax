 "context": "The following article called 'Onyx Wins Backing of FDA Advisory Panel for Cancer Drug' was published on 2012-06-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOnyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX)  gained the\nmost in five years after winning support from a U.S. advisory\npanel for its drug to treat a deadly blood cancer that affects\n50,000 Americans.  Onyx jumped 43 percent to $63.78 at the close in New York,\nthe biggest single-day increase since Feb. 12, 2007. The shares\nhave gained 78 percent in the past 12 months.  Ligand\nPharmaceuticals Inc. (LGND) , which has an  agreement  to explore an IV\nversion of the drug, increased 13 percent to $16.49.  Food and Drug Administration  advisers voted 11 to 0, with\none abstention, that the benefits of Onyx\u2019s multiple myeloma\ntreatment, called carfilzomib, outweigh its risks. If approved\nby the agency, annual sales may be  $523 million  in 2016,\naccording to the average of five analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by\nBloomberg, more than doubling the South San Francisco-based\ncompany\u2019s $447 million  revenue  last year.  \u201cThis is an unmet need in a group that has really run out\nof options,\u201d said  Wyndham Wilson , the panel chairman and chief\nof lymphoma therapeutics at the  National Cancer Institute .\n\u201cThere is a pretty convincing signal here that is likely, I\nbelieve, to be confirmed in confirmatory trials.\u201d  The agency, scheduled to make a decision by July 27, isn\u2019t\nrequired to follow the recommendation of the panel, which met\nyesterday in  Silver Spring , Maryland. Onyx applied for\naccelerated approval of the treatment based on the second of\nthree phases of trials typically needed for market clearance.  Tumors Shrunk  The medicine, with the proposed name Kyprolis, shrunk\ntumors in 22 percent of multiple myeloma patients, which may not\noffer enough of an advantage in light of the side effects,  FDA \nstaff said in a June 18  report .  Five patients died from heart ailments, the agency said. If\napproved, annual sales for the drug may be  $523 million  in 2016,\naccording to the average of five analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by\nBloomberg, more than doubling Onyx\u2019s $447 million  revenue  last\nyear.  \u201cThis is an incredibly important step in the company\u2019s\ngrowth trajectory,\u201d  Michael King , an analyst with Rodman &\nRenshaw in  New York , said in an e-mail. \u201cThis is a much better\ndrug than the Street has been giving them credit for.\u201d  The panel\u2019s recommendation, \u201cis an important regulatory\nmilestone,\u201d Ted Love, executive vice president of research and\ndevelopment at Onyx, said yesterday in a statement. \u201cOnyx is\ncommitted to bringing Kyprolis to patients as quickly as\npossible and looks forward to working closely with the FDA as\nthe agency completes its review.\u201d  Side Effects  Side effects for the treatment included cardiac arrest,\nchest pain, pneumonia and shortness of breath, the FDA staff\nsaid. More than 70 percent of patients had lung complications\nwith the drug, according to the FDA report.  Carfilzomib would be used to treat  multiple myeloma \npatients who have first tried  Celgene Corp. (CELG) \u2019s Revlimid and\n Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (4502) \u2019s Velcade.  About 50,000 people in the U.S. are living with the disease\nand 20,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. About 11,000\npatients die of the blood cancer annually, according to the\nNational Cancer Institute.  Ligand, a drugmaker based in  La Jolla , California, had\ngained 37 percent in the 12 months before today.
