The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia\u2019s Labor government\nremains committed to putting a price on carbon and developing\nclean energy even as its emissions-trading legislation heads for\nfailure, Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said today.  \n Opposition from the Greens party and the Liberal-National\ncoalition, \u201cspelled the end of legislation in this\nParliament,\u201d Ferguson told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.\nPutting a price on carbon and supporting investment in clean\nenergy \u201care still clearly government priorities.\u201d  \n The plan to cut carbon output by 5 percent was twice\nblocked in Australia\u2019s upper house Senate, creating a possible\ntrigger for an early election. It also split the opposition,\nleading to the resignation of Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull,\nwho staked his position on a deal struck with Prime Minister\nKevin Rudd to support the climate-change bill.  \n Support for Rudd, who must call a general election within a\nyear, declined two percentage points to 54 percent, according to\nan April 20 poll published by the Australian newspaper. Tony\nAbbott, the opposition leader, saw backing for his coalition\nrise a similar amount to 46 percent, according to the survey.  \n The failure of the carbon-trading plan comes almost four\nmonths after some 190 countries failed to agree on a binding\ngreenhouse gas treaty at United Nations talks in Copenhagen.  \n High Emissions  \n Rudd\u2019s climate plan would have taxed companies with high\nemissions like energy, steel and cement makers and offset the\ncharges with free emissions permits and financial compensation.\nThe assistance package would have cost the government A$20\nbillion ($18.5 billion), the Grattan Institute, a Melbourne-\nbased think-tank, said in a report on April 22.  \n The government \u201cis clearly trying to get climate off the\nagenda before the election,\u201d Greens Senator Christine Milne\nsaid in an e-mailed statement today. \u201cEither the prime minister\nwas not genuine when he said climate change was the great moral\nchallenge of our time, or he lacks the courage\u201d to take action.  \n While deferring action on carbon trading to their next term\nin office, if elected, the government will release a review of\nthe nation\u2019s taxation system on May 2 that aims to simplify\ncentral, state and local government duties.  \n The 10-year plan drawn up by Treasury Secretary Ken Henry,\nwho oversees Australia\u2019s A$1.21 trillion ($1.1 trillion) economy,\nreviewed \u201call of our tax system, not just the business tax\nsystem, not just the income tax system, but also the taxation\nsystem in the states,\u201d Treasurer Wayne Swan, who commissioned\nthe report two years ago, told Sky News on April 25.  \n Mining Companies  \n Mining companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto Group\nthat currently pay royalties to state governments and a 30\npercent tax on profits may face increased contributions.  \n The level of taxes is \u201cclearly an issue that the\ngovernment will have to consider post-Sunday,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of who collects the tax it\u2019s the amount of\ntax collected that determines the investment horizons of\nAustralia.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nMarion Rae in Canberra at \n mrae3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was 49.6268310546875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was ",
