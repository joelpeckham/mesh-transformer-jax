 "context": "The following article called 'Glaxo Said to Pay More Than $250 Million to Settle Avandia Death Lawsuits' was published on 2011-02-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGlaxoSmithKline Plc  agreed to pay\nmore than $250 million to resolve about 5,500 claims related to\nits  Avandia  diabetes drug and avoid the first trial over claims\nit can kill users, two people familiar with the accords said.  Glaxo, the U.K.\u2019s biggest drugmaker, agreed to settle the\nlawsuits claiming the drug causes heart attacks and strokes for\nan average of at least $46,000 each, said the people, who\ndeclined to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to\nspeak publicly.  The accords included a previously reported settlement of an\nundisclosed amount for the family of James Burford, an Avandia\nuser who died in 2006. The Burford family\u2019s case, filed in\nfederal court in Philadelphia, was set for trial last week.  \u201cAn average of $46,000 per case is a modest price to pay,\nin the grand scheme of things,\u201d  Gbola Amusa , an analyst at UBS\nAG in London, said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf Avandia\ndefinitively had caused heart attacks, Glaxo would have been\nforced to pay\u201d as much as $1 million a case, he said.  The cases settled were filed by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers  Joseph\nZonies  and  Thomas Cartmell . Glaxo was facing about 2,000 suits\nalleging the drugmaker hid Avandia\u2019s heart-attack and stroke\nrisks prior to the settlements, lawyers for former users and the\ncompany said in court hearings. The company already agreed to\npay about $460 million to resolve allegations it didn\u2019t properly\nwarn doctors and consumers about the medicine\u2019s risks.  European Sales Halted  Mary Anne Rhyne, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Glaxo,\ndeclined to comment on the settlements. Zonies, of Denver, and\nCartmell, of  Kansas City ,  Missouri , didn\u2019t immediately return\ncalls seeking comment.  The company said Sept. 23 it would stop promoting Avandia\nworldwide after regulators said the treatment would be withdrawn\nfrom the market in  Europe  and sales would be limited in the U.S.\nbecause of studies linking the drug to increased risks of heart\nattacks.  Avandia sales fell 43 percent to $710 million last year in\nthe wake of the sales restrictions, the company said. Avandia\nwas once the world\u2019s best-selling diabetes pill, generating $3\nbillion in annual sales.  Glaxo said Jan. 17 it\u2019s taking a $3.5 billion charge to\ncover expenses linked to investigations and suits over Avandia.\nThe reserve brings to $6.4 billion the amount the drugmaker has\nset aside in the past year for legal costs tied to Avandia.  GlaxoSmithKline officials said today they\u2019ve updated\nAvandia\u2019s warning label to include safety restrictions ordered\nby federal regulators, who cited studies showing the drug poses\nan increased risk of heart attack and stroke for some users.  10,000 Cases  The label now warns users that the drug is only intended\nfor consumers who can\u2019t control their blood-sugar levels with\nother diabetes drugs, according to an e-mailed statement from\nthe company.  Glaxo officials agreed in July to resolve about 10,000\nAvandia cases, which they said was the majority of claims over\nthe drug at the time.  Publicity about those accords brought in another wave of\nsuits over the drug, said the people familiar with the\nsettlement of the Zonies and Cartmell cases.  The lawyers were appointed by U.S. District Judge Cynthia Rufe in Philadelphia to lead a group steering the progress of\nmore than 1,600 cases consolidated in that court. London-based\nGlaxo is facing another 400 claims in state courts across the\ncountry, according to a September court filing.  The Zonies and Cartmell settlement included some cases that\nhaven\u2019t yet been filed under an agreement with Glaxo, the people\nfamiliar said. Such pacts, known as  \u201ctolling agreements,\u201d  are\ncommon in mass-tort cases.  Shares Rise  Trial was slated to begin Jan. 31 in federal court in\nPhiladelphia in the Burford family\u2019s case.  Burford, an electrical-parts salesman, took Avandia for 15\nmonths to treat diabetes before having a fatal heart attack in\nhis North Carolina home, according to court filings. He was 49\nat the time of his death.
