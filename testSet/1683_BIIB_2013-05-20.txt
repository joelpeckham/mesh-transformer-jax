 "context": "The following article called 'Royalty Pharma Raises Elan Bid to $12.50 a Share in Cash' was published on 2013-05-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRoyalty Pharma, an investor in\nroyalty streams from pharmaceuticals, raised its offer to buy\n Elan Corp. (ELN)  by 12 percent to $6.4 billion after the Irish\ndrugmaker made acquisitions to boost revenue and resist the bid.  The all-cash offer of $12.50 per American depositary\nreceipt is higher than a previous bid of $11.25 per ADR and\ncompares with the $11.67 closing price on May 17.  Pablo Legorreta, Royalty\u2019s founder and a former Lazard\nbanker, is pursuing the Dublin-based company after Elan Chief\nExecutive Officer Kelly Martin, a former Merrill Lynch & Co.\nbanker, initially offered to buy Royalty. Elan\u2019s board, which\nunanimously rejected New York-based Royalty\u2019s previous takeover\nbid on April 22, will assess today\u2019s announcement and advise\nshareholders, the company said today in a statement.  \u201cIn the meantime, Elan shareholders are strongly advised\nto take no action in relation to the Royalty Pharma offer,\u201d the\ncompany said.  Elan rose 3.2 percent to $12.04 at the close in New York.\nThe company said today it plans to buy back $200 million in\nshares, with details to be announced. Elan last month bought\nback $1 billion in stock, reducing the number of shares\noutstanding to about 510 million.  Martin\u2019s Strategy  An acquisition by Royalty would allow Elan shareholders to\navoid the risks of Martin\u2019s strategy of reinvesting the $3.25\nbillion Elan received from  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)  for  divesting  its\nstake in the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri, Royalty said. Elan\nhas said it will pay investors dividends directly linked to\nTysabri sales as a 20 percent share of the royalty received from\nBiogen.  Elan this month announced a $1 billion investment in\n Theravance Inc. (THRX) \u2019s royalties, a $340 million takeover of Vienna-based AOP Orphan Pharmaceuticals AG and the purchase of a 48\npercent stake in Dubai-based NewBridge Pharmaceuticals for $40\nmillion. The company also plans to issue $800 million in debt.  Elan has \u201cdramatically overpaid\u201d in the Theravance deal\nby agreeing to spend $1 billion on 21 percent of a portion of\nroyalties when all of South San Francisco, California-based\nTheravance was trading at $3.5 billion, Royalty said in a\nstatement. Today\u2019s increased offer is contingent on Elan\ninvestors voting against the Theravance transaction and all\ndeals announced today that are put to a vote, Royalty said.  Hasty Deal  \u201cThe Theravance transaction public disclosure suggests\nthat the transaction was pursued in haste and without critical\nconfidential information which could significantly impair the\nvalue of the asset,\u201d Royalty said. \u201cRoyalty Pharma expects\nthat the same may be true of the transactions announced today.\u201d  In addition, Elan\u2019s board can\u2019t recommend Royalty Pharma\u2019s\noffer at any price without breaching its agreement with\nTheravance, thereby compromising its ability to freely advise\nits shareholders and making itself \u201cirrelevant\u201d to them,\nRoyalty said.  Royalty\u2019s offer is \u201cfully financed, cash confirmed and not\nconditional on due diligence,\u201d the company said. Royalty also\nsaid it reserved the right to waive down the acceptance\nthreshold for the increased offer from 90 percent to 50 percent\nplus one Elan share.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Groton\nPartners are advising Royalty Pharma. Elan\u2019s financial advisers\ninclude Davy Corporate Finance, Morgan Stanley, Ondra Partners\nand Citigroup Inc.  Founded in 1996, Royalty Pharma owns royalty interests in\n38 approved and marketed pharmaceutical products. For example,\nin 2004, the firm bought Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer\nCenter\u2019s U.S. royalty interest in Amgen Inc.\u2019s Neupogen drug.
