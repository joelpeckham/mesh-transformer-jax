The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSpirit Aerosystems Holdings Inc. (SPR) , the\nBoeing Co. supplier that\u2019s been a focus of takeover speculation,\nsaid it\u2019s selling its production sites in  Oklahoma  and is\nreviewing other potential divestitures.  Spirit has held talks with potential buyers for the sites\nin Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, and will consider all offers,\nexecutives said today on a conference call, without naming them.\nThe company also hired a banker it didn\u2019t identify, according to\na statement today.  The shares pared  declines  of as much as 8 percent after\nexecutives on the call said they\u2019re looking at other facilities\nto sell. In May, Chief Executive Officer Larry Lawson said\nSpirit would review programs in Tulsa as well as Wichita,\n Kansas , where the company is based; Kinston, North Carolina; and\nSt. Nazaire in  France .  The Tulsa site is \u201ca very attractive asset and we expect\nsome really good dialogue with a number of potential buyers,\u201d\nChief Financial Officer Philip Anderson said on the call. The\nTulsa facility represents as much as 14 percent of the company\u2019s\n$3 billion year-to-date  revenue , he said.  Earlier today, Spirit delayed its quarterly earnings report\nbecause auditors haven\u2019t completed their review.  Spirit dropped \n3 percent to $25.01 at the close in New York, paring its gain\nfor this year to 47 percent.  Spirit\u2019s Charge  Spirit has struggled with its own suppliers on capacity and\ncosts as planemakers worldwide boost output. The company said it\nwill record a pretax charge of $350 million to $400 million tied\nto work for  General Dynamics Corp.\u2019s (GD)  Gulfstream business-jet\nunit, and is limiting draws on its credit facility until 2014\u2019s\nlast three months. No default event has occurred, Spirit said.  Standard & Poor\u2019s cut its outlook for Spirit to negative\nfrom stable, saying the costs for the Gulfstream planes will\nkeep credit ratios from improving this year. Spirit\u2019s BB debt\nrating, two steps below investment grade, was left unchanged,\nS&P said.  The stock jumped 5.7 percent on July 25 after the U.K.\u2019s\nDaily Mail said  GKN Plc (GKN)  was readying a takeover bid for about\n$35 a share. No such offer has been made public, and CEO Nigel Stein declined on a conference call last week to comment on any\ninterest in the U.S. company.  Spirit makes components for all of Boeing\u2019s current lineup\nof commercial jets, including the 787 Dreamliner, according to\nthe company\u2019s website. While Spirit also supplies Airbus SAS,\nBoeing accounts for about 84 percent of sales,  data compiled  by\nBloomberg show.  Supply Chain  Divesting Spirit\u2019s Oklahoma assets won\u2019t affect the supply\nchain at Boeing, said  Howard Rubel , an analyst at Jefferies LLC.\nHe rates Spirit as buy.  \u201cOne would believe that Boeing is very much involved with\nstrategic decisions of a major supplier,\u201d Rubel said by phone\nfrom New York. \u201cThey would be very much focused on ensuring a\nsmooth transition from one owner to another owner.\u201d  Spirit said it plans to reschedule its second-quarter\nfiling, where it will report revenue of $1.52 billion, an\nincrease of 13 percent from a year earlier.
