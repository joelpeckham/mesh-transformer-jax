 "context": "The following article called 'Standard Bank Outshone by Smallest of \u2018Big Four\u2019 on Growth' was published on 2012-09-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStandard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) ,  Africa \u2019s largest bank, is falling behind the smallest of South Africa\u2019s so-called big four,  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , after its failed attempt to expand in  emerging markets  eroded profit margins.  Standard fell 1.4 percent in the five years through 2011 as it expanded from Johannesburg to  buy assets  in  South America  and Russia. During that same period, Nedbank gained 38 percent as it pursued an alliance with  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , which operates in more African countries than any other bank.  Standard, whose  market value  of 166 billion rand ($20 billion) is double that of Nedbank, began selling assets outside Africa last year. Profit contracted at an annual 1.7 percent in the past five years, compared with Nedbank\u2019s 0.7 percent growth.  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  and Barclays Plc\u2019s  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  make up the other members of South Africa\u2019s \u201cbig four\u201d banks.  \u201cProblems arose when Standard cast its net wider to the likes of  Argentina  and Russia,\u201d Johann Scholtz, head of research at Johannesburg-based Afrifocus Securities, said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhat was stark in recent results was that the South African franchise is excellent, but the rest of the group is operating at or below the cost of capital.\u201d  Climbing Costs  Without the cost of expansion and continued investment across 16 African countries that Standard Bank is paying for, Nedbank has entered new markets in  South Africa , boosted customer numbers and built on its strategy to earn fees from non-banking activities. Standard Bank\u2019s  cost-to-income  ratio worsened to 59 percent from 51.4 percent in the past five years, while Nedbank\u2019s is little changed at 56 percent.  Through Lome, Togo-based Ecobank, Nedbank also has access to 36 African countries with more than 2,000 outlets. It also has the option to take a stake of as much as 20 percent in Ecobank.  \u201cNedbank did great in retail by restructuring the business and refocusing on vehicle finance, unsecured lending and the mass market,\u201d Patrice Rassou, who helps oversee about $40 billion as head of equities at Sanlam Investment Management in  Cape Town , said in an e-mailed response to questions. The potential to expand the alliance with Ecobank is a \u201cclever way to gain exposure to multiple countries,\u201d he said.  Standard is \u201cgaining meaningful traction\u201d outside of South Africa, although costs are still high, according to Erik Larsen, a company spokesman. The bank\u2019s first-half operating expenses climbed to 19.2 billion rand from 16.3 billion rand a year earlier, outstripping the 15 percent rise in income from banking activities.  Chinese Stake  Standard Bank  gained funds after  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China\u2019s  purchase of a 20 percent stake in 2008 and making acquisitions \u201cseemed like a good idea at the time,\u201d said Stephen Meintjes, head of research at stockbroker Imara S.P. Reid. \u201cManagement can be credited with not persisting overly long with South America and Russia. With hindsight, it might have been better simply to focus on Africa.\u201d  To properly compare Standard Bank and Nedbank, the two stock prices and the \u201chuge difference\u201d in market value would need to be compared over a longer time frame, Larsen said.  ICBC, as the Chinese bank is known, last year agreed to pay $600 million for assets controlled by Standard in Argentina. Standard said it was making a profit of about $217 million on the sale. The African lender also sold its stake in  Russia \u2019s Troika Dialog in 2011 for $372 million, having paid $300 million for a stake in 2009. In April, it sold 53 percent of Turkish broker and investment bank Standard Unlu.  \u2018Benefited Financially\u2019  \u201cStandard Bank has benefited financially from the disposals,\u201d Jenny Knott, chief executive officer of Standard Bank Plc, said in an interview in  London  on Sept. 6. \u201cThe reality is that there was no choice\u201d but to sell amid increased protectionism, she said.  There is some evidence from the interim results that Standard\u2019s African portfolio is recovering, according to Greg Saffy, a banking analyst at RMB Morgan Stanley in Johannesburg. At the same time, Standard\u2019s change in strategy destroyed  shareholder value  and came at an opportunity cost, he said.  Standard is the second-worst performing stock after Absa on the six-member FTSE/JSE Africa Banks Index this year, having added 2.8 percent compared with the average gain of 10 percent.  The  bank  fell 1.9 percent to close at 102.40 rand in Johannesburg, its lowest closing price in eight months. Nedbank, which has risen 17 percent this year, dropped 1.7 percent to 171.54 rand.  \u201cMost business models were shattered by the crisis,\u201d David Munro, head of corporate and investment banking for Standard Bank, said in an interview in London on Sept. 6. \u201cOur business model has fundamentally changed. It\u2019s impossible to say \u2018yes there was an opportunity cost\u2019 because circumstances and the world are so fundamentally different.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Renee Bonorchis in Johannesburg at  rbonorchis@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Dale Crofts at  dcrofts@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was 23.246959686279297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was ",
