 "context": "The following article called 'CFTC Should Appeal Ruling on Speculation Limits, Chilton Says' was published on 2012-10-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission should appeal a federal judge\u2019s decision blocking\nDodd-Frank Act limits on speculation in oil, natural gas and\nother commodities, said Commissioner Bart Chilton.  The CFTC should also seek a stay of U.S. District Judge\nRobert Wilkins\u2019s Sept. 28 ruling that the agency failed to\nassess whether limits were necessary and appropriate under the\n2010 regulatory overhaul, Chilton said in remarks prepared for a\nspeech tomorrow in Rome at the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the  United Nations .  \u201cThe struggle isn\u2019t over,\u201d said Chilton, one of three\nDemocrats on the five-member commission. \u201cI think the court\nopinion is deeply flawed.\u201d  The court decision stymied rules from taking effect Oct. 12\nthat were challenged by the Securities Industry and Financial\nMarkets Association and International Swaps and Derivatives\nAssociation Inc. The associations represent  JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (JPM) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and other banks\nand energy trading firms.  The agency should start drafting another version of the\nrule to account for the judge\u2019s objections, Chilton said. The\nagency should issue an interim final rule with a 15-day period\nof public comment, he said.  \u201cWe already know what most folks think,\u201d Chilton said.\n\u201cThis would allow us to quickly do what we had planned.\u201d  In his ruling, Wilkins said the law requires the CFTC to\nfind that limits are necessary before imposing them.  \u201cThe Dodd-Frank amendments do not constitute a clear and\nunambiguous mandate to set position limits, as the commission\nargues,\u201d Wilkins wrote.
