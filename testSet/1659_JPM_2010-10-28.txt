 "context": "The following article called 'Anglo Irish Creditors `Gambling' on Improved Debt-Swap Offer' was published on 2010-10-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAnglo Irish Bank Corp.  bondholders\nplan to block a proposed debt exchange that imposes losses of\nmore than 1.3 billion euros ($1.8 billion) as they seek to force\nthe nationalized lender to improve the offer.  Creditors holding a 690 million-euro \u201cblocking position\u201d\nof notes will vote against the deal worth 20 percent of their\n1.6 billion euros of securities, according to a statement from\nHoulihan Lokey which is advising investors. The extra yield\ndemanded to hold Irish 10-year bonds over German debt rose by\nabout 20 basis points to 443 basis points today, approaching the\nrecord 449 basis points last month.  Ireland faces a bill of more than 50 billion euros to prop\nup its banks and is seeking to ensure the losses of lenders it\nowns outright are shared with subordinated noteholders. Finance\nMinister  Brian Lenihan  has said he will legislate to allow the\ngovernment to impose penalties on subordinated creditors while\nmaking senior investors whole.  \u201cBondholders are gambling the government is willing to pay\nup and doesn\u2019t want to use the draft legislation to impose\nlosses,\u201d said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Evolution Securities\nLtd. in London. Imposing losses \u201chas a knock-on impact on other\nbanks, it creates uncertainty and raises the question of what\nthe government is willing to do in extreme situations.\u201d  No Negotiations  Anglo Irish Chairman  Alan Dukes  said today he won\u2019t\nnegotiate with subordinated bondholders who are opposing the\nexchange. Dukes, a former finance minister, was speaking in\nDublin.  The government also owns Irish Nationwide Building Society,\nwhere bondholders are also opposing enforced losses.  Ray Gordon, outside spokesman for Ireland\u2019s National\nTreasury Management Agency, which manages certain bank oversight\nfunctions for the state, declined to comment. An official at the\nDepartment of Finance also wouldn\u2019t comment.  Opposition to the proposals is undermining confidence in the\ncreditworthiness of the government and the nation\u2019s other banks.\nCredit-default swaps on Irish sovereign debt jumped 21 basis\npoints to 465, the highest level in a month, according to data\nprovider CMA. Contracts on Allied Irish Banks Plc bonds rose 8.5\nbasis points to 629.5.  Credit-default swaps insuring 10 million euros of Anglo\nIrish\u2019s subordinated debt for five years fell to 6.98 million\neuros in advance and 500,000 euros annually from 7.07 million\neuros upfront, according to CMA.  Anglo Irish subordinated bonds due 2014 rose 0.71 cent to\n20.8 cents on the euro, according to pricing data compiled by\nBloomberg.  Exchange Penalty  The lender has said that bondholders who don\u2019t accept the\nterms of the debt exchange will be given 1 cent per 1,000-euro\nface amount.  The challenge by investors risks ending up in court,\nespecially if no consensus is reached and new legislation is\nintroduced, said  Simon Adamson , an analyst at CreditSights Inc.\nin London.  \u201cIf bondholders are determined to challenge this, it could\nbe quite a long, drawn-out situation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis goes\nagainst the general thrust of regulation right now, which is all\nabout getting bondholders to share losses. There doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe much upside, except for the lawyers.\u201d  The exchange of the lower Tier 2 notes will generate a\ncapital gain of about 1.26 billion euros that the bank can use\nto bolster its capital ratios, according to analysts at Barclays\nCapital in London. A repurchase of more-junior so-called Tier 1\ndebt that was also announced this month, will generate a gain of\n347 million euros, the analysts said.  The bondholder meetings to approve the exchange must have a\nminimum attendance of holders of 66 percent of the notes, 75\npercent of whom must agree to the changes, according to JPMorgan\nChase & Co., which is managing the offer.  Martha Kavanagh, an outside spokeswoman for Anglo Irish,\nsaid the bank was unable to comment while the exchange offer was\nopen.
