 "context": "The following article called 'BrightSource Approved for Two of Five California Solar Contracts' was published on 2012-10-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCalifornia approved today two\nproposed power-purchase agreements for  BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) \nsolar projects and rejected three that regulators said were too\nexpensive.  The California Public Utilities Commission approved\nunanimously the Oakland, California-based solar company\u2019s deals\nto sell power to  Edison International (EIX)  from its Rio Mesa 2 and\nSonoran West projects, and denied proposals for its Rio Mesa 1\nand Siberia 1 and 2 plants.  BrightSource develops solar-thermal systems, which focus\nthe sun\u2019s energy to heat a boiler and drive a steam turbine. The\ntechnology generally is more expensive than photovoltaic panels,\nthe most common solar system, and regulators said the projects\nthey approved included capabilities, such as storage, that\npanels can\u2019t provide.  \u201cStorage significantly improves the value\u201d of solar-\nthermal systems, CPUC President  Michael Peevey  said at today\u2019s\nmeeting. \u201cRatepayers\u2019 long-term interest will be best served in\nmy view by beginning to invest now in advanced technologies.\u201d  The Sonoran West project in Riverside County is expected to\nbegin delivering power to Southern California Edison in 2017,\naccording to a commission  filing . It features a vat of molten\nsalt that retains heat and lets the system generate electricity\nfor several hours after the sun has set.  \u2018Necessary Precursor\u2019  Rio Mesa 2, also in Riverside County, doesn\u2019t have storage\nand was approved because it includes technical advances that are\nconsidered \u201ca necessary precursor\u201d to developing solar-thermal\nsystems that do use molten salt, Peevey said. It\u2019s expected to\nbe complete in 2015.  Energy storage will be necessary to meet  California \u2019s goal\nof getting 33 percent of its energy from renewable sources by\n2020, commissioner Michel Florio said.  \u201cThe Sonoran West project gives us this extremely valuable\ntechnology that is really what we\u2019re going to need in the\nfuture,\u201d Florio said.  The CPUC rejected the Rio Mesa 1 contract because it\n\u201ccompares poorly on price and value,\u201d regulators said. The\nSiberia 1 and 2 projects included storage and were denied due to\n\u201cuncertainty regarding transmission availability\u201d that would\nrequire costly upgrades. The proposed electricity prices that\nthe utility would pay for power weren\u2019t disclosed.  Rio Mesa \u201cwill continue to move forward as planned,\u201d\nKristin Hunter, a BrightSource spokeswoman, said today by e-\nmail. \u201cThe Siberia project will remain a part of BrightSource\u2019s\n90,000 acre site portfolio.\u201d  Edison International\u2019s Southern California Edison utility\nhas agreed to buy about one-third of the output from\nBrightSource\u2019s 377-megawatt Ivanpah project in San Bernardino\nCounty, which is almost 60 percent complete.  BrightSource has seven additional contracts with  PG&E\nCorp. (PCG) \u2019s Pacific Gas & Electric utility to deliver 1,310\nmegawatts of capacity from multiple projects, including about\ntwo-thirds of Ivanpah\u2019s output.
