The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n(Corrects  David Rockefeller \u2019s role at JPMorgan in seventh\nparagraph of story published Aug. 16.)  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is seeking to\nsell 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, the lower Manhattan tower built by\nDavid Rockefeller in the late 1950s, as the company reduces its\n office space  in the city.  The bank would relocate about 4,000 employees, most of the\npeople who work in the 60-story skyscraper, to other New York\nlocations, said  Brian Marchiony , a spokesman. JPMorgan occupies\nabout half of the space in 2.2 million-square-foot (204,000-square-meter) building, according to  CoStar Group Inc. (CSGP) , a\nWashington-based firm that follows office leasing.  An offering of the tower, a city landmark designed by\narchitect Gordon Bunshaft, would test the  downtown office\nmarket . Shrinking financial companies have left lower Manhattan\nlandlords with at least 6.3 million square feet of space to\nfill, according to data from brokerage Newmark Knight Frank\nGrubb. The tower may achieve its highest value as a mixed-use\nproperty, with a hotel, additional retail or apartments added,\nsaid  Dan Fasulo , managing director of Real Capital Analytics\nInc., a New York-based research firm that tracks commercial real\nestate sales.  \u201cYou could do a department store in the base,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting potential mixed-use opportunity, in my\nmind. I think the market will receive it very well.\u201d  The building may fetch at least $600 million, according to\na person with knowledge of the offering. The cost to buyers\nwould be higher because they would assume any conversion\nexpenses, said the person, who asked not to be identified\nbecause the discussions are private.  2009 Offering  Other tenants include the law firms Milbank Tweed Hadley &\nMcCloy LLP, with 337,000 square feet, and Hawkins Delafield &\nWood LLP, with 66,000 square feet, according to CoStar.  The tower was once the headquarters of Chase Manhattan\nBank. Rockefeller, as head of the bank\u2019s building committee,\nselected the site and oversaw its construction.  Chase bought JP Morgan & Co. in 2001. The building was\noffered for sale in 2009 and pulled off the market later that\nyear, when Manhattan office buildings lost almost 47 percent of\ntheir value in the wake of the credit crisis.  The bank also owns or leases offices at its headquarters at\n270 Park Ave., 245 and 277 Park Ave., 4  New York  Plaza downtown,\nMetroTech Center in Brooklyn and the Newport office complex in\n Jersey City , New Jersey.  The plan to sell the building was reported earlier today by\nCrain\u2019s New York Business.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDavid M.
