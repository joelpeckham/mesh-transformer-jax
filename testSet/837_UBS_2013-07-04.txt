 "context": "The following article called 'Gold Sales Tumble at Perth Mint After Rout Deters Buyers' was published on 2013-07-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGold sales from  Australia \u2019s Perth\nMint, which refines nearly all of the bullion mined in the\ncountry, declined for a second month in June as prices extended\na bear-market slump, deterring buyers.  Sales of gold bars and coins totaled 49,460 ounces in June,\ncompared with 92,781 ounces in May and 116,755 ounces in April,\naccording to data from the  mint . Sales were 52,704 ounces in\nMarch, before the rout, the data show.  The slowdown adds to signs that while gold\u2019s plunge\ndeepened over the second quarter as prices fell to the lowest\nsince August 2010, a buying frenzy seen in April wasn\u2019t repeated\nlast month. Bullion lost 23 percent in the three-month period\namid speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will curb its asset-buying program as the  U.S. economy  recovers. Bullion may drop to\n$1,050 over 12 months as haven demand wanes, UBS AG said today.  Buyers increased purchases in April \u201cbut in May and June\nhave realized that prices are still coming down and it\u2019s not\ndoing as well,\u201d Ron Currie, sales and marketing director at the\nmint, said in a phone interview from Perth. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting to\nsee how the market goes.\u201d  Bullion for immediate delivery was little changed at\n$1,252.19 an ounce at 3:58 p.m. in  Singapore . Prices tumbled 11\npercent in June after dropping 6 percent in May and 7.6 percent\nin April. Analysts at banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc. trimmed gold forecasts last month.  Record Volume  Sales of coins and jewelry surged around the world after\nbullion entered a bear market mid-April, spurring a 13 percent\nrebound in prices in less than three weeks. The rush drove\nvolumes on the Shanghai Gold Exchange,  China \u2019s largest spot\nbullion market, to the highest ever in April, bourse data show.  There are signs interest has slowed. The  U.S. Mint  sold\n57,000 ounces of American Eagle gold coins in June from 70,000\nounces in May and 209,500 ounces in April, according to  data  on\nits website. In  India , the largest user last year, imports may\ndrop 52 percent in the third quarter after government curbs,\naccording to the All India Gems & Jewellery Trade Federation.  Global physical demand has been weaker than in April,\npartly as India imposed curbs on imports, Barclays Plc said on\nJuly 1. So-called price-sensitive buyers may wait for a well-defined bottom before entering the market,  James Steel , an\nanalyst at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., wrote in a June 24 report.  Goldman\u2019s Outlook  Goldman Sachs cut its price target for the end of 2013 to\n$1,300 from $1,435 and expects  holdings  in exchange-traded\nproducts to decline by about 1 million ounces (31.1 metric tons)\na month, according to a June 23 report. Investors are assuming\nan earlier tapering of quantitative easing and a Fed fund rate\nincrease sooner than the bank\u2019s economists expect, it said.  Assets in the SPDR Gold Trust, the largest bullion-backed\nETP, were unchanged yesterday after decreasing to 964.69 tons on\nJuly 2, the least since 2009. Investors have sold 595 tons from\nETPs this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  There\u2019s a risk that ETP holdings may contract by a further\n500 tons, Dominic Schnider, head of commodities research at UBS\nwealth-management unit in Singapore, said on Bloomberg\nTelevision\u2019s \u201cFirst Up\u201d with  Rishaad Salamat  today.  Outflows from ETPs combined with so-called positioning cuts\nin futures & options will probably increase the availability of\ngold by 500 tons to 800 tons in the next six to 12 months,\nSchnider and Giovanni Staunovo wrote in a June 20 report.
