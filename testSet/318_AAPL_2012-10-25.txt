 "context": "The following article called 'K-V Pharmaceutical, Apple, Huawei: Intellectual Property' was published on 2012-10-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nK-V Pharmaceutical Co. (KVPHQ) , the\ndrugmaker that blamed lax federal enforcement for its bankruptcy\nthis year,  filed  a U.S. trade complaint accusing more than 40\ncompounding pharmacies of infringing its property rights.  New England Compounding Pharmacy Inc., the company linked\nto the fungal meningitis outbreak, was among those named in the\ncomplaint yesterday at the U.S. International Trade Commission\nin Washington. K-V claimed the companies are violating\nexclusivity rules for the active ingredient in Makena, a drug\nused to prevent premature births. The Bridgeton, Missouri-based\ncompany is seeking to block imports of the medicine.  K-V has made previous attempts to protect its market share\nfrom compounders, which are lightly regulated pharmacies that\ncan make versions of brand-name drugs as long as they stick to\nindividual prescriptions unavailable through regular avenues. A\nfederal judge dismissed a lawsuit from K-V in September against\nthe  Food and Drug Administration  after the agency refused to\nblock compounding pharmacies that made versions of Makena.  The FDA caused \u201cirreparable harm,\u201d K-V said in its\nfiling, by letting pharmacies sell cheaper versions of the drug,\nwhich has the active ingredient hydroxyprogesterone caproate.  Tony Herrling, a spokesman for K-V at Brainerd\nCommunicators in New York, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a phone\ncall seeking comment.  The practices and oversight of compounding pharmacies have\nbeen thrust into the spotlight this year as a deadly fungal\nmeningitis outbreak is being linked to tainted steroid shots\ntraced back to New England Compounding Pharmacy, or NECC. The\nFramingham, Massachusetts-based company, which suspended\noperations, has been accused by state investigators of operating\non a larger scale than would normally be allowed.  K-V, whose case isn\u2019t directly linked to the meningitis\ninfections, cited the outbreak in its complaint as an example of\ninstances where compounding copies of FDA-approved drugs could\nharm public health.  The company had attempted to get the FDA to stop\ncompounding pharmacies from selling versions of Makena by\nproducing testing data of its own that called into question the\npurity and potency of compounded products. The FDA conducted its\nown testing and said in June that three of 26 samples failed the\nstandard for potency and no major safety issues were identified.  The FDA said it has discretion to enforce laws against\npharmacies to keep them from making versions of approved drugs.  The ITC is a quasi-judicial agency in Washington that\ninvestigates allegations of unfair trade practices. While the\nagency can\u2019t award monetary damages like a regular court, it\ndoes have the power to block imports of products that infringe\nU.S. patents or other intellectual property rights.  Apple Loses Dutch Patent Case Against Samsung on Touch Screen  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  lost a Dutch court ruling in a patent lawsuit\nover Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s Galaxy handsets.  Samsung\u2019s Galaxy products using certain versions of  Google\nInc. (GOOG) \u2019s Android operating system don\u2019t infringe Apple patents\nconcerning so-called multitouch flags, Judge Peter Blok said in\na ruling yesterday in The Hague, Netherlands. Apple claims\nGalaxy smartphones and tablets infringe a patent for technology\nthat interprets finger activity on touch screens.  The ruling is the latest in a long line of disputes in\ncourts across the globe as rivals including  HTC Corp. (2498) , Apple and\nSamsung fight for dominance in the smart phone and tablet-\ncomputer markets. The Hague-based court said yesterday\u2019s verdict\nfollows similar rulings in the U.K. and Germany on the touch-\nscreen patents.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, was also ordered to\npay Samsung about 325,000 euros ($420,000) in costs, the judge\nsaid.  Steve Park , a spokesman for Apple in  Seoul , declined to\ncomment.  The court started a new round of trials between Apple and\nSamsung in the Netherlands in September, concerning multiple\npatents and proceedings as Apple seeks a ban on Galaxy devices\nin the country, where the Suwon, South Korea-based company has\nits distribution center for Europe. The companies compete in a\nglobal smart phone market that grew 62 percent to $219 billion\nlast year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  Samsung Infringes Four Apple Patents, U.S. Trade Judge Says  Samsung Electronics Co. infringes four Apple Inc. patents,\nincluding one for the design of the iPhone and one for touch-\nscreen technology co-invented by  Steve Jobs , a U.S. trade judge\nsaid in a decision that gives Apple another legal victory over\nits biggest smartphone competitor.  Two other patents, including one for the exterior shape of\nthe iPhone, weren\u2019t infringed, U.S. International Trade\nCommission Judge Thomas Pender said in a notice on the agency\u2019s\nwebsite. The judge\u2019s findings are subject to review by the full\ncommission, which has the power to stop goods that infringe U.S.\npatents at the border.  The agency has twice before forced companies to alter\nforeign-made smartphones if they wanted to keep selling them in\nthe U.S. HTC Corp. phones were held up at the border in May\nafter Apple won a trade case, and the Cupertino, California-\nbased company has an enforcement action pending that accuses HTC\nof violating the trade agency\u2019s exclusion order. Google Inc.\u2019s\nMotorola Mobility unit was ordered to remove a feature to\ncoordinate schedules from its phones after they were found to\ninfringe a Microsoft Corp. patent.  The case in yesterday\u2019s ruling is one of more than three\ndozen between the makers of about half of the world\u2019s\nsmartphones, who have run up hundreds of millions of dollars in\nlegal bills. Samsung, which lost a $1 billion jury verdict in\nAugust against Apple, is challenging a different ITC judge\u2019s\nfindings that its own patents weren\u2019t infringed by Apple.  The ITC, as an independent agency under the executive\nbranch, isn\u2019t bound by the legal standard used in that decision.\nIts job is to protect U.S. markets from unfair trade practices,\nincluding patent infringement, and its only power lies in the\nability to keep products from entering the U.S.  Samsung has submitted documents to Pender about a way to\nchange its designs to address the patent dispute, though the\npapers are confidential so it isn\u2019t known what changes to its\nphones are involved. Apple is seeking to block U.S. imports of\nmore than a dozen models of Samsung phones and tablets,\nincluding Galaxy Tab, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy SII, and Galaxy Note.  The Apple case against Samsung is In the Matter of\nElectronic Digital Media Devices, 337-796, and Samsung\u2019s case is\nIn the Matter of Electronic Devices, Including Wireless\nCommunication Devices, Portable Music and Data Processing\nDevices, and Tablet Computers, 337-794, both U.S. International\nTrade Commission (Washington).

Trademark  UConn Sends Cease-and-Desist Letter Over Husky-Dog Logo Use  The  University of Connecticut  sent a cease and desist\nletter to a public school saying its Husky-dog logo too closely\nresembles the university\u2019s, the San Francisco Chronicle\n reported.   Although the Morgan School of Clinton, Connecticut, has\nused a Husky-dog mascot for almost 80 years, the university has\nasked that it be redesigned, according to the Chronicle.  Michael Enright, a spokesman for the university\u2019s athletic\nprogram, said no trademark-infringement case will be filed and\nthe school will have some time to remove the objectionable logo\nfrom its uniforms and other uses, the newspaper reported.  After Jack Cross, superintendent of Clinton schools, said\nit could cost as much as $20,000 to remove the logo from a new\nartificial turf field, Enright responded that it doesn\u2019t need to\nbe changed until next time the turf is replaced, according to\nthe Chronicle.

(AMSC) , a U.S. maker of wind-turbine\ncomponents, said in a statement yesterday that its copyright\ncase against  Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558)  will be heard Oct. 26 by\nChina\u2019s Supreme People\u2019s Court.  The case before China\u2019s high court is Sinovel\u2019s appeal of a\nlower court\u2019s refusal to dismiss the case. Sinovel, which was\nformerly AMSC\u2019s largest customer, is the target of four separate\ncases brought by the wind-turbine company. A total of more than\n$1.2 billion in damages is being sought.  In the copyright case, Denvens, Massachusetts-based AMSC is\nseeking both $6 million in damages and a court order barring\nfurther infringement of its  intellectual property .  Underlying this case is the action of Dejan Karabasevic, a\nformer AMSC employee who pleaded guilty in 2011 to trade secret\nmisappropriation. Karabasevic, a Serbian software engineer,\nacknowledged that he used source code from an AMSC server to\ndevelop a program to run Sinovel\u2019s turbines.  In June 2011, AMSC technicians discovered the purloined\nsoftware in a Sinovel wind turbine in the Gobi desert.  AMSC, which was founded by four professors from the\n Massachusetts Institute of Technology , is \u201ceager to complete\nour hearing on Oct. 26,\u201d and is hopeful that the Chinese high\ncourt will \u201cdemonstrate that it is protecting the interests of\nall companies -- both domestic and foreign,\u201d John Powell, AMSC\nvice president and general counsel, said in his company\u2019s\nstatement.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage  Huawei Says U.S. Concerns \u2018Distorted\u2019 as  Australia  Plans Blocked  Huawei Technologies Co., China\u2019s largest maker of telephone\nequipment, said concerns about security threats from the company\nare \u201cdistorted\u201d and offered Australian authorities access to\nits code and equipment.  The company is willing to offer \u201ccomplete and unrestricted\naccess\u201d as part of its proposal to create a cyber-evaluation\ncenter, according to John Lord, chairman of Huawei\u2019s Australian\nunit. All materials used in major Australian networks can be\ntested at the center, he said.  \u201cReading many media reports, you would get the impression\nthat Huawei is in some sort of war with Australian security\nagencies -- we are not,\u201d Lord said, according to the e-mailed\ntext of a speech at the  National Press Club  in Canberra. \u201cWe\nsincerely hope that in Australia, we do not allow sober debate\non  cyber security  to become distorted the way it has in the\nU.S.\u201d  U.S. lawmakers last month urged domestic companies to steer\nclear of Huawei and fellow Chinese company  ZTE Corp. (000063) , citing\nconcerns that the Chinese government could install malicious\nhardware or software in U.S. telecommunications networks. In\nMarch, the Australian government said Huawei was banned from\nbidding on a national broadband network because of \u201cnational\ninterests.\u201d  The U.S. report is a \u201cmissed opportunity to develop\nmethods of countering\u201d common security threats, Lord said\nyesterday. \u201cThis is why we are proposing a cyber-security\nevaluation center, where all equipment implemented into major or\ncritical Australian networks can be subjected to the same\nthorough security assessment.\u201d  Chinese companies like Huawei have been labeled as more\nwilling to steal intellectual property than produce it, Lord\nsaid. In reality, Huawei was listed in the top five companies\nfor new patent applications by the  World Intellectual Property\nOrganization  and is out-pacing global rivals including Apple\nInc.,  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Microsoft Corp. and General\nElectric Co., he said.  In Australia, the company is continuing to expand its\nbusiness outside of the national broadband network, he said. It\nhas increased staff to more than 900 from 200 three years ago,\nLord said.  \u201cHuawei is here in Australia for the long-haul,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAustralia must reap the benefits offered by the globalized\ninformation and communication technology industry and the\ninnovation pouring out of Asia and China. As we enter the Asian\nCentury, anything less would risk Australia being left behind.\u201d  Ex-BSkyB Employee Leaked Company Data, U.K. High Court Rules  Customer data belonging to  British Sky Broadcasting Group\nPlc (BSY)  was leaked to a television repair business, the U.K.\u2019s High\nCourt of Justice ruled.  Judge Sir William Blackwell said that he was\n\u201cunpersuaded\u201d by arguments that the data was transmitted\ninnocently to the repair business, which then went to solicit\nBSkyB customers in advance of the expiration of their\nwarranties.  He said that the pay television provider was due damages,\nand that the case should also be referred to government\nauthorities for possible criminal proceedings against those who\nleaked the data and gave misleading statements to the court\nabout their actions.
