 "context": "The following article called 'Ericsson, Nokia Siemens Oppose China Tariffs' was published on 2013-05-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEricsson AB (ERICB)  and Nokia Siemens\nNetworks urged the European Union to back off from its threat of\nimposing tariffs on Chinese-made mobile-telecommunications\nequipment, throwing support behind some of their biggest rivals\nin the region.  The European Commission said yesterday it was prepared to\nprobe possible Chinese subsidies to network makers such as\nHuawei Technologies Co. and  ZTE Corp. (000063)  and the possible sale of\nequipment in the EU below cost. The inquiries would cover EU\nimports of more than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) a year and\ndetermine whether these shipments unfairly harmed European\nmanufacturers.  \u201cEricsson does not support this move by the Commission,\u201d\nsaid Ulf Pehrsson, head of government and industry relations at\nthe Stockholm-based company, the world\u2019s largest maker of\nwireless networks. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in this type of unilateral\nmeasure. Our policy is for open, free and unrestricted trade and\nglobal supply chains.\u201d  The threat of European tariffs against China\u2019s\nmanufacturers highlights the EU\u2019s growing concern about Chinese\ndominance of markets in Europe and its readiness to make imports\nmore expensive in a bid to aid domestic competitors. The EU is\nthe biggest export market for China, which is the bloc\u2019s second-largest trading partner, after the U.S.  Balancing Act  Yet, that push isn\u2019t garnering overt support from Europe\u2019s\nbiggest equipment makers because they are as concerned about\ngenerating sales from the booming Chinese market as much as\nfending off price competition in their home countries, where\nphone carriers from  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  to Royal KPN NV are\nstruggling to cut debt and to finance network expansion.  \u201cThis is the first time the EU has initiated this type of\nan investigation without a complaint from the vendors,\u201d Dai\nShu, a Shenzhen-based spokesman for ZTE, said in a phone\ninterview today. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird. There are no specific\nvendors who initiated these allegations.\u201d  As ZTE hasn\u2019t received a formal notice from the EU, the\ncompany isn\u2019t able to do a detailed analysis of the business\nimpact of any tariffs, he said. ZTE\u2019s share of Europe\u2019s\ninfrastructure market is \u201cvery small\u201d and the company denies\nit receives subsidies or engages in dumping, he said.  China Sales  China  accounted for 5.9 percent of Ericsson\u2019s  sales  last\nyear and Alcatel-Lucent SA  made  7.6 percent, data compiled by\nBloomberg showed. Nokia Siemens made 9.6 percent from the\ngreater China region, the company said in its  annual report . The\nterm greater China typically refers to the region that comprises\nmainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and  Taiwan .  China is evaluating bids for the rollout of high-speed\nfourth-generation mobile networks, and western gearmakers are\nhoping to get a share of the contracts.  \u201cChina is a major market for all the infrastructure\nvendors, so there will be great interest in minimizing potential\nimpact on their opportunities in China,\u201d said Susan Welsh de Grimaldo, director of mobile broadband at Strategy Analytics in\nNewton,  Massachusetts .  Huawei, seeking to accelerate growth in Europe, said last\nmonth it plans to hire 5,500 people in the region over the next\nfive years, predicting the need for faster services and cheaper\nsmartphones will drive demand in Europe. Nokia Siemens, Ericsson\nand Alcatel-Lucent have announced more than 24,000 job cuts in\ntotal since 2011.  Nokia Siemens  \u201cWe absolutely oppose any efforts to restrict free trade\nand erect trade barriers of any kind and have urged the\nCommission to refrain from taking such steps,\u201d said Barry French, a spokesman at Nokia Siemens, the venture between  Nokia\nOyj (NOK1V)  and  Siemens AG. (SIE)  \u201cWe have made that position clear to the\nCommission both verbally and in writing.\u201d  Simon Poulter, a spokesman for Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent,\ndeclined to comment on the EU initiative.  Ericsson  shares  slipped 1.1 percent to 82.10 kronor at 9:32\na.m. in Stockholm, paring their gain this year to 26 percent.\nNokia rose 1 percent in Helsinki, Siemens fell 0.6 percent in\n Frankfurt , and Alcatel-Lucent increased 0.8 percent on the Paris\nexchange.  U.S. industry has expressed similar concerns about a\nbacklash from China. In an April 4  letter  to Congress, groups\nincluding the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the\nTelecommunications Industry Association wrote they feared a rule\nthat would make it more difficult for government departments to\nacquire technologies from China might cause retaliation against\nU.S. vendors \u201cby enacting a similar policy for screening IT\nsystem purchases in China.\u201d  Fair Play  \u201cIf the Europeans were to act against the Chinese vendors,\nthey can expect retaliation against European companies in\nChina,\u201d said Simon Leopold, an analyst at Raymond James &\nAssociates in New York.  In an e-mailed statement, Shenzhen-based Huawei said the\ncompany is disappointed with the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy\ninvestigations against Chinese vendors. In Europe and in all\nmarkets, Huawei \u201calways plays fair\u201d and wins business and\ntrust from customers \u201cthrough innovative technology and quality\nservice,\u201d rather than via pricing or subsidies, it said.
