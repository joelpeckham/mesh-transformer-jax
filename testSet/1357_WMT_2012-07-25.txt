The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIndian stocks fell to a one-month\nlow amid concern slowing economic growth will hurt corporate\nearnings already threatened by  Europe \u2019s worsening debt crisis.  Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. (JSP)  slipped to its lowest price in\nthree years after profit slumped.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the\nbiggest engineering company, retreated for a fourth day. The BSE\n India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  dropped 0.4 percent to 16,846.05, the\nlowest close since June 18.  India\u2019s economic expansion slowed to a near-decade low in\nthe March quarter from a year ago as the debt crisis in Europe,\nits top trading partner, curbed exports and a policy gridlock\ndeterred investments. Six of 12, or 50 percent, of companies on\nthe Sensex that have posted June-quarter earnings have trailed\nestimates, compared with 30 percent in the March quarter and 47\npercent three months earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nGrowth will decelerate this year in India and the other BRIC\nnations, the  International Monetary Fund  said July 16.  \u201cFor 2013 we\u2019re looking at 9 percent earnings growth in\nthe Sensex companies and about 11 percent for 2014,\u201d compared\nwith an average 33 percent annually between 2004 and 2008, said\nSanjeev Prasad, senior executive director and co-head of Kotak\nInstitutional Equities, in an interview to Bloomberg UTV today.\n\u201cYou have seen a big downshift in the earnings numbers and that\ncomes from the fact that your GDP growth itself is slowing\ndramatically. We have 6 percent growth in GDP for the current\nyear and I don\u2019t think it is going to be higher in 2014.\u201d  Worst Performer  Jindal Steel sank 4.6 percent to 395.8 rupees, the lowest\nclose since July 2009, after first-quarter profit unexpectedly\ndeclined because of an impairment charge on an investment in\n Bolivia .  Net income  sank 58 percent to 3.9 billion rupees. The\nstock is the  worst performer  today on the Sensex.  Sesa Goa Ltd. (SESA) , India\u2019s biggest iron-ore exporter, dropped\n1.6 percent to 183 rupees after reporting first-quarter net\nincome that missed estimates late yesterday. Group  net income \nincreased 15 percent to 9.64 billion rupees ($172 million). The\nmedian profit estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was\n9.8 billion rupees.  Spanish two-year bond yields surged to a euro-era record,\nprompting policy makers to deny an international bailout was\nbeing prepared. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  and\nSpanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said that  Spain \u2019s\nborrowing costs don\u2019t reflect the strength of its economy as\nthey pledged to work toward deeper integration to fight the debt\ncrisis. The European Union accounted for 17.2 percent of India\u2019s\nexports in the six months during April to September 2011, data\nfrom the commerce ministry show.  Fund Flows  The Sensex has still gained 9 percent this year, bolstered\nby foreign  funds  who have invested a net $10.2 billion in local\nequities since Jan. 1, the highest in  Asia  and a record for the\nperiod. The flows have increased on speculation the government\nwill revive its economic reforms agenda to bolster an economy\ngrowing at the weakest pace in almost a decade.  The Sensex trades at 13.2 times estimated earnings, lower\nthan its three-year average multiple of 16.6.  China \u2019s Shanghai\nComposite Index has fallen 13 percent from this year\u2019s high on\nMarch 2 to trade near its lowest level since March 2009 amid\nconcern the economic slowdown is deepening. The Chinese gauge\ntrades at 9.5 times estimated profit, compared with the average\nof 17.5 since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2006.  \u201cIndia is not a very cheap market despite all the talk of\ngloom and doom,\u201d Kotak\u2019s Prasad said. \u201cChina, which is facing\nchallenges as far as economic slowdown is concerned, is trading\nat below 9 times, which is a lot more attractive than the 13.5\ntimes where India is trading currently. If we don\u2019t implement\nsome of the important reforms which people are expecting, the\nmarket will go down.\u201d  Opposition  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh , who took control of the\n finance ministry  in June, has pledged to revive an economic\nreforms agenda stymied by opposition from its own allies. The\ngovernment last year suspended a plan to allow  Wal-Mart Stores\nInc. (WMT)  and other foreign companies to open supermarkets, while an\nanti-corruption bill and proposals to allow foreign investment\nin aviation and pensions are also stalled.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against\nlosses in the  S&P CNX Nifty (NIFTY)  Index, fell 1.3 percent to 16.75.\nThe Nifty index lost 0.4 percent to 5,109.60.
