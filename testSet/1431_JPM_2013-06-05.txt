 "context": "The following article called 'SEC Money Fund Rule Changing $1 Share Faces Less Opposition' was published on 2013-06-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSome of the largest U.S. providers of\nmoney-market mutual funds have sought a compromise on new\nregulation, making adoption of tougher rules for the $2.6\ntrillion industry more likely if far from a sure bet.  A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposal,\nscheduled to be voted on today, would require the riskiest\nfunds to end the longstanding practice of pricing shares at a\nfixed value of $1 and instead force them to float. The vote will\nkick off a months-long burst of lobbying from investors, fund\ncompanies and other stakeholders before SEC commissioners\nconsider a final version.  \u201cThis is going to be a long, drawn-out rulemaking\ninitiative,\u201d said Barry P. Barbash, a former director of\n investment management  at the SEC. \u201cThe SEC staff and commission\nrecognize you have to start somewhere.\u201d  The proposal is the SEC\u2019s second phase of response to\nvulnerabilities exposed by the 2008 financial crisis, when the\n$62.5 billion Reserve Primary Fund collapsed and money funds\ntemporarily required a U.S. government guarantee.  U.S. regulators have long warned that money funds, which\nare commonly considered a safe, stable place to keep cash,\naren\u2019t insured deposits and could pose systemic risk to the\nfinancial system. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, an\numbrella group of U.S. regulators including the Federal Reserve,\nsaid last year that money funds remain vulnerable to runs\nbecause shareholders are likely to flee if a fund\u2019s share price\ndrops below $1.  \u2018Fire Sales\u2019  \u201cWholesale funding markets remain vulnerable to runs that\ncould, in turn, trigger destabilizing fire sales,\u201dTobias Adrian , vice president of the  Federal Reserve  Bank of  New York ,\nwarned the council members in a public meeting in April. \u201cTo\naddress such concerns, the council recommends that the SEC\nconsider regulatory action to improve the loss absorption\ncapacity of money-market funds and mitigate run risk associated\nwith those funds.\u201d  Jeffrey N. Gordon, a professor at  Columbia Law School  and\ndirector of its Richman Center for Business, Law and Public\nPolicy, expressed concern that the SEC proposal wouldn\u2019t go far\nenough. He said the SEC should require funds to hold capital\nbecause the failure of single large issuer of debt could cause\nshares to fall below $1 and spark a run.  \u201cI think it\u2019s a missed opportunity,\u201d Gordon said in a\nphone interview. \u201cWith the SEC, we are risking political actors\ntrying to protect an industry.\u201d  Long Deadlock  The SEC\u2019s proposal, whose details have not been released,\nhas divided the money-fund industry and faces additional\nresistance from investors concerned about potential tax\nliabilities. New money-fund regulation has also split the five-member commission, which deadlocked over the issue last year\nbefore the effort was revived. Several commission members have\nindicated support for the new proposal, which could be revised\nbefore a final vote.  The SEC\u2019s proposal would impose the floating-share value\nonly on \u201cprime\u201d funds that buy corporate debt and cater to\ninstitutional clients, according to two people familiar with the\nplan, who asked not to be identified because the proposal wasn\u2019t\npublic. Corporations that use the funds like cash accounts say\nthe new regulations risk harming a convenient, highly liquid\ncash-management product.  \u2018Breaking the Buck\u2019  A floating share value is intended to make funds more\nstable by signaling to investors that the value of the shares\ncan fall below $1 -- known as \u201cbreaking the buck\u201d -- without\nthe fund collapsing.  \u201cBreaking the buck should no longer be a significant event\nbecause  money market funds  would simply fluctuate in value in\nthe same manner as other mutual funds,\u201d FSOC wrote last year\nwhen it issued recommendations for further regulation of money\nfunds.  The  Investment Company Institute , the fund industry\u2019s trade\ngroup, has argued a floating share value won\u2019t stop a run on\nmoney funds. Even so, the ICI has adopted a wait-and-see\napproach, saying last week that it \u201cexpects this proposal will\nreflect the extensive research and discussion among\ncommissioners and staff since last summer.\u201d  The ICI has insisted funds should retain their fixed share\nvalue. Instead, the institute has proposed that fund boards be\nallowed to suspend withdrawals when weekly liquid assets fall to\nbetween 7.5 percent and 15 percent of total fund assets, or half\nthe required level. After putting down such \u201cliquidity gates,\u201d\nfunds would be able to charge a fee equal to 1 percent of\nredemption proceeds to investors who wanted to cash out shares,\nunder the ICI proposal.  Fewer Funds  The SEC\u2019s current floating-share proposal would affect\nfewer funds than a concept former Chairman  Mary Schapiro \nchampioned in late 2011 and 2012, which envisioned changing the\naccounting standard for all money funds, including those that\ninvest only in  government securities  or municipal bonds. The new\nproposal doesn\u2019t include recommendations made by FSOC last year\nand opposed by money funds, including requiring them to hold\ncapital against potential losses.  The U.S.  Chamber of Commerce , which opposed the 2011 and\n2012 proposals, expects \u201cliquidity gates\u201d to be part of the\ncurrent proposal, said Alice Joe, the executive director of the\nChamber\u2019s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness.  \u2018Careful Thought\u2019  \u201cThis time around, there seems to be more careful thought\ninto putting out a proposal and more of an openness of the staff\nand commissioners to listening to the views of the\nstakeholders,\u201d Joe said in an interview.  SEC Chairman Mary Jo White said last month that the goal of\nnew regulation is to mitigate the systemic risk posed by some\nmoney funds while preserving the product\u2019s value to investors.  The Chamber, which has sued the SEC over other regulations,\nlauded a recent commission analysis for rigorously studying the\nissue. The report found that SEC reforms passed in 2010 wouldn\u2019t\nhave prevented the Reserve Primary Fund from breaking the buck\nand being liquidated. Those rule changes included new minimum\nliquidity levels, shorter average maturity limits, tougher\ncredit quality standards and new disclosure requirements.  The SEC has held talks with the  Internal Revenue Service \nover the tax implications of a floating-share value for money\nfunds, since investors could owe taxes if they recorded a\ncapital gain when selling shares. The proposal considered\ntomorrow isn\u2019t expected to indicate the IRS\u2019s decision on\nwhether to waive the tax rules.  Congressional Action  \u201cI am not quite sure they can just wave their magic wand\nand at a the drop of a pin, give relief to it,\u201d Joe said. \u201cIt\nmay require congressional action to solve that problem.\u201d  The $2.6 trillion money fund industry includes 580 funds,\naccording to the  Investment Company Institute . The top 10 fund\nfamilies, including those run by  Fidelity Investments ,  JPMorgan\nChase & Co. (JPM) , and Federated Investors Inc., control 75 percent of\nassets, according to Crane Data LLC, a research firm in\nWestborough,  Massachusetts .  The largest U.S. money-fund providers shifted their\nlobbying this year away from all-out opposition to limiting the\nscope of potential new rules.  A proposal limiting rule changes to prime institutional\nfunds would be a victory for companies including Fidelity,\nVanguard and  Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)  All three called for exempting\nfunds that invest only in government debt or municipal bonds, as\nwell as all funds that serve only retail investors. They pointed\nto data showing that withdrawals in the weeks following Reserve\nPrimary\u2019s demise were concentrated in prime institutional funds.  BlackRock Ideas  The proposal also appears to favor ideas championed by\nasset manager  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , which called for allowing funds to\nmaintain their $1 share value while imposing a 1 percent fee on\nwithdrawals when a fund\u2019s weekly liquidity dropped below half\nthe required level.  Federated Investors Inc. (FII) , the third-largest manager of U.S.\nmoney-market funds, said last year it would sue to block changes\ncontemplated by the SEC. Federated has said a floating net-asset\nvalue would destroy the value of money funds and lead to a\nsubstantially smaller industry.  Meghan McAndrew, a Federated spokeswoman, said the\nPittsburgh-based fund company believes the SEC\u2019s 2010 reforms\nwere sufficient to improve the transparency and strength of\nmoney funds.  \u201cYou have a lack of consensus about whether there is an\nissue that needs to be resolved and how it needs to be\nresolved,\u201d said Barbash, co-chairman of the asset management\npractice at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP. \u201cThat is what makes\nthis an extraordinarily difficult environment in which to do a\nrule.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDave Michaels in Washington at \n dmichaels5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Maura Reynolds  at \n mreynolds34@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 42.549156188964844 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
