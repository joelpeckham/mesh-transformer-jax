 "context": "The following article called 'Stada Says Strength of Russian Unit May Attract Bids' was published on 2013-01-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ) , the German\ngeneric-drug maker that spent more than 250 million euros ($331\nmillion) on acquisitions last year, said it expects to draw\ntakeover offers from rivals seeking to expand in Europe.  \u201cIn Europe, we have a sweet spot in  Russia \u201d and \u201cwe are\ndoing a very good job\u201d in businesses including consumer health\ncare, Markus Metzger, the Bad Vilbel, Germany-based company\u2019s\ndirector of investor relations, said yesterday at the JPMorgan\nChase & Co. health-care conference in San Francisco. Companies\nthat don\u2019t have those businesses in Europe \u201cmay look at buying\nus,\u201d he said.  Stada may be a target of  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries\nLtd. (SUNP) ,  India \u2019s largest drugmaker by market value, which was\nconsidering acquisitions in  Europe , including the German\ndrugmaker, people familiar with the matter said in August. Sun,\nmaker of generic Flomax and Plavix, seeks to add products and\nextend its geographical reach, Chairman Israel Makov said in a\nDec. 31 interview.  Metzger declined to comment specifically on Sun\u2019s potential\ninterest or on other possible acquirers.  \u201cIt\u2019s finally a matter of price,\u201d Metzger said during a\nquestion-and-answer session at the conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not in our\nhands, we have a 100 percent free float,\u201d he said.  Company Value  Stada would be worth about 3.7 billion euros, based on the\n10.3 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and\namortization median price of eight generic drugmaker\nacquisitions over the past three years, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The drugmaker probably had EBITDA of 357\nmillion euros in the year ended Dec. 31, based on the average of\n22 analyst estimates gathered by Bloomberg.  Stada rose 0.7 percent to close at 25.79 euros in Frankfurt\ntrading, giving the company a market value of 1.5 billion euros.  Stada\u2019s share price is \u201cdepressed\u201d partly because of the\n European debt crisis  and past writedowns on its Serbian\nbusiness, Metzger said.  \u201cWe are still looking cheap,\u201d Metzger said. \u201cWe had some\nnegatives. Credibility is slowly coming back. We are more\nstabilized in Serbia right now.\u201d  Metzger declined to specify a target price for the company\nand said it was \u201cup to investment bankers\u201d to gauge the value.  \u201cIf anyone pays 50 euros, it\u2019s going to be difficult to\nsay no,\u201d he said, referring to a per-share price.  Serbian Writedown  Stada would also consider merging with a similar-sized\nbranded or biotechnology drugmaker, Chief Executive Officer\nHartmut Retzlaff said in October 2011. The acquisition of the\nsimilar-sized competitors Ratiopharm GmbH and  Actavis Group hf \nhave widened the gap between Stada and generic-drug industry\nleaders.  Stada bought  Serbia \u2019s Hemofarm Koncern AD in 2006 for 480\nmillion euros, its biggest acquisition and part of a push to\nshift manufacturing capacity as well as sales into eastern\nEurope. It took a 96.9 million-euro writedown before taxes in\nthe third quarter of 2011 for unpaid bills there.  The company is proceeding with its expansion and is on\ntrack to meet its 2014 targets, Metzger told investors yesterday\nat the conference. It could spend as much as 150 million euros\nin 2013 for smaller deals to grow in areas such as consumer\nhealth care, he said.  \u201cOur financial flexibility is somewhat limited, but on a\nsmaller scale we are still looking out for good opportunities in\nOTC and maybe for joint ventures in some of the  emerging\nmarkets ,\u201d he said.  Stada would like to expand in countries such as  Mexico ,\n Argentina  and is \u201clooking at opportunities in  China ,  Thailand \nand other Asian countries,\u201d Metzger said.  \u201cIt\u2019s also very tempting to add new products to our\nRussian platform,\u201d he said.
