 "context": "The following article called 'Asian Stocks Decline as Japanese Exporters Drop on Yen' was published on 2013-06-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAsian  stocks  dropped, with the\nregional benchmark index heading for its longest streak of\nweekly losses in a year, as Japanese exporters retreated after\nthe yen\u2019s biggest surge in three years.  Japan \u2019s  Topix index  and Nikkei 225 Stock Average pared\ndeclines as the Government Pension Investment Fund called a\nbriefing about proposed changes to its asset portfolio. Honda\nMotor Co., which gets 83 percent of its sales overseas, slipped\n3.9 percent. Newcrest Mining Ltd. slumped 7.6 percent as\n Australia \u2019s biggest gold producer said it will write down the\nvalue of its mines by as much as A$6 billion ($5.7 billion).  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed at 131.36 as\nof 8:21 p.m. in  Tokyo  as gains by the yen increased the value of\nJapanese companies in the dollar-denominated measure after the\ncountry\u2019s markets closed. Almost two shares retreated for each\nthat gained. The gauge is headed for a 2.5 percent decline this\nweek, its third straight, the longest such run of losses in a\nyear. Japanese shares have slumped this week after Prime\nMinister Shinzo Abe failed to impress investors in a speech\noutlining his growth strategy.  \u201cAbe\u2019s growth strategy has already been priced in, getting\nrid of buying opportunities,\u201d said Isao Kubo, a Tokyo-based\nequity strategist at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which\noversees about 6 trillion yen ($62 billion.) \u201cJapanese shares\nand the yen have corrected a lot to the point where some\ninvestors may as well buy the stocks. But we are not seeing\nbuying because the global market is volatile ahead of a U.S.\njobs report.\u201d  Further Losses  Japan\u2019s  Topix index  closed 1.3 percent lower, paring an\nearlier decline of 3.5 percent and taking its losses since a\nhigh on May 22 to about 17 percent. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average\nlost just 0.2 percent, rebounding from a 2.8 percent drop. Even\nafter recent declines, Japan\u2019s is the best-performing share\nmarket in the developed world this year.  GPIF, which managed 112 trillion yen at Dec. 31, said after\nJapan\u2019s equity markets closed that it will reduce its  holdings \nof local bonds and buy more equities. The proportion of Japanese\nshares will increase to 12 percent from 11 percent and foreign\nstocks will be boosted to 12 percent from 9 percent, the Health,\nLabour and Welfare Ministry said.  \u201cWhat they\u2019ve reduced in Japanese  government bonds ,they\u2019re\nbasically taking abroad,\u201d said  Masaru Hamasaki , a strategist at\nTokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees\nthe equivalent of $100 billion. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to get\naway from a bias toward Japan, and just because stocks are\nrising now doesn\u2019t mean they will so easily change their view.\nThey are probably looking at how far stocks have come and their\noutlook for growth, and I can\u2019t imagine that they\u2019re that\nbullish.\u201d  Regional Indexes  Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.9 percent and New\nZealand\u2019s NZX 50 Index slid 0.4 percent.  South Korea \u2019s Kospi\nindex dropped 1.8 percent, reopening following a public holiday.\n Hong Kong \u2019s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  lost 1.2 percent and  China \u2019s\nShanghai Composite Index fell 1.3 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500 Index  were little changed today\nafter the gauge gained 0.9 percent in  New York  yesterday. A\nLabor Department report today is expected to indicate employers\nadded 163,000 to non-farm payrolls last month, almost equal to\nthe gain in April. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in May suggested\nthe central bank could curtail its bond buying if the job market\nimproves in a \u201creal and sustainable way.\u201d  Fed Stimulus  The MSCI Asia Pacific gauge has fallen more than 9 percent\nfrom this year\u2019s high on May 20 on speculation that improvement\nin the  U.S. economy  will lead the  Federal Reserve  to scale back\nrecord stimulus.  The measure yesterday traded at 12.8 times average\nestimated earnings, compared with 14.8 for the Standard & Poor\u2019s\n500 Index and 12.9 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japanese exporters dropped as the yen headed for its\nbiggest weekly advance since October 2008. A stronger yen\nreduces the value of overseas sales when repatriated.  Honda slipped 3.9 percent to 3,495 yen. Toyota Motor Corp.,\nthe world\u2019s biggest carmaker, fell 2.8 percent to 5,480 yen.\n Panasonic Corp. (6752) , Japan\u2019s second largest television maker, sank\n3.6 percent to 721 yen.  Newcrest Mining slumped 7.6 percent to A$12.35 after\nannouncing the writedown due to a slump in  gold prices . The cut\nin value of mines will have a \u201cmaterial impact on the 2013\nfinancial year statutory accounts,\u201d the Melbourne-based company\nsaid today in a statement.  Samsung Electronics Co., the world\u2019s largest smartphone\nmaker, tumbled 6.2 percent to 1.427 million won in  Seoul , the\nmost since August 2012, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co.\ncut profit estimates, citing slowing demand for its flagship\nGalaxy S4.  China Rates  Financial stocks led declines in Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng\nComposite Index as China\u2019s money-market rates jumped. People\u2019s\nInsurance Company Group of China Ltd., owner of the nation\u2019s\nbiggest casualty insurer, sank 5.7 percent to HK$3.61.\nIndustrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world\u2019s top\nlender by market value, fell 1.1 percent to HK$5.24.  Among stocks that gained,  Texhong Textile Group Ltd. (2678)  surged\n8.4 percent to a record closing high of HK$12.16 after the\nfabric maker said earnings may jump.
