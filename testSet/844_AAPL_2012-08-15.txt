The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHTC Corp. (2498) , facing a record drop in sales, needs to \u201ckill bureaucracy\u201d and improve communication after changing market conditions allowed competitors to gain share, Chief Executive Officer Peter Chou told employees.  \u201cWe have people in meeting and talking all the time but without decision, strategic direction or sense of urgency,\u201d Chou wrote to HTC\u2019s  workers , Chairwoman  Cher Wang  and the board of directors in an e-mail obtained by  Bloomberg News . \u201cBureaucracy crept in without clear ownership. We agreed to do something but we either didn\u2019t do it or executed it loosely.\u201d  Sally Julien, a spokeswoman for HTC, confirmed the e-mail.  HTC, the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based maker of Desire, Sensation and One smartphones,  forecast  revenue this quarter as much as 20 percent less than analysts\u2019 estimates as competition from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung Electronics Co. halved its global share. Declining sales and profitability have prompted HTC to close offices and cut jobs to reduce costs.  \u201cWe are disappointed that our sales are down while smartphone market share is growing,\u201d Chou wrote in the Aug. 9 e-mail titled \u201cwe are coming back.\u201d  Fast Growth  \u201cOur competitors can leverage their scale, brand awareness and big marketing budget to do things which HTC could not do,\u201d Chou wrote. \u201cThe fast growth from the last two years has slowed us down.\u201d  Revenue  surged 67 percent  last year after jumping 93 percent in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That figure dropped 31 percent in the first half of this year.  HTC shares lost 4.1 percent to close at NT$243.50 in Taipei today, taking its decline this year to 51 percent after dropping 42 percent last year. Revenue this quarter will be NT$70 billion ($2.3 billion) to NT$80 billion, it said Aug. 3, missing the NT$87 billion average of 10 analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg in the 28 days prior to the announcement.  Chou, 55, said the company needs to build on its culture, \u201ccommitted\u201d employees and customer relationships.  \u201cDon\u2019t let the processes, rules and norms to impact our important goals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOf course we have to follow certain rules and criteria but don\u2019t let small things kill the major goals.\u201d  \u201cThe industry\u2019s best rating\u201d for HTC\u2019s One X handset is evidence the company has the best products, Chou wrote. There are also strong products in the pipeline for this year and early next year, Chou wrote without naming them.  Market Noises  HTC\u2019s share of the global smartphone market dropped to 4.5 percent in the first quarter from a peak of 10.7 percent in the second quarter of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. Its sales have missed analyst estimates for the last four quarters, Bloomberg  data  show.  Chou said workers have every reason to remain confident and should not be \u201cinfluenced by noises from market and industry\u201d because the company is \u201cjust having short-term challenges.\u201d  \u201cPlease make sure that we kill bureaucracy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cStay firm with the hero innovations and make them even bigger and deliver them.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Tim Culpan in Taipei at  tculpan1@bloomberg.net .
