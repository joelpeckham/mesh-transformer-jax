 "context": "The following article called 'Apple Got Special Treatment for Grand Central Lease, Audit Says' was published on 2012-07-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc., (AAPL)  the world\u2019s biggest\ncompany by market value, was given an inside track to win a\nlease for a store in Grand Central Terminal by the  Metropolitan\nTransportation Authority , an audit by New York Comptroller\n Thomas DiNapoli  found.  Apple and MTA officials negotiated the lease for more than\na year before the agency asked companies for proposals on\nfilling the space, according to the audit, which DiNapoli\nreleased today. Before that request was released in May 2011,\nApple and Metrazur, a restaurant then occupying the space, had\nalready entered a $5 million buyout pact, the auditors found.\nThe MTA then required companies bidding for the space to pay the\nsame amount upfront.  \u201cThe MTA set a troubling precedent when it played\nfavorites and gave Apple a competitive edge over others,\u201d\nDiNapoli said in a statement.  DiNapoli said he performed the audit as a follow-up to a\n2010 review of the real estate practices at the MTA, whose 8.5\nmillion daily riders make it the biggest U.S. transit agency. It\noperates  New York City \u2019s subways, buses and the Long Island Rail\nRoad and Metro-North rail lines. The previous audit found MTA\u2019s\nreal-estate division didn\u2019t regularly use a competitive process\nto market rental properties.  MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said in a statement that the\naudit wasn\u2019t accurate and didn\u2019t account for how high-profile\ncommercial real estate works.  \u2018Worthless\u2019 Opinion  \u201cThe MTA\u2019s lease process with Apple was open, transparent\nand followed both the spirit and letter of the law,\u201d Lhota\nsaid. \u201cThis audit is not fact-based, and accordingly, the\nauditors\u2019 opinion is worthless.\u201d  In a letter to DiNapoli\u2019s office attached to the audit,\nJeffrey Rosen, the MTA\u2019s real-estate director, said the agency\nintervened in negotiations between Apple and Metrazur because it\nsaw an opportunity to have the restaurant surrender its lease\nalmost 10 years early so Apple could take over and pay higher\nrent. Under Metrazur\u2019s lease, which ran through 2019, the\nrestaurant paid $263,997 annually, about a quarter of what Apple\nis paying, the letter said.  Metrazur was demanding that the lease be bought out and the\nsum be included in new proposals for the space, Rosen wrote.\nGiven those circumstances, \u201cthis situation was highly\nunusual,\u201d Rosen wrote.  Michaela Wilkinson, a spokeswoman for Cupertino,\nCalifornia-based Apple, maker of the iPad and iPhone, declined\nto comment.
