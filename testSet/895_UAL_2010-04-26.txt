 "context": "The following article called 'UAL, Continental Merger Talks Said to Hinge on Stock Ratio' was published on 2010-04-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUAL Corp.\u2019s United Airlines and\nContinental Airlines Inc. are at odds over how to value their\nplanned no-premium stock merger, with negotiations focused on\nwhat time period to use for the stock-swap ratio, said three\npeople familiar with the situation.  \n Continental prefers a ratio based on stock prices before\nApril 7 reports that United was in merger talks, said two of the\npeople, who declined to be identified because the discussions\nare private. United, whose stock has outperformed Continental\u2019s\nsince then, is pushing for a later date, they said.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  United Chief Executive Officer Glenn Tilton and Continental\nCEO Jeffery Smisek are working on details of an accord after\nreaching a tentative agreement on some points, the people said.\nIn the plan under discussion, Tilton would become chairman of\nthe combined company and Smisek would be CEO, the people said.  \n \u201cBoth sides probably want to feel like they\u2019re doing some\nsort of haggling,\u201d said Vicki Bryan, a debt analyst at New\nYork-based Gimme Credit LLC. \u201cThey would benefit almost equally\nfrom this merger, and both of them have a lot at risk if this\nfalls through.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Continental\u2019s shares were worth about 1.08 times United\u2019s\nshares on April 7, and United\u2019s rally caused that ratio to slip\nto about 0.96 as of April 23.  \n Today\u2019s Trading  \n The ratio today was 1.03, as Continental rose 98 cents, or\n4.5 percent, to $22.99 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange\ncomposite trading, while UAL slid 63 cents, or 2.7 percent, to\n$22.36 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. UAL will report first-quarter\nfinancial results tomorrow morning.  \n Continental rose 98 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $22.99 at 4\np.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while UAL\nslid 63 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $22.36 on the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket. UAL and Continental gained 18 percent and 12 percent\nrespectively from April 7 through today.  \n \u201cThe market is taking a look at the stories and thinking\nthat there is a chance that Continental will get more of a\npremium than previously thought if there is a merger\nagreement,\u201d Jim Corridore, a Standard & Poor\u2019s equity analyst,\nsaid today in an interview. \u201cThat would be more costly for\nUnited, pushing United down.\u201d  \n Corridore, who is based in New York, rates Continental as a\n\u201cstrong buy\u201d and recommends holding shares of UAL.  \n At stake with the ratio negotiations is $200 million or\nmore of market value in the merged company to which each side\nlays claim. The airlines\u2019 combined stock market values were\nabout $6.9 billion as of April 23, and the dispute may amount to\n4 percent or more of that total.  \n $23-Per-Share Deal  \n Because the shares of both companies have been trading\naround $20 to $23 over the past couple weeks, \u201cit looks like\nthe market thinks this is a $23-per-share deal,\u201d Bryan said.  \n On April 23, Continental\u2019s Smisek and United CEO Tilton\nspoke to discuss the exchange ratio, said one person briefed on\nthe matter. The executives failed to resolve their differences\non that call or on a subsequent one, though they plan to\nnegotiate further, this person said.  \n \u201cI don\u2019t think either carrier wants to walk away from this\ndeal or let it fall apart over $2 or $3 a share,\u201d Bryan said.  \n David Messing, a spokesman for Houston-based Continental,\ndeclined to comment as did Jean Medina, a spokeswoman for\nChicago-based United.  \n After the end of regular trading on April 7, the New York\nTimes first reported merger talks between United and US Airways\nGroup Inc. Discussions between Continental and UAL began after\nthat, people with knowledge of the conversations have said.  \n US Airways Talks  \n US Airways called off its negotiations with United last\nweek. The Tempe, Arizona-based carrier halted the discussions\nbecause it concluded United favored a Continental tie-up, people\nclose to the talks have said.  \n United and Continental are the third- and fourth-largest\nU.S. airlines by traffic, and together they would surpass Delta\nAir Lines Inc., which took the No. 1 spot by buying Northwest\nAirlines Corp. in 2008. Broader route networks help airlines\nfunnel in more passengers.  \n Blending their route systems would produce two hubs at U.S.\nEast Coast business centers, United\u2019s at Washington Dulles and\nContinental\u2019s at Newark, New Jersey. United\u2019s routes include\nflights between Washington and Moscow, a city not served by\nContinental.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nZachary R.
