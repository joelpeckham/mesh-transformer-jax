 "context": "The following article called 'Spanish Notes Lead Slump as German Yields Fall to Records' was published on 2012-04-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSpanish notes led a decline in the\ndebt of  Europe \u2019s higher-yielding nations and German yields slid\nto records on concern a slowing global economy will deepen the\nregion\u2019s debt crisis.  Ten-year German bunds, Europe\u2019s benchmark government\nsecurities, outperformed all euro-area peers on bets that\n European Central Bank  loans are proving insufficient to stop the\ncrisis from spreading through the region. A Swiss sale of six-\nmonth bills drew a negative yield as investors sought\nalternative assets to euro-area debt. U.S. and U.K. bonds\nrallied as stocks fell after a report on April 6 showed weaker-\nthan-forecast U.S. job growth.  \u201cWe have a renewed concern in the euro region as the debt\nproblem hasn\u2019t gone away despite the liquidity support from the\nEuropean Central Bank,\u201d said  Vincent Chaigneau , the global head\nof interest-rate strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris. \u201cThe\npoor non-farm payroll data out of the U.S. only exacerbated the\nrisk-off sentiment. Peripheral bond yields are likely to\ncontinue to rise in the near term.\u201d  Spain\u2019s five-year note yield jumped 31 basis points, or\n0.31 percentage point, to 4.93 percent at 4:13 p.m. London time,\nthe highest since Jan. 9. The 4.25 percent securities maturing\nin October 2016 fell 1.205, or 12.05 euros per 1,000-euro\n($1,307) face amount, to 97.28.  The nation\u2019s 10-year bonds dropped for a fourth day,\nsending the yield 23 basis points higher to 5.99 percent, the\nmost since Dec. 12. That increased the additional yield\ninvestors demand to hold the securities over similar-maturity\nbunds by 33 basis points to 435 basis points.  German Records  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area\nmarkets followed by  Italy , according to measures of 10-year\nbonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.\nThe change in the yield was 2.7 times the 90-day average.  Spanish 10-year yields have risen to the most since the ECB\nstarted providing three-year loans in December in its longer-\nterm refinancing operations.  Germany \u2019s 10-year yield fell 10 basis points to 1.64\npercent, approaching its all-time low of 1.636 percent set on\nSept. 23. The five-year yield declined 10 basis points to 0.617\npercent, the least on record.  German two-year  note yields  dropped five basis points to\n0.093 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began collecting the\ndata in 1990. The rate slid below its Japanese peer for the\nfirst time, based on closing-market data.  Spanish Banks  Spain \u2019s government yesterday repeated its pledge to reduce\nthe nation\u2019s deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product next\nyear. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  met health and education\nministers to discuss spending cuts of more than 10 billion\neuros.  Spanish banks may need additional capital if the economy\n\u201cworsens more than expected,\u201d Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said in  Madrid  today, as he said the\nrecovery will be slow. If the economy \u201cfinally recovers, what\nhas been done will be more than enough,\u201d he said.  Treasury 10-year yields fell below 2 percent for the first\ntime in almost one month and U.K. gilt yields for similar-\nmaturity securities dropped to 2.01 percent, the least since\nFeb. 28. The MSCI World Index of shares slid 0.7 percent.  Italian 10-year yields rose 24 basis points to 5.69\npercent, pushing the yield spread to bunds to more than 400\nbasis points for the first time since Feb. 16.  U.S. Payrolls  U.S. payrolls increased by 120,000 in March, the Labor\nDepartment said on April 6. That\u2019s the fewest in five months and\nless than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News\nsurvey. The  U.S. economy  is still \u201cfar from having fully\nrecovered\u201d from the financial crisis, Federal Reserve Chairman\n Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech yesterday.  Demand for bunds was also supported after a Chinese report\nshowed import growth trailed forecasts, underscoring risks of a\ndeeper slowdown in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.  The French  yield spread  over bunds widened to as much as\n136 basis points, from 125 basis points last week, the most\nsince Jan. 18 after a report today showed the nation\u2019s\nmanufacturing production slid 1.2 percent in February, a third\nmonth of declines.  France  sold 7.8 billion euros of bills maturing in 84, 175\nand 357 days. It auctioned the 175-day bills at an average yield\nof 0.119 percent, compared to an average yield of minus 0.251\npercent in  Switzerland \u2019s sale of 182-day government bills.\n Austria  and the Netherlands also auctioned debt today.  German bunds returned 14 percent in the past year and 0.7\npercent in 2012, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and\nthe European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French\nbonds gained 8.9 percent during the past 12 months, with Spanish\nsecurities returning 3.3 percent in the period, the indexes\nshow.
