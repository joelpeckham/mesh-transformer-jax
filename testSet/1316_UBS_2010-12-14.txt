 "context": "The following article called 'Genoptix Said to Seek Sale, Hire Barclays to Run Auction to Find Buyers' was published on 2010-12-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGenoptix  Inc., a cancer testing\ncompany, put itself up for sale, said two people with knowledge\nof the process. The shares gained 17 percent.  Genoptix hired Barclays Plc to run an auction, said the\npeople, who declined to be identified because the matter is\nprivate. Genoptix, based in Carlsbad, California, had a market\nvalue of about $369 million at the close of trading today.  Genoptix provides laboratory tests and services to doctors\nfor diagnosing cancer. Sales have been hurt by unemployment in\nthe U.S, which has reduced the number of patients seeking care\nfrom blood specialists and cancer doctors who use the tests,\nsaid  Amanda Murphy , an analyst at William Blair & Co. in\nChicago.  \u201cGiven the recent difficulties the company has faced from\na competitive standpoint and the recent increase in M&A\ntransactions in the lab space, I am not surprised Genoptix would\nbe seeking alternative options,\u201d Murphy said in an e-mail.  Genoptix increased $3 to $20.98 at 4 p.m. New York time in\nNasdaq Stock Market composite trading, for the biggest single-\nday gain since Nov. 7, 2008. The  stock  fell 49 percent this year\nbefore today.  Genoptix is currently trading at  7.8 times earnings  before\ninterest, tax, depreciation and amortization, higher than the\nmedian premium of 6.1 times ebitda paid for publicly traded U.S.\ndiagnostics companies acquired over the past five years.  Quest, Sonic  Quest Diagnostics Inc. , based in Madison, New Jersey, and\nSydney-based  Sonic Healthcare Ltd.  are among companies that may\nbe interested in acquiring Genoptix, Murphy said.  \u201cAs a policy, we do not comment on rumors or speculation\nabout M&A activity,\u201d Wendy Bost, a Quest Diagnostics\nspokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Colin Goldschmidt , Sonic\nHealthcare\u2019s chief executive, didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail\nseeking comment.  Marcy Graham , executive director of investor relations for\nGenoptix, declined to comment in a telephone interview.  The market for specialized medical tests is about $1.5\nbillion, Murphy said. Genoptix reported  net income  of $30.6\nmillion on revenue of $184 million last year. \u201cComplicating any\nsale is the dramatic company growth deceleration and long-term\nquestions on pricing stability,\u201d  Stephen Shankman , an analyst\nat UBS Investment Research in New York, wrote in a note to\ninvestors yesterday.  Genoptix\u2019s sales may grow only 5.5 percent, to $194.5\nmillion in 2010 after jumping nearly 59 percent in 2009,\nShankman said in his note.  There have been 185 acquisitions in the U.S. medical lab\nand test services business in the past five years, with an\naverage disclosed price of $66.5 million, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Sonic was the industry\u2019s busiest\npurchaser, announcing seven U.S.  acquisitions  during that time.
