The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmbac Assurance Corp. sued  Bank of\nAmerica Corp.  in  New York  state court, accusing the company of\nbreach of contract over a mortgage-backed securitization\nsponsored by its Merrill Lynch unit.  First Franklin Financial Corp. and Merrill Lynch units\n\u201cacted in concert\u201d to induce Ambac to issue an insurance\npolicy covering payments due on securities issued in the\ntransaction, the bond insurer said in the complaint.  Ambac claimed fraudulent inducement and breach of contract\nin the suit, filed today in  Manhattan . Lawrence Grayson, a\nspokesman for Charlotte-based Bank of America, declined to\ncomment on the lawsuit.  The insurer asked for unspecified punitive and compensatory\ndamages and an order directing the defendants to repurchase\nloans. First Franklin was a subprime-mortgage originator\nacquired in 2006 by Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by Bank of\nAmerica in 2008.  Ambac Assurance was the second-largest bond insurer before\nthe 2008 financial crisis, when defaults on mortgages swamped\nthe company with claims. It guaranteed about $256 billion of\n$1.4 trillion in insured municipal debt, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Plan Approved  A U.S. bankruptcy judge in Manhattan on March 15 approved a\nplan to reorganize the $1.7 billion in debt of New York-based\n Ambac Financial Group Inc. (ABKFQ) , the bankrupt holding company for\nAmbac Assurance.  The  mortgage loans  securitized in the transaction began to\ndefault at an \u201cextraordinary rate\u201d shortly after closing and\nloans accounting for about 74 percent of the original principal\nbalance of the trust have defaulted, lawyers for Ambac said in\nthe complaint.  About 15,812 subprime, second-lien fixed-rate mortgages\nwith an aggregate principal balance of about $856 million were\nsecuritized in the transaction, lawyers for Ambac said in the\nlawsuit.  A consultant found \u201cbreaches of representations and\nwarranties\u201d in about 94 percent of 1,750 loans in the trust,\nincluding misrepresentations of borrowers\u2019 income and\nemployment, inflated appraisals and violations of underwriting\nguidelines.  \u2018Enormous Damages\u2019  Ambac has made \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in claim\npayments to cover the defaults and has suffered \u201cenormous\ndamages\u201d from the investment, according to the lawsuit.  Ambac has also filed similar lawsuits in the same court\nagainst  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Credit Suisse Group AG over\nmortgage-backed securities, pools of home loans securitized into\nbonds that were a central part of the housing bubble that helped\nsend the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s.  The case is Ambac Assurance Corp. v. First Franklin\nFinancial Corp., 651217/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New\nYork County (Manhattan).
