 "context": "The following article called 'Health Management CEO Exit Stokes Takeover Talk: Real M&A' was published on 2013-06-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHealth Management Associates Inc. (HMA) ,\nfacing a leadership change and potential pressure from its\nbiggest shareholder, is becoming one of the hottest subjects of\nmerger speculation among U.S. stocks.  The operator of rural American hospitals surged 25 percent\nlast week, more than almost every Russell 3000 Index stock and\nenough to drive Health Management\u2019s  price-earnings ratio  to a\nlevel last seen in 2009, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. The rally came amid optimism shareholder Glenview\nCapital Management LLC may spur a sale and after Health\nManagement said its chief executive officer will retire.  The CEO  shift  amid government investigations could lead to\na sale of the $3.6 billion company, Royal Bank of Canada said.\nBoth RBC and shareholder Snow Capital Management LP see\n Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH) , which said last week that it\u2019s\nopen to friendly mergers, as the most logical suitor. At\nSusquehanna International Group LLP\u2019s estimated price of about\n$18.50 a share, a deal would be the biggest in the health-care-services industry since 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \u201cHMA\u2019s CEO resigned and their board needs to do something\nfor shareholders,\u201d Joshua Schachter, a  money manager  at\nSewickley, Pennsylvania-based Snow Capital, said in a telephone\ninterview, referring to Health Management by its stock ticker.\nSnow Capital oversees more than $3 billion, including shares of\n Community Health  and Health Management. \u201cShareholders of HMA\nwould really welcome a deal to be with the good management team\nof Community.\u201d  Florida Focus  MaryAnn Hodge, a spokeswoman for Health Management,\ndeclined to comment on whether the company would be open to a\nsale or had held conversations with potential buyers. Scott Tagliarino, a spokesman for New York-based Glenview, declined to\ncomment on whether the investor would support a deal.  Health Management runs 71 hospitals with about 11,100 beds.\nThe company, which has almost a third of its locations in\n Florida , had $5.9 billion of net  revenue  in 2012.  Last month, shareholder Glenview Capital began reporting\nits 14.6 percent stake on a form 13D, a U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission document usually reserved for activist\nholdings. In a May 24 filing that mentioned the shift, Health\nManagement said it adopted a takeover defense because the\ninvestor had sought regulatory approval to purchase as much as\n$2.2 billion of stock -- at the time, about a 75 percent stake.  Glenview responded on May 28, saying it had \u201cno present\nintention or future plan\u201d to purchase that much stock. Glenview\nalso said it hoped to continue private discussions with Health\nManagement.  Spurring Rally  The stock  jumped  6.9 percent on May 28 after the statements\nfrom Health Management and Glenview as well as a report from\nLazard Capital Markets LLC that said the investor may desire a\nsale of the company. After the market closed that day, Health\nManagement said Gary Newsome will retire as CEO and leave the\nboard on July 31, fueling even more gains for the stock -- which\nrose 25 percent between May 24 and May 31.  It was the 10th-biggest weekly increase in the Russell 3000\nIndex during the period and also Health Management\u2019s biggest\nadvance since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Today, the shares rose 2 percent to $14.19 at 9:56 a.m. New\nYork time, climbing for the ninth straight day. That\u2019s the\nlongest streak of gains since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg\nshow. The rally has pushed Health Management\u2019s  price-earnings\nratio  to greater than 20, the most expensive valuation in more\nthan three years, the data show.  Market\u2019s Bet  \u201cThe market obviously thinks the company is in play,\u201d\nJohn Ransom, an analyst at  St. Petersburg , Florida-based Raymond\nJames Financial Inc., said in a phone interview. \u201cYou had the\npoison pill and then you had the CEO resign in rapid\nsuccession.\u201d  Community Health is the most logical suitor for Health\nManagement, said Schachter of Snow Capital. Community Health\nowns, leases or operates 135 hospitals with about 20,000 beds\nand posted $13 billion of net revenue in 2012.  The Franklin, Tennessee-based hospital operator is\ninterested in buying complementary companies of a \u201cdecent\nsize,\u201d though it probably wouldn\u2019t pursue hostile deals, Chief\nFinancial Officer W. Larry Cash said at a conference last week.  Tomi Galin, a spokeswoman for Community Health, didn\u2019t\nrespond to a phone message or e-mail seeking comment.  Health Management \u201cwould significantly add to earnings for\nCommunity,\u201d Schachter said in a phone interview. A combination\nwould be \u201ca perfect fit.\u201d  Also, their operations don\u2019t significantly overlap\ngeographically, said Gary Lieberman, a New York-based analyst at\nWells Fargo & Co.  Takeover Price  Chris Rigg, a New York-based analyst at Susquehanna, said\nin a report last week that Health Management could fetch about\n$18.50 a share in a takeover.  That would give the company an enterprise value of $8.4\nbillion, making a deal the fourth-biggest on record for a\nhealth-care-services provider, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nIt would be the largest purchase since a group of private-equity\nfirms purchased HCA Inc. in 2006 for more than $30 billion, the\ndata show.  Private-equity firms could also be tempted to bid on Health\nManagement, lured by the opportunity to cash in on an influx of\nnewly insured patients from the U.S. Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act, said Frank Morgan, an analyst at RBC.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a private-equity investor, you might look at\nHMA as an investment vehicle to get a really big portfolio of\nassets in one fell swoop,\u201d Morgan said in a phone interview.  Expanding Footprint  HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) , as HCA is now known after its 2011\ninitial public offering, and  Tenet Healthcare Corp. (THC)  could be\ninterested in Health Management to expand their footprints in\nFlorida, said Whit Mayo, a Nashville, Tennessee-based analyst at\nRobert W. Baird & Co.  \u201cYou can get better leverage, better pricing,\u201d Mayo said\nin a phone interview. \u201cThere are some strategic reasons why\nthis would make a lot of sense.\u201d  Ed Fishbough, a spokesman for Nashville-based HCA, and Rick Black of Dallas-based Tenet declined to comment on whether their\ncompanies would seek to buy Health Management. The two companies\nhave market values of $18 billion and $4.9 billion,\nrespectively.  Still, Health Management may not be interested in selling,\nMayo said. Also, potential legal costs or the prospect of\nbusiness disruptions stemming from Health Management\u2019s\ngovernment investigations could deter buyers, said  Sheryl Skolnick , a  Stamford , Connecticut-based analyst at CRT Capital\nGroup LLC.  \u2018Highly Problematic\u2019  Health Management said on May 2 that the SEC was reviewing\nits accounting procedures, including payments from Medicare and\nMedicaid, the U.S. health programs for the elderly and poor.  \u201cHMA is highly problematic as a takeout candidate\u201d\nbecause of the inquiries, Skolnick said in a phone interview.  Community Health, which has faced its own government\ninvestigations, may not be turned off by Health Management\u2019s\npotential legal issues, Schachter of Snow Capital said.  \u201cThat\u2019s part of the business and being in this industry,\u201d\nhe said.  With Health Management juggling both the investigations and\na CEO search, now could be the time for the company to evaluate\noptions including a sale, RBC\u2019s Morgan said.  \u201cThere are not many portfolios of this size that come to\nmarket very often,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that that\u2019s one of\nthe options they explore, certainly there would be people that\nwould absolutely look at it.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nBrooke Sutherland in  New York  at \n bsutherland7@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSarah Rabil at \n srabil@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HCA Holdings, Inc. was 37.798011779785156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HCA Holdings, Inc. was ",
