The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTurkey  bond  yields  fell to the\nlowest in more than eight months on bets of a rate cut this year\nand an upgrade in sovereign  credit rating . The  central bank \nextended funding at its minimum policy rate for an 18th\nconsecutive day, lowering borrowing costs.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt slid for a second day,\ndown 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 8.65 percent\nat the close in Istanbul, the weakest level since Oct. 18.  Turkey\u2019s  inflation  rate slipped to 8.3 percent last month\nfrom a three-year high of 11.1 percent as the central bank\nraised the average cost of funding to 9.8 percent in May from\n8.3 percent in April. Oil slumped 28 percent from this year\u2019s\npeak in February, helping the  current-account deficit  contract\nfor a sixth month in April. Capacity utilization slid to 74.6\npercent in June from 76.7 percent a year earlier, according to a\ncentral bank report June 25.  \u201cWe believe that the central bank will cut policy rates in\nthe last quarter of the year with more favorable inflation\nconditions,\u201d Bora Tamer Yilmaz, vice president at Halk\nSecurities in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed note. Capacity\nutilization data shows the economy failed to gain momentum in\nthe second quarter, he said.  The government expects economic growth to retreat to 4\npercent this year from last year\u2019s 8.5 percent, the fastest\namong major economies after  China  and  Argentina . Two-year cross-\ncurrency swaps declined to 6.89 percent, the lowest level since\nOct. 19 and down from 8.19 percent May 15, signaling traders are\nbetting on a rate cut. Turkey meets almost all of its energy\nneeds through imports.  Cheaper Borrowing Costs  The central bank lent 1 billion liras ($552.3 million) at\n5.75 percent in its one-week repurchase agreements auction\ntoday. The provision of liquidity at the minimum funding rate\nfor the 18th straight day is the longest stretch since March.  The bank executes its monetary policy through a rates\ncorridor introduced in October. It adjusts borrowing costs\nbetween 5.75 percent and 11.5 percent daily to control credit\ngrowth and the current-account deficit while reining in\ninflation.  The benchmark bond yields have fallen 66 basis points in\nthe second quarter, extending the decline in the previous three\nmonths.  \u201cBond yields are falling fast with the central bank\nincreasing its funding and the cost of funding in the market\nfalling,\u201d Onur Bayol, an Istanbul-based fixed income and\ncurrency trader at Denizbank AS, said in e-mailed comments.  Ratings Upgrade Bets  Moody\u2019s Investors Service upgraded Turkey\u2019s credit rating\nto one level below investment grade June 20. The move to Ba1 had\n\u201ctwo main drivers: the significant improvement that we\u2019ve\nobserved in Turkey\u2019s public finances and our observation that\nthe government has improved its shock absorption capacity,\u201d\nMoody\u2019s analyst  Sarah Carlson  said from  London  after the ratings\naction.  \u201cExpectations of an upgrade from a rating agency is\nsupporting today\u2019s purchases in the  bond market  in addition to\nexpectations that inflation will fall in the next two months and\nwe will close this year around 7,\u201d Murat Yardimci, head of\ntrading at ING Bank, in Istanbul said in e-mailed comments.  Fitch Ratings  ranks Turkey at BB+, one step below\ninvestment grade with a stable outlook.  Standard & Poor\u2019s  cut\nthe outlook on Turkey\u2019s debt to stable from positive on May 1,\nmaintaining its BB rating, two steps below investment grade.
