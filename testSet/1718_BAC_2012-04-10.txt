The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNew York Attorney General  Eric Schneiderman  renewed his opposition to  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) \u2019s\nproposed $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement, saying the deal\ncovers \u201ca small fraction\u201d of investor losses.  Schneiderman\u2019s office asked a New York state judge today to\nallow it to intervene in the case, saying in a court filing that\nthere are \u201cserious questions about the fairness and adequacy of\nthe proposed settlement.\u201d  \u201cThe proposed cash payment represents only a tiny\npercentage of the losses investors have faced and will continue\nto face,\u201d the attorney general said.  Schneiderman\u2019s request comes after litigation over the\nsettlement was sent back to state court from federal court for\nconsideration. He previously raised objections to the agreement\nand won approval from a federal judge to intervene and\nparticipate in the case.  The settlement would resolve claims from investors in\n Countrywide Financial Corp. (CFC)  mortgage bonds. Bank of America\nacquired the mortgage lender in 2008.  Bank of New York Mellon \nCorp., as trustee for investors, is seeking approval of the deal\nin state court.  Removed Claims  The attorney general\u2019s office said in a letter today to New\nYork State Justice Barbara Kapnick, who is overseeing the case,\nthat it has been unable to reach an agreement on the\nintervention with other parties in the case.  In its court filing, the attorney general removed claims\nfirst filed last year against  BNY Mellon  over its role as\ntrustee and will no longer pursue them as part of the\nCountrywide settlement, Danny Kanner, a spokesman for\nSchneiderman, said.  \u201cWe have separated our affirmative claims from our\nintervention motion, and intend to aggressively pursue the\nstate\u2019s interest through every means available, including\nfurther investigation and litigation if necessary,\u201d Kanner\nsaid.  Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to\ncomment on the attorney general\u2019s filing. Kevin Heine, a\nspokesman for BNY Mellon, didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail seeking\ncomment.
