 "context": "The following article called 'Ford Pursues Blast-Proof Vehicles Contracts' was published on 2012-01-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFord Motor Co. (F)  is leading a push by\ncommercial-truck makers to challenge defense contractors for a\npotential $54 billion in work replacing U.S. military Humvees\nwith blast-proof all-terrain vehicles.  The Army and Marine Corps plan to open competition Jan. 20\nin the second development phase for their Joint Light Tactical\nVehicle. Truck manufacturers Ford,  Navistar International Corp. (NAV) \nand  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK)  may take on teams led by defense companies\n General Dynamics Corp. (GD) ,  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  and  BAE Systems\nPlc (BAESY)  that won the three first-stage contracts.  Congress added language to this year\u2019s defense spending\nbill prodding the military to embrace \u201coff-the-shelf technology\ndemonstrated by industry\u201d to develop vehicles that can better\nprotect troops from improvised explosive devices. Ford has met\nwith aides on  Capitol Hill  and Pentagon officials to pitch its\ncase for building the battle-ready trucks and bypassing the\nusual acquisition process.  The effort by Ford, the second-biggest U.S. automaker, \u201cis\na very intriguing strategic move,\u201d  Brian Johnson , an auto\nindustry analyst for Barclays Capital Inc. in  Chicago , said in\nan interview. \u201cThe benefits are finding an additional market\nfor your most profitable vehicles, such as large pickup trucks,\nespecially at a time when the retail demand is at the mercy of\ngas prices.\u201d  The pressure to use commercially available parts or\nprototypes may be a harbinger for ground programs that survive\nplanned defense spending cuts of at least $490 billion during\nthe next decade as the Obama administration places added\nemphasis on air and sea power in the Pacific.  55,500 Vehicles  Defense contractors counter that effective troop protection\ncan\u2019t be bolted on to a commercial truck design.  \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that there is an off-the-shelf\ncommercial vehicle today that will fulfill the requirements of\nthe JLTV program,\u201d Kathryn Hasse, a program director for\nLockheed, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to use a\ncommercial chassis to do it. The reality is, it\u2019s just not\nrugged enough.\u201d  Lockheed\u2019s design incorporates off-the-shelf equipment\nwhere appropriate, including a diesel engine by  Cummins Inc. (CMI)  and\na transmission by  Allison Transmission Inc. (ALSN) , she said.  The Army and Marine Corps together plan to buy about 55,500\nnew vehicles to replace some of about 175,000 High Mobility\nMultipurpose Wheeled Vehicles built by AM General LLC. The\nHumvees proved to be vulnerable to inexpensive improvised\nexplosives in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In a presentation circulated in November on Capitol Hill, a\nteam led by Ford proposed bearing the full cost of about $400\nmillion to build production-ready prototypes without the\ngovernment funding normally awarded during the development\nprocess. It said its vehicle would provide better protection to\ntroops at a lower price and weight than competitors.  Lockheed\u2019s Design  Almost two-thirds of all U.S. casualties in  Iraq  and\nAfghanistan were caused by bombs and explosive devices,\nincluding more than 3,000 troops killed and more than 31,000\ninjured, according to Pentagon statistics through Jan. 3. Many\nof the incidents involved attacks against vehicles.  \u201cWe\u2019re coming back mangled and just beat up, missing\nlimbs, and we need the right tools, the right vehicles, out\nthere for it,\u201d said Octavio Sanchez, who as a Marine staff\nsergeant was critically injured in Ramadi, Iraq, in 2005 when\nthe Humvee he was riding in struck a roadside bomb.  Sanchez, who lost his right hand and part of his left and\nsuffered third-degree burns to 67 percent of his body, now works\nfor Hardwire LLC, the maker of a \u201cblast chimney\u201d that channels\nthe force of explosives to better protect Humvee occupants.  Less Weight  The Pentagon spent more than $44 billion to build heavier\ntrucks known as mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles, or\nMRAPs, to better protect troops from roadside blasts in Iraq and\nAfghanistan.  The new light truck is intended to weigh about 20,000\npounds (9,072 kilograms) fully loaded and offer protection\ncomparable to that of the MRAP, which can weigh 30,000 to 50,000\npounds, too heavy for many roads and bridges in Afghanistan, or\nto travel off-road. Empty, the new vehicle would be light enough\nto be carried by CH-47 Chinook and CH-53 Super Stallion\nhelicopters and on ship decks.  The Senate Appropriations Committee in September sought to\ncancel the program, citing \u201cexcessive cost growth.\u201d The\nservices worked together to simplify the design to a single base\nmodel; lower the targeted manufacturing cost to $230,000 to\n$270,000 per vehicle, excluding armor kits; and shorten\nengineering and manufacturing development to about 32 months\nfrom 48 months.  The updated strategy aims \u201cto give industry greater\nlatitude to demonstrate what\u2019s achievable on a light platform,\u201d\nArmy Colonel David Bassett, project manager of tactical vehicles\nin Warren, Michigan, said in an e-mail.  Three Contracts  Ford said it would need about 32 months to build prototypes\nbefore beginning government testing, about a year longer than\nthe military may require.  The Army plans in June to award as many as three contracts,\neach valued at as much as $65 million, for a total of $195\nmillion, for the engineering and manufacturing development\nphase, according to Bassett.  That\u2019s in addition to the $217 million the Army already\nawarded for technology development, including $74.6 million to\nGeneral Tactical Vehicles, a joint venture of  Falls Church ,\nVirginia-based General Dynamics and AM General of South Bend,\nIndiana; $77.4 million to London-based BAE Systems; and $65.4\nmillion to Lockheed of Bethesda, Maryland, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Raytheon, Alliant  Ford, which was among the builders of the military\u2019s Jeep\nfor World War II and the Vietnam-era M151 truck, left the market\nin the 1980s when the Pentagon started buying Humvees from AM\nGeneral.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker, which is second in\nU.S. sales behind  General Motors (GM)  Co., was part of a team led by\ndefense contractor  SAIC Inc. (SAI)  that lost its bid for the new\nvehicle\u2019s initial technology development phase in 2008.  Now, Ford plans to join with defense contractors including\n Raytheon Co. (RTN)  of Waltham, Massachusetts, and  Alliant Techsystems\nInc. (ATK)  of Arlington,  Virginia , according to information from the\npresentation distributed on Capitol Hill.  The Ford model\u2019s curb weight, not counting passengers or\nequipment, would be 10,600 pounds. A combat-ready vehicle would\ncost less than $250,000, according to the presentation given by\nFord and Future Force Innovation Inc., a closely held company in\n New York  led by Robert Linton. Linton declined to comment for\nthis article.  Ford\u2019s \u2018Long History\u2019  Ford has a \u201clong history of working with the government\nand we continue to look at new ideas and projects,\u201d Mike\nLevine, the company\u2019s manager of truck communications, said in\nan interview. Levine declined to comment on Ford\u2019s intentions\nregarding the military vehicle or on the presentation.  Prototypes of similar vehicles were on display in October\nat the annual conference of the Association of the United States\nArmy in  Washington , including the Light All-Terrain Vehicle made\nby Oshkosh, which has spent more than $60 million developing it,\naccording to John Urias, president of the Oshkosh, Wisconsin-\nbased company\u2019s defense segment.  Oshkosh, which was founded in 1917 and made commercial\nvehicles such as fire trucks and snowplows for most of its\nhistory, has become the Pentagon\u2019s leading supplier of heavy-\nduty, medium-duty and light tactical trucks, including mine-\nresistant vehicles.  Ford may use its work on military trucks to \u201cpush their\ndesign and engineering thinking,\u201d improving towing capacity and\noff-road mobility for its  pickup trucks , Johnson, the auto\nindustry analyst, said. Ford can tap into its purchasing power\nas the manufacturer of more than 5 million vehicles a year with\na global  supply chain , according to its presentation.
