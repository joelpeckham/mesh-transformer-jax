 "context": "The following article called 'Anti-Japan Protests Raise Risks for China\u2019s Leadership Shift' was published on 2012-09-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDemonstrations across  China  against\nJapanese businesses and property pose a growing risk for the\ncountry\u2019s leaders as the economy slows and the Communist Party\nprepares for a once-a-decade transition of power.  With growth in danger of reaching a 22-year low, ousted\nPolitburo member Bo Xilai\u2019s case still pending public resolution\nand the biggest diplomatic spat with  Japan  since 2005, any\nuncontrolled protests risk undermining authority before the\nhandover. Thousands waved flags and brandished Mao Zedong\nportraits yesterday at Japanese diplomatic posts in Beijing and\n Shanghai  in a sign of public fury over a territorial dispute.  \u201cThey do not want things to get out of control; there will\nbe more attempts to contain the protests,\u201d said  Joseph Cheng , a\npolitical science professor at the  City University  of  Hong Kong .\nThe portraits of Mao \u201care implicit criticisms of the present\nleadership,\u201d he said. Bo Xilai championed resurrection of Mao\nslogans before his downfall as Chongqing party boss this year.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Sony Corp. (6758)  and Fast Retailing Co. were\namong companies that halted operations in China after protesters\nattacked Japanese cars and shops. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) \nof stocks recorded its biggest back-to-back loss since March.  China regards organizations not sanctioned by the\ngovernment as illegal. Political protests, including those held\nby students in  Tiananmen Square  in 1989 and by practitioners of\nthe Falun Gong spiritual group a decade later, have been\nforcibly suppressed.  Orchestration Undermined  The smooth orchestration of China\u2019s leadership handover has\nbeen undermined by the downfall of Bo, whose wife was convicted\nlast month of murdering a British businessman. Wang Lijun, the\nformer Chongqing police chief whose flight to an American\ndiplomatic office in February triggered the country\u2019s biggest\npolitical crisis in two decades, yesterday confessed to\ndefecting after a two-day trial.  \u201cWhat the protests underscore is the level of frustration\nwithin society about many things: the slowing down of economic\ngrowth, the job market for young graduates,\u201d Jean-Pierre Cabestan, head of the department of government and international\nstudies at Hong Kong Baptist University, said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cAnd you have this opaque political system with\nleaders jockeying for position behind the curtain.\u201d  Xi Jinping, President  Hu Jintao \u2019s heir apparent,\ndisappeared from view for two weeks before re-emerging without\nexplanation on Sept. 15. The dearth of information prompted\nspeculation about his health and who else might oversee an\neconomy struggling to overcome a widening wealth gap.  Ambassador\u2019s Car  At the Japanese embassy in Beijing, protesters threw\nbottles and branches at the building\u2019s walls, which were\nspattered with eggs and paint. In Shanghai, protesters marched\nthrough the streets waving Chinese flags and shouting slogans\nsaying \u201cDown With the Japanese.\u201d  Demonstrators in the capital caused minor damage to the\nofficial vehicle of U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke yesterday as it\nwas about to enter the embassy grounds, spokesman Nolan\nBarkhouse said. Some of the people had Chinese flags and looked\nto be leaving protests taking place at the nearby Japanese\nembassy, said a U.S. official who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak\npublicly on the matter. Locke was in the car at the time of the\nincident, the official said.  The recent demonstrations escalated after Japan last week\npurchased the islands, called Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in\nJapanese, from a private Japanese owner. The islands have been\nunder Japanese administrative control since 1895.  Japanese Occupation  Some demonstrators said they were also protesting Japan\u2019s\nWorld War II occupation.  China Central Television  observed a\nmoment of silence yesterday to commemorate the 81st anniversary\nof the Manchurian Incident, a staged attack on a Japanese\nrailway that was used as an excuse to start an invasion that\nwould see Japan take control of much of China.  Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  last night said the\nanniversary was one reason for the demonstrations and said both\nsides must work to repair ties.  \u201cIf our relationship remains strained for a long period,\nit will be harmful not only to our two countries but to the\nregion and the world economy,\u201d he said on TBS Television. \u201cWe\nshould keep a cool head, but take a firm line. It is important\nto at least talk, exchange information and communicate.\u201d  The worst bilateral diplomatic crisis since 2005 is\nendangering a trade relationship that has tripled in the past\ndecade to more than $340 billion. Japanese retailers in China\nclosed their doors and covered up their logos as protests spread\nto dozens of cities.  Hot and Cold  The tensions complicate efforts to fortify growth in each\ncountry as  Europe \u2019s debt crisis saps demand for exports. China\nwas the largest market for Japanese exports in 2011, while Japan\nwas the fourth-largest market for Chinese exports.  \u201cSino-Japan relations are often described as hot in trade\nbut cold in politics, but now even the trade relationship is\ngetting cold,\u201d said Zhang Jifeng, a researcher with the\nInstitute of Japanese Studies at the  Chinese Academy of Social\nSciences  in Beijing. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell which side would suffer\nmore from the cooling trade, but it\u2019s sure that the pain will be\ndeep for both.\u201d  Shares of  Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , owner of the Uniqlo clothing\nbrand, fell the most in three months in  Tokyo  trading after the\ncompany closed 42 stores in China.  Seven & I Holdings Co. (3382)  closed\n211 stores and Aeon Jusco shut 30 outlets.  Prevent Harm  \u201cIf this dispute doesn\u2019t end soon, it could be a very\nserious problem for Japan, especially when global demand is\nslowing,\u201d said Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at JPMorgan\nSecurities Japan Co. \u201cJapan would also diversify foreign direct\ninvestment away from China to China\u2019s neighbors.\u201d  The Japanese government yesterday urged China to \u201ctake all\nmeasures to prevent any further harm to Japanese citizens or\ncompanies,\u201d Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told\nreporters in Tokyo.  Japan \u201ctotally caused\u201d the current crisis and should\n\u201ctake responsibility,\u201d Chinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie\ntold reporters in Beijing yesterday in a joint appearance with\nU.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta . \u201cWe will very closely\nwatch the evolution with regards to this dispute and we reserve\nthe right for further actions.\u201d  A Chinese fishing ban in waters surrounding the islands\nended Sept. 16, and Chinese and Japanese media aired footage of\nfishing vessels heading out to sea. The state-run China News\nService reported on Sept. 17 that 1,000 fishing boats typically\ngo to the region and the government would send more vessels than\nin recent years. Hong Kong-based activists may go to the region\nas early as today, the Apple Daily newspaper reported.  Fishing Boats  Fujimura said that while 10 Chinese patrol boats have been\nspotted in waters adjacent to Japan\u2019s territory, Japan has no\ninformation about the fishing boats. He confirmed yesterday that\ntwo Japanese temporarily landed on one of the islands. At least\ntwo Chinese vessels entered Japan\u2019s waters, NHK Television said\nlast night, citing the Coast Guard.  \u201cConsidering that Japanese companies make important\ncontributions to the Chinese economy and employment, people\nshould look at the broader picture and act calmly,\u201d Fujimura\nsaid.
