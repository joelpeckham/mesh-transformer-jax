 "context": "The following article called 'EON Quarterly Profit Rises 27% on Russia, Gas-Contract Gains' was published on 2012-05-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEON AG (EOAN) , Germany\u2019s biggest utility,\nsaid first-quarter profit rose 27 percent after the company\nrenegotiated natural-gas contracts and boosted sales in  Russia .  Underlying net income, the profit measure EON uses to\ncalculate its dividend, climbed to 1.7 billion euros ($2.2\nbillion) from 1.32 billion euros a year earlier, the company\nsaid today in a statement. That met the 1.68 billion-euro median\nestimate of six analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Earnings from the utility\u2019s trading division were about 400\nmillion euros higher than a year earlier, mainly because of the\nrenegotiation of a \u201csignificant percentage\u201d of long-term gas\ncontracts, EON said. New generating capacity in Russia also\nboosted profits, the company said. This helped to soften the\nimpact of reactor closures after  Chancellor Angela Merkel \nordered a phase-out from nuclear power.  \u201cWe\u2019re now past the worst,\u201d Chief Financial Officer\nMarcus Schenck said in the statement. \u201cWe\u2019re making good\nprogress. But we still need to be resolute about meeting our\ncurrent challenges and implementing the changes we\u2019ve\ninitiated.\u201d  EON has pursued a 15 billion-euro asset-sales program, job\ncuts and expansions in non-European markets including Brazil\nafter the Fukushima disaster in Japan prompted Merkel to call\nfor the permanent halt of all atomic plants by 2022. The first\nphase of shutdowns trimmed earnings by 2.5 billion euros in\n2011.  Renegotiated Contracts  EON said last week it renegotiated about two-thirds of its\nnatural-gas contracts after a March 13 agreement with Norwegian\nproducer  Statoil ASA (STL) , which accounts for about 25 percent of the\nDusseldorf-based company\u2019s supplies.  European utilities have sought changes to their purchase\ncontracts with Statoil and Russian gas-export monopoly OAO\nGazprom since an oversupply following the 2008 recession caused\nspot market prices in  Europe  to slump below long-term contract\nrates typically linked to  oil prices . EON and  RWE AG (RWE) , Germany\u2019s\nsecond-biggest utility, are in negotiations with Gazprom to\nadapt prices.  While profit in Russia rose 30 percent to about 200 million\neuros as more generation capacity came online, the shrinking\nreactor fleet and lower power prices in Europe weighed on\nearnings, EON said.  The utility\u2019s net debt stood at 37.6 billion euros at the\nend of the first quarter, about 1.2 billion euros more than at\nthe end of 2011. Full-year underlying net income will be 2.3\nbillion to 2.7 billion euros, EON said.  As  Germany  takes reactors offline, it\u2019s pledged to meet\npower demand with more fossil-fuel-fired plants and alternative\nenergy. EON is raising investments in renewable-power generation\nand is in \u201cpromising talks\u201d with partners in India and Turkey\non opportunities for cooperation, Chief Executive Officer\nJohannes Teyssen said last week.  EON fell 22 cents, or 1.4 percent, to 15.42 euros in\n Frankfurt . The stock has fallen 12 percent this year, valuing\nthe company at 30.9 billion euros.
