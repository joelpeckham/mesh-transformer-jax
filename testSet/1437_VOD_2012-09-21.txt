 "context": "The following article called 'IPhone 5 Limits Set to Spark Samsung Discounts in Europe' was published on 2012-09-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhone 5, which bars customers of some European carriers from accessing the fastest available mobile networks, will prompt those operators to cut prices for handsets from rivals such as  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)   The iPhone 5, which went on sale today, will  connect  to fourth-generation wireless networks in Europe that run on an 1,800 megahertz band, favoring carriers who do have a network attuned to that frequency, including  Germany \u2019s  Deutsche Telekom (DTE)  AG and its British EE venture with  France Telecom SA (FTE) .  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Telefonica SA (TEF) \u2019s O2 unit will only be able to offer the iPhone 5 on their slower 3G networks.  The restrictions of the iPhone 5 will \u201cpush Vodafone and many other European operators harder into the arms of Samsung,\u201d especially as the South Korean company\u2019s popular Galaxy line of phones includes a 4G version that is compatible with their networks, said  Robin Bienenstock , a London-based analyst for Sanford C Bernstein.  With the iPhone 5 predicted by analysts to become the fastest selling technology gadget in history, subsidies and promotions will help operators that only offer the device on slower networks to keep customers. Vodafone lost its top spot in the U.K. to O2 after failing to win the exclusive rights to the first iPhone in 2007. The device became Telefonica\u2019s best-selling phone ever and two-thirds of the clients coming to its U.K. network were poached from rivals.  Upgrade Discount  O2 plans to offer iPhone 5 customers with a long-term contract the chance to upgrade to a 4G phone once the operator\u2019s own 4G service is available, according to Telefonica spokesman Simon Lloyd. The carrier will chip in 10 percent of the cost of buying out the contract and pay the taxes, he said.  The new networks, based on long-term evolution, or LTE, technology, allow users to watch videos, stream music or perform other data-intensive tasks at a faster speed. EE, the largest mobile-phone operator in the U.K., said this week that the new 4G service is five times faster than is currently available.  Samsung vaulted to the top of the global smartphone market by introducing a variety of Galaxy models using  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s Android software. While the iPhone is the most popular smartphone, Android is more widely used, showing up in devices from Samsung to  HTC Corp. (2498)   Galaxy S III  Samsung said this month that sales of its latest Galaxy S III, which has a bigger screen than the iPhone 5 and also works with 4G networks based on different frequencies, topped 20 million units.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  unveiled a lineup of Lumia models this month with the most recent Microsoft Corp. Windows Phone software, aiming to win back market share with better camera and mapping technology.  Customers in Sydney,  Tokyo , Paris and New York lined up for the iPhone 5 today. Queues of more than 1,000 people gathered in  Frankfurt  and London this morning as loyal Apple customers raced to get the latest device. Piper Jaffray Cos analyst  Gene Munster  predicts that 10 million iPhone 5 may be sold this weekend.  Shares of Samsung climbed 1.2 percent to close at 1,302,000 won in  Seoul . In German trading, Apple slipped 0.2 percent to the equivalent of $701.10 as of 10:56 a.m. in Frankfurt. Nokia dropped 0.6 percent to 2.19 euros on the Helsinki exchange.  Subsidy Question  \u201cThe question for operators now becomes in the near term - - how sticky is Apple\u2019s software versus the better speeds of the Samsung Galaxy\u2019s, and how much subsidy will be put behind this,\u201d Bienenstock said.  Vodafone and O2 offer 4G devices from Samsung,  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  and HTC that are able to run on the operator\u2019s 4G networks based on frequencies other than the 1,800 MHz band.  In the U.K., EE said Sept. 11 it will start the service and give pricing details in coming weeks. The U.K. auction of 800 MHz and 2,600 MHz frequencies is set to begin later this year, allowing a general rollout of faster data services in 2013, regulator Ofcom has said.  Vodafone has opposed EE\u2019s move to start 4G services ahead of an upcoming auction of frequencies, saying it was \u201cshocked\u201d by Ofcom\u2019s approval of the service, which creates a \u201ccompetitive distortion.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ll have to work a bit harder and we\u2019ll have to work with other devices,\u201d Vodafone Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford said last week. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at the pricing and competitiveness of those devices.\u201d  To be sure, EE\u2019s LTE network isn\u2019t widely available -- rolling out in 16 British cities by Christmas -- and as the first entrant in the U.K., the burden will fall on them to introduce customers to the new technology and market its benefits, said  Gyanee Dewnarain , a London-based analyst at researcher  Gartner Inc. (IT)   \u201cThey\u2019ll have to do the work to educate the mass market,\u201d Dewnarain said. \u201cThe mass market doesn\u2019t have a clue what LTE is.\u201d By the time they do, Vodafone may be ready to offer its own service, she said.
