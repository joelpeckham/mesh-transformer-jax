 "context": "The following article called 'Connecticut Was Cradle of Gun Culture Centuries Before Massacre' was published on 2012-12-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDean Price thought about keeping the\nshooting range he operates outside Newtown,  Connecticut , closed\nthe day after 20 children and six adults were shot and killed at\nSandy Hook Elementary School.  \u201cWe considered it,\u201d said Price, the 58-year-old head of\nthe Danbury Shooting Sports Association, who has run the range\nin the Wooster Mountain State Park for 19 years. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so\nsure people wanted to hear gunfire today.\u201d  Yet on Dec. 15 the gates on the dirt road to the Wooster\nMountain Shooting Range were open and almost 40 men and women\nwere at the edge of an open field firing handguns and rifles,\naiming at targets hung from frames, as well as bowling pins\nscattered in the dirt at the bottom of an imposing hillside.  While Connecticut has one of the lowest rates of U.S. gun\nownership at less than 20 percent of the population, demand has\nbeen on the upswing since 2007, when burglars invaded a doctor\u2019s\nhome in Cheshire, sexually assaulting and killing his wife and\ntwo daughters, according to Robert Crook, executive director of\n Coalition of Connecticut Sportsmen . The lobbying group, based in\nHartford, estimates that pistol permits have increased to\n170,000 from 145,000 in five years.  Colt\u2019s Home  The state has been central to the firearms industry for\nmore than 200 years, with companies such as  West Hartford \u2019s Colt\nDefense LLC, whose founder, Samuel Colt, invented the revolver\nin 1836. The  National Shooting Sports Federation , a\nmanufacturers group, is even based in Newtown. The federation,\nformed in 1961 and representing more than 3,000 U.S. companies\nand organizations, had two guards in its parking lot Dec. 15\nasking people to leave.  Jake McGuigan, its director of government relations, told\nstate lawmakers last year that the firearms industry has a $1.3\nbillion impact on Connecticut, including 5,400 jobs and $81\nmillion in  tax revenue .  Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR)  of Southport was founded in 1949,\naccording to its website. Today, it produces \u201chundreds of\nthousands of firearms each year for hunting, target shooting,\ncollecting, self-defense,  law enforcement , and government\nagencies,\u201d the website says.  Mossberg & Sons Inc. in North Haven manufactures shotguns\nand rifles. \u201cThe shooting sports have been an American tradition\nfor generations,\u201d the company says on its website.  Legal Bushmaster  Yet the state that makes so many guns also has some of the\nmost restrictive laws in the U.S., including an assault-weapons\nban. Connecticut ranks fifth among states with the strictest gun\nlaws, according to a 2011 scorecard from the Brady Campaign to\nPrevent Gun Violence, a Washington group that claims to be the\ncountry\u2019s largest gun-control lobby.  More than 35 automatic and semi-automatic weapons are\nprohibited. The Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle, which is\nmodeled after the military\u2019s M-16 and was what authorities say\n20-year-old Adam Lanza used at Sandy Hook, isn\u2019t among the\nproscribed guns listed on the state\u2019s  website .  Connecticut residents who aren\u2019t in a police force or the\nmilitary need a hunting license or pistol permit to buy a\nweapon, Crook said in a telephone interview. They need to be 21\nto get a pistol permit, he said.  The state\u2019s industry has beaten back attempts to add\nregulations in the past three years.  \u201cI think the gun owners of Connecticut are more than\nsatisfied with the gun laws as they are now,\u201d Crook said.  Capacious Magazines  Crook said he expects lawmakers to revive legislation to\nlimit the capacity of ammunition magazines to 10 bullets.  Similar proposals set off protests by gun enthusiasts last\nyear after Jared Lee Loughner killed six people in Tuscon,\n Arizona , as he attempted to assassinate former U.S.\nRepresentative  Gabrielle Giffords . In 2009, the industry helped\nkill a bill to force the state\u2019s manufacturers to engrave a\nmicroscopic marking in their weapons to improve traceability.  Authorities are tracing guns found at Lanza\u2019s mother\u2019s home\nand the school, said Ginger Colbrun, spokeswoman for the Bureau\nof Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  Bureau agents pored through records at the Wooster Mountain\nShooting Range after reports that the Lanzas practiced shooting\nnear Newtown, according to Price. He said there are no records\nshowing they ever went there.  \u201cWe have more than enough gun laws,\u201d Price said as shots\nechoed against the mountain outside Newtown. \u201cTheir resources\nwould be better spent on education, on how to prevent someone\nlike that from doing something like that again.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Michael McDonald  in Boston at \n mmcdonald10@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nStephen Merelman at \n smerelman@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. was 33.75368881225586 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. was ",
