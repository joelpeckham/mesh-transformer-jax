 "context": "The following article called 'Lawmakers Ready Budget Fallback Options Amid Tax Impasse' was published on 2013-11-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWith less than three weeks until\ntheir deadline, U.S. budget negotiators have yet to break an\nimpasse over revenue, prompting lawmakers to draft plans to\nblunt $19 billion in defense cuts set to start in January.  One idea -- known as \u201csmoothing\u201d -- would redistribute\nthe 2014 reductions across the 10-year timeframe of the\nautomatic Pentagon cuts known as sequestration. Instead of the\ncuts hitting in January,  defense spending  next year would remain\nat or higher than the current $518 billion level, with greater\nreductions coming in future years.  Budget analysts call the smoothing approach a gimmick, and\nTea Party-aligned lawmakers probably will oppose it.  \u201cIt\u2019s the budget equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs\non the Titanic,\u201d said  Stan Collender , managing director of\nQorvis Communications LLC in Washington and a former\ncongressional appropriations aide.  Still, if Democrats and Republicans on the 29-member budget\npanel can\u2019t bridge the revenue divide, smoothing may serve as an\nalternative for both parties that want to stop cuts the Pentagon\nsays will devastate important military functions. \u201cIt\u2019s either\nthis or nothing,\u201d meaning if this doesn\u2019t work, the deeper\nautomatic cuts will take effect, Collender said.  Aides to Senator  Patty Murray  and Representative  Paul Ryan ,\nthe top Democratic and Republican negotiators on the bipartisan\nbudget panel, say they are inching closer to a tentative deal.\nThey\u2019re identifying savings outside major entitlement programs\nto replace a small portion of the $1.2 trillion in automatic\nspending cuts over a decade, with a Dec. 13 deadline for an\nagreement.  Political Pressure  Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has drawn up options both\nchambers have included in their respective budget resolutions,\nand political pressure is mounting for some deal.  They remain split over whether additional revenue by ending\nsome tax breaks should be a part of an accord. House Speaker\n John Boehner , an  Ohio Republican , has repeatedly ruled out any\ntax increases while Murray says revenue must be included.  Senate Democrats on Nov. 21 moved to end delaying tactics\nknown as filibusters for most executive nominations, leading to\nan escalation in partisan battling. Republicans warned the vote\nwill create an environment that could undermine the work of the\nbudget panel and efforts to reach fiscal deals.  It \u201cfurther complicated a federal budget debate that was\nalready overly complicated and had little chance of success,\u201d\nCollender said. The same day, Boehner said he is making\ncontingency plans in case the budget talks fail, saying the\nHouse will vote on a temporary spending bill keeping the\ngovernment open and the spending caps in place.  Defense Spending  With neither side giving in on taxes, some lawmakers are\nstepping in to address the most immediate fiscal crisis on the\ncalendar: defense cuts.  Senator  John McCain , an  Arizona  Republican, is proposing\nthe \u201csmoothing\u201d approach as an amendment to a defense\nauthorization bill in the Senate.  Jeff Sessions , the top\nRepublican on the Senate Budget Committee, is floating the idea\nto fellow panel members. Senator Angus King of Maine, an\nindependent who caucuses with Democrats, included it in a plan\nhe pitched to committee members.  Leaders of the House and Senate appropriations committees\nhad pressed Murray and Ryan to reach an agreement by Nov. 22 to\nallow time to write legislation needed to fund the government.  Federal Workers  Ryan\u2019s alternatives would target some federal programs,\nsuch as asking federal workers to contribute more to their\npension plans. He also is looking at non-tax revenue, such as\nuser fees for  aviation security  and an annual fee on holders of\nwireless licenses issued by the Federal Communications\nCommission, according to the aides.  Such a deal would account for no more than $50 billion to\n$100 billion, or a year\u2019s worth of cuts under sequestration.  For long-term  deficit reduction , lawmakers would need to\nchange the biggest drivers of the debt,  Social Security ,\nMedicare and Medicaid, which make up almost half of federal\nspending. Many lawmakers are hesitant to trim these programs\nwith a record number of Americans living in poverty and amid\npushback from interest groups including  AARP , the nation\u2019s\nlargest seniors\u2019 lobby with 37 million members.  Republican aides said the chances of a smaller-scale\nagreement hinge on whether Murray drops her demand that so-called loophole closings be part of a deal and instead accepts\nincreased user fees as a form of revenue. Republicans may be\nwilling to offer concessions such as extending  unemployment \nbenefits to reach a deal, they said.  \u2018More Predictability\u2019  The revenue dispute is raising concerns among some\nlawmakers who are already sketching out other options for\ndealing with the defense cuts.  \u201cThe military wants more predictability, they want time,\nand they want more flexibility,\u201d Sessions said in an interview.\n\u201cWe can give them all of those without altering the net\nsequester reductions. You could avoid the cut this year and grow\nat a lesser pace in the future.\u201d  Sequestration led to $80 billion in automatic reductions\nstarting in March to domestic programs, including Head Start for\npoor children and scientific and medical research. An added $19\nbillion cut in Pentagon spending is slated for January.  The panel could trade steeper cuts scheduled for 2014 and\n2015 for greater cuts in future years -- sequestration goes\nthrough 2021 -- or soften its effects by spreading the total of\ncuts over a longer time, into 2022 and 2023, the aides said.  Defense Spending  For instance, McCain\u2019s plan would keep 2014 defense\nspending at $524 billion instead of $498 billion under\nsequestration. Beginning in 2018, the plan would begin cutting\nmore from defense than sequestration does, with the sharpest\nreductions coming in 2020 and 2021. Panel members also could\ngive federal agencies more flexibility in distributing the cuts.  Three years of budget fights have helped drive\ncongressional approval ratings to 9 percent, a 39-year low,\naccording to Gallup Organization polling. Lawmakers now want to\nreconfigure sequestration and avoid another government shutdown\nin mid-January, when Congress must approve federal funding.  Any effort to reapportion the automatic cuts faces a\nroadblock in the Republican-led House, where Tea Party-aligned\nlawmakers want to resist trading concrete spending cuts for\nfuture reductions that future Congresses may reverse.  It also could face opposition in the Democratic-led Senate\nif members view it as a way of watering down the cuts. Senate\nMinority Leader  Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican, warned\n House Republicans  in a closed-door meeting on Nov. 19 against\ntrying to change sequestration\u2019s $967 billion spending cap.  \u2018Bad Idea\u2019  \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea to revisit a law that is actually working\nand reducing spending for the government,\u201d McConnell said later\nthat day. \u201cWe\u2019ve reduced  government spending  for two years in a\nrow for the first time since the  Korean War .\u201d  Another fallback option for easing the defense cuts would\nbe trimming defense entitlements, a politically unpopular path\nthat could include cuts to veterans\u2019 supplemental Medicare\nprogram or require higher co-payments for prescriptions.  Spreading sequestration over a longer period or pushing\ncuts into future years could appeal to some lawmakers.  \u201cWhile I\u2019ve been a vociferous advocate for the big deal\nfor a long time, at this point, to at least take the first\nstep\u201d by reconfiguring the cuts might \u201cmake some sense,\u201d said\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, home to a large\nnumber of defense contractors and federal employees.  Added Flexibility  \u201cAnything we can do to relieve pressure on the Defense\nDepartment through flexibility\u201d or stretching out sequestration\n\u201cwould be acceptable to me,\u201d said South Carolina Senator\nLindsey Graham, a Republican on the panel. \u201cThere would be a\nlot of bipartisan support\u201d for such an approach, he said.  In the first round of cuts, the Army had to cancel training\nfor seven brigade combat teams and deferred maintenance on 172\naircraft, more than 900 vehicles, almost 2,000 weapons, and more\nthan 10,000 pieces of communication equipment.  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the largest U.S. government\ncontractor, will cut 4,000 jobs in response to declining federal\nspending.  The next round will \u201cdirectly affect the purchasing of new\nequipment, funding of research and innovation within the defense\nindustry and put hundreds of thousands of middle-class jobs at\nrisk,\u201d according to a statement from Senator  Richard Durbin  of\nIllinois, the chamber\u2019s second-ranking Democrat.  Rudy Penner, a Congressional Budget Office director from\n1983 to 1987, dismissed the idea of tinkering with the automatic\ncuts timeframe.  \u201cThere are a lot of gimmicks you could use,\u201d said Penner,\nwho warned in 2011 that sequestration was a flawed mechanism\nwith a history of failure. \u201cI frankly was hoping they\u2019d do a\nlittle better than that.\u201d  Such a strategy \u201ccould lead to a continuous cycle in which\nCongress repeatedly avoids making cuts by promising even greater\ncuts in future years,\u201d said  Ed Lorenzen , policy adviser at the\nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
