 "context": "The following article called 'China Seen to Wait Until 2016 to Scrap Cap on Bank Deposit Rates' was published on 2013-09-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina  will probably wait at least\ntwo years before requiring banks to pay market rates on deposits\nas officials seek to avoid disrupting the banking system while\nthe economy is slowing.  Policy makers will remove all restrictions on deposit rates\nin 2016 or later, according to seven of 12 economists and\nanalysts surveyed by Bloomberg News from Sept. 9 to 13. Most\nrespondents said such a move could cut net interest margins, a\nmeasure of loan profitability, by at least 50 basis points and\nsmaller banks will be the hardest hit.  Freeing up the rates will subject the nation\u2019s 3,800 banks\nto greater competition, forcing them to pay savers more to\nretain their share of the country\u2019s 101 trillion yuan ($16.5\ntrillion) in deposits. That will aid Premier  Li Keqiang \u2019s goal\nof promoting  consumer spending  as a driver of the economy, which\nis headed for the slowest growth in 23 years.  \u201cThe key immediate impact would be a shift of income to\nhouseholds from banks,\u201d said Wang Qinwei, a London-based\neconomist at Capital Economics Ltd. That \u201cwill hurt the\nprofitability of the banking sector, but will be critical in\nrebalancing the economy toward consumption.\u201d  Combined profit at  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China\nLtd.  and the other 15  publicly traded banks  on the mainland rose\n13.6 percent in the first half from a year earlier to $101\nbillion, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as the government-set\nrates preserved banks\u2019 lending margins.  The earnings accounted for more than half of the total net\nincome of China\u2019s more than 2,400 listed companies. It also\nexceeds the $82.5 billion earned by 7,000 U.S. banks, Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corp. data show.  Next Step  Respondents were divided on measures that China will take\nbefore embarking on full deposit rate liberalization. As a next\nstep, policy makers will probably allow banks to issue\ncertificates of deposit that offer higher rates for large\namounts of savings, seven respondents said. Four people said the\nsetting up of a deposit insurance system will be next.  Full deregulation of  interest rates  could shrink the\nsector\u2019s average net interest margins by 50 to 100 basis points,\nsix respondents said. Three said the magnitude of the drop will\nbe 10 to 50 basis points and another two predicted a reduction\nof 100 points or more.  The net interest margin at the nation\u2019s 3,800 lenders\nwidened to 2.59 percent in the second quarter from 2.57 percent\nin the first, China Banking Regulatory Commission  data  show.  \u2018Profound Impact\u2019  Meanwhile, Chinese savers are seeing the value of their\nfunds being eroded as deposit rates fail to keep pace with\ninflation. The monetary authority caps returns on deposits at\n1.1 times its benchmark rates. Deposits with a one-year tenure\ncurrently pay 3 percent and savers receive 0.35 percent for\n demand deposits , similar to a checking account, while the\ngovernment\u2019s inflation target for this year is 3.5 percent.  The central bank will allow trading of certificates of\ndeposit between banks in the \u201cnear term\u201d as it creates\nconditions for relaxing control over rates,  Hu Xiaolian , a\nPeople\u2019s Bank of China deputy governor, said in a Sept. 24\nspeech.  China\u2019s central bank has already begun freeing up interest\nrates this year by removing a floor on what banks can charge for\nloans. Revamping deposit rates is the \u201criskiest\u201d part of\nreforms leading toward full interest rate liberalization, and\nwould carry a \u201cmuch more profound impact,\u201d the central bank\n said  July 19, when it allowed banks to freely price loans.  \u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d said  Chris Leung , an economist at\nDBS Bank  Hong Kong  Ltd. and one of five respondents who predict\ninterest rates will be fully driven by market forces before\n2016. \u201cWe do not expect any shocks other than profitability of\nstate banks will dis-inflate over time.\u201d  Be \u2018Unforgivable\u2019  It will be \u201cunforgivable\u201d if policy makers fail to set\ndeposit rates free in five years, Fred Hu, founder of private-equity firm Primavera Capital Group and former Greater China\nchairman at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in an Aug. 15\ninterview in Beijing. China must learn from mistakes in the past\ndecade when it put too much focus on downside risks, leading to\ndelays in reform, Hu said.  Banks may be motivated to pile up riskier assets such as\noff-balance sheet loans when funding costs are no longer\ncontrolled, according to Xu Gao, a Beijing-based economist at\nEverbright Securities Co.  Shadow banking, which includes wealth management products,\nentrusted loans, trusts and underground lending, has raised\nconcerns from regulators that it may destabilize the economy.\nThe sector was valued at $6 trillion by JPMorgan Chase & Co., or\n69 percent of China\u2019s gross domestic product in 2012.  Chasing Yield  \u201cBanks\u2019 asset portfolios will be more skewed to high-yield, low-quality assets in their efforts to search for\nyields,\u201d Xu said. \u201cSmall banks are in a disadvantaged position\nin the competition, so they are more aggressive.\u201d  Ping An Bank Co. and  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988)  are among\nsmaller lenders that expanded loans off their balance sheet last\nyear, increasing the assets more than fivefold, according to\nexchange filings.  With fewer branches to attract savers, small banks have\nrelied on funding from sources such as wealth management\nproducts, which pay higher rates than  bank deposits . They have\noften tapped interbank markets for short-term financing to pay\nredemptions on the wealth products.  In June, the central bank refrained from injecting funds in\nthe  interbank market , leading to the country\u2019s worst cash crunch\nin at least a decade.  The small banks \u201chave been required to self-protect\nthrough the central bank\u2019s stress test,\u201d said Aidan Wang,\nTaipei-based economist at Yuanta Securities Investment\nConsulting Co. Wang also predicts that full interest rate\nderegulation may cut GDP by 0.25 percentage point.  Slower Growth  Gross domestic product in the world\u2019s second-largest\neconomy will probably expand 7.6 percent this year, the slowest\npace in more than two decades, according to the median estimate\nof economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Overcapacity in sectors\nsuch as steel, solar power and shipbuilding has led to slower\ngrowth and rising bad loans.  ICBC led the nation\u2019s biggest state-controlled lenders in\nposting record combined net income of 216 billion  yuan  in the\nfirst half, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier. They\ndefied an earnings slowdown by boosting higher-yield loans to\nsmall firms while stepping up credit-risk management and\nnonperforming loan disposal as well as recovery.  Shares of the five biggest Chinese banks are still trading\nnear record-low valuations on concern that interest rate\nderegulation could increase funding costs and slow the economy,\nleading to more defaults by borrowers.  Before deposit rates can be freed up, banks need to better\nreflect risks when they set lending rates, said Jim Antos, a\nHong Kong-based analyst at  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)   Lenders should downgrade the status of loans \u201cbased on\neconomic reality rather than political considerations,\u201d Antos\nsaid. \u201cThis is a concept they talk about on the mainland but as\nyet do not understand.\u201d  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:\nJun Luo in Shanghai at \n jluo6@bloomberg.net ;\nAipeng Soo in Beijing at \n asoo4@bloomberg.net ;\nStephanie Tong in Hong Kong at \n stong17@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChitra Somayaji at \n csomayaji@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 41.15426254272461 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
