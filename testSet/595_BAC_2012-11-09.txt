 "context": "The following article called 'BofA $1 Billion Whistleblower Also Faced Fraud Claims' was published on 2012-11-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe whistle-blower helping the U.S.\ngovernment mount a $1 billion fraud lawsuit against  Bank of\nAmerica Corp.  was himself accused of fraud by an investor in a\nfinancing company he co-founded, and now works at  Fannie Mae (FNMA) ,\none of two entities he claims the bank defrauded.  Edward O\u2019Donnell sued Bank of America, the second-biggest\nU.S. lender by  assets , in February under the  False Claims Act ,\nsaying the bank\u2019s Countrywide Financial unit, where he once\nworked, issued defective mortgages and sold them to  Fannie Mae \nand  Freddie Mac . Last month, the  Justice Department  joined his\nsuit, making it the first time the U.S. has accused a bank of\nfraud over loans sold to the two government-sponsored mortgage-\nfinance companies.  To make the case, the U.S. may have to confront its\nwhistle-blower\u2019s own tangled history. A year after leaving\nCountrywide, O\u2019Donnell was sued by an investor in a deal\norganized by a commercial financing firm he co-founded. Bank of\nAmerica may use that lawsuit, and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s job at Fannie Mae,\nto raise doubts about his credibility before a jury, according\nto Peter Hutt, a lawyer who defends whistle-blower cases.  \u201cIt could certainly be argued that the whistle-blower had\nan interest in making the allegation either to secure employment\nat Fannie Mae or making himself look good at Fannie Mae,\u201d Hutt,\na partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP in\nWashington, said in a phone interview.  Documentary Evidence  Still, if documents and other evidence support O\u2019Donnell\u2019s\nclaims, \u201cthere won\u2019t be any direct effect\u201d on the U.S. case\nfrom disclosures about his background, said Hutt, who isn\u2019t\ninvolved in the Bank of America lawsuit.  O\u2019Donnell referred a call about the earlier lawsuit to his\nlawyer, David Wasinger, who declined to comment.  Ellen Davis , a\nspokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in  New York , whose\noffice joined the Bank of America case, declined to comment on\nO\u2019Donnell.  The bank has denied the allegations against it in the \nwhistle-blower suit.  \u201cBank of America has stepped up and acted responsibly to\nresolve legacy mortgage matters,\u201d Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman\nfor the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based company, said in a\nstatement after the U.S. joined the case. \u201cBank of America\ncan\u2019t be expected to compensate every entity that claims losses\nthat actually were caused by the economic downturn.\u201d Grayson\ndeclined to comment on the investor claims made against\nO\u2019Donnell.  False Claims  The False Claims Act lets U.S. citizens sue on behalf of\nthe federal government and share in any recovery. Under the law,\nwhich penalizes companies for defrauding the government,\nwhistle-blowers such as O\u2019Donnell may collect as much as\n25 percent of a recovery.  The largest individual recovery ever under the law was\n$96 million for Cheryl Eckard, a former quality assurance\nmanager for GlaxoSmithKline Plc, who was fired after pushing the\ncompany to fix manufacturing flaws at a plant. Bradley Birkenfeld, a former UBS AG banker who told the  Internal Revenue\nService  how the bank helped thousands of Americans evade taxes,\nsecured an award of $104 million under a different statute.  O\u2019Donnell stands to get as much as $250 million if the\ngovernment wins the $1 billion in unreimbursed losses that it\u2019s\nseeking from Bank of America, said David Engstrom, a Stanford\nLaw School professor, who said the amount may also be much less.  The U.S. wins a recovery in 90 percent of the whistle-\nblower cases it elects to join, said Engstrom, who has analyzed\nthousands of such lawsuits filed since 1986. The government\njoins about one-fourth of all False Claims Act cases that have\nbeen unsealed and made public by judges, he said.  \u201cThat\u2019s a very good situation for him,\u201d Engstrom said of\nO\u2019Donnell. \u201cHe\u2019s cleared a major hurdle.\u201d  Risk Management  O\u2019Donnell, who lived in  Texas , worked at Countrywide from\n2003 to 2009, rising to the position of an executive vice\npresident, responsible for risk management of loans, according\nto his complaint. Countrywide, once the largest mortgage lender\nin the U.S., was  acquired  by Bank of America in 2008.  After leaving Countrywide, O\u2019Donnell co-founded Dallas-\nbased Rightway Partners LLC, a commercial financing firm,\naccording to state records and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s ex-business partner,\nMark Dusza. O\u2019Donnell now works at Fannie Mae, according to a\nspokesman for the company.  Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  have operated under U.S.\nconservatorship since 2008, when they were seized amid subprime\nmortgage losses that pushed them toward insolvency.  \u2018Private Citizen\u2019  \u201cMr. O\u2019Donnell filed this action as a private citizen,\u201d\n Andrew Wilson , the spokesman for Washington-based Fannie Mae,\nsaid in an e-mailed statement. \u201cIt alleges facts relating to\nhis professional experience prior to working at Fannie Mae.\nFannie Mae was not involved in any way with the filing of Mr.\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s complaint.\u201d  Wilson said O\u2019Donnell \u201cdoes not work on any matters that\nare the subject of the complaint.\u201d  In the complaint, which was filed under seal in  Manhattan \nfederal court and unsealed Oct. 24, O\u2019Donnell accused\nCountrywide and Bank of America of trying to increase volume by\nignoring quality-control guidelines and underwriting loans that\nsoon defaulted. The loans were sold to Fannie Mae and McLean,\nVirginia-based Freddie Mac, which buy single-family mortgages to\nprovide market liquidity.  O\u2019Donnell\u2019s \u201cconcerns were disregarded and Countrywide\ncontinued to ignore underwriting and quality control,\u201d\naccording to the complaint. \u201cBillions of dollars of poor\nquality loans continued to be originated and sold\u201d to Fannie\nMae and Freddie Mac, O\u2019Donnell said.  The Hustle  The government intervened in the case on Oct. 24. In its\ncomplaint, the U.S. said O\u2019Donnell warned the bank that a\nstrategy for underwriting called the Hustle -- short for its\n\u201chigh-speed swim lane\u201d model of loan origination --\n\u201cpresented a disastrous layering of risk\u201d by eliminating\nunderwriter review of most applications and letting unqualified\nemployees determine whether to make loans.  \u201cConcerned about the high defect rates from the pilot of\nthe Hustle and a rapid deterioration in loan quality, O\u2019Donnell\ndirected some of the underwriters to conduct quality checks on\nthe Hustle loans pre-funding, in the hope that the defects could\nbe corrected,\u201d the Justice Department said. From 2007 to 2009,\nCountrywide hid from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the \u201calarming\nspike in defect rates\u201d in loan defaults, according to the\ncomplaint.  Fourteen months before O\u2019Donnell accused Countrywide of\nrunning a scheme that cost the U.S. billions of dollars, he was\naccused of fraud by an investor in a deal sponsored by Rightway\nPartners.  \u2018Four Guys\u2019  Rightway was formed in 2009 by O\u2019Donnell, an  Arizona  man\nnamed Patrick McMullan, Dusza and one other person, according to\nDusza. The firm sought to obtain financing for companies seeking\nto expand, he said.  \u201cWe were just four guys who knew each other,\u201d said Dusza,\nwho said he worked and socialized with O\u2019Donnell while at\nCountrywide and then joined him at Rightway. He called O\u2019Donnell\n\u201ca very upstanding guy.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s always been a do-the-right-thing guy. Very respected\nin the industry, always been very honest,\u201d Dusza said.  Rightway was unable to find financing for a single client,\nhe said.  \u201cWe had no money pass through the company,\u201d said Dusza,\nciting the harsh lending climate in 2009 and 2010. \u201cWe were\nreaching out to people who were advertising deals on the\nInternet.\u201d Dusza said he spent about a year at the firm.  Still, Rightway tried to broker at least one deal,\naccording to court papers.  \u2018Origination Fee\u2019  In early 2010, O\u2019Donnell and McMullan allegedly told three\ninvestors they could double their money in \u201ca matter of days\u201d\nby placing a total of $575,000 with Rightway, according to\nlawsuits the investors later filed. The $575,000 would act as an\n\u201corigination fee\u201d securing a $100 million loan to Rightway\nfrom one or more banks, the investors said they were told,\naccording to court filings.  O\u2019Donnell, McMullan and  David Rosenberg , a  Connecticut \nlawyer, allegedly said the \u201carrangement was safe and secure and\na proven financial process,\u201d investors James VinZant and  David\nMartin  said in their lawsuit against Rightway. Thomas Madison, a\nthird Rightway investor, sued the firm, O\u2019Donnell, McMullan and\nRosenberg over the same deal.  The three said they lost their money and claimed Rightway\ndidn\u2019t use their investments as promised, didn\u2019t contribute at\nleast $200,000 that it pledged toward the origination fee and\ndeceived the investors when McMullan and O\u2019Donnell said the\ninvestment was safe.  \u2018Repeated Statements\u2019  \u201cMr. O\u2019Donnell repeated statements to the effect that\nRightway\u2019s interests in making sure this deal closed was the\nsame as mine as they had funds at risk, just as I did,\u201d Madison\nsaid in an affidavit attached to the complaint he filed in\nfederal court in  New Haven , Connecticut, in December 2010.  The investors also claimed that Rightway hid that the\nNevada-based company that was supposed to secure the\n$100 million loan on Rightway\u2019s behalf had been accused of fraud\nin 2009, along with its two officers. A federal judge in Las\nVegas last month entered a summary judgment against the two\nofficers.  Madison\u2019s suit against Rightway was settled confidentially\nthis year after a judge in Connecticut refused Rosenberg\u2019s\ndismissal bid. The VinZant suit is pending. McMullan didn\u2019t\nreturn telephone calls.  No Loan  Mark Johnson , a lawyer for O\u2019Donnell, McMullan and\nRightway, said his clients denied wrongdoing. Rosenberg, the\nConnecticut lawyer, said in a phone interview that the\n$100 million loan \u201cdid not materialize\u201d after\n\u201crepresentations O\u2019Donnell and McMullan made.\u201d  These details about O\u2019Donnell\u2019s background may never be\naired before a jury in the whistle-blower lawsuit.  It\u2019s \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d for False Claims Act cases to\nreach trial, said Engstrom. Because the U.S. has probably\namassed documents and other evidence to support the claims,\ndetails of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s background may be no more than\n\u201catmospherics\u201d that don\u2019t affect the outcome, he said.  Engstrom predicted the government might join other mortgage\ncases. That it took the Justice Department eight months to\ndecide to join O\u2019Donnell\u2019s lawsuit -- compared with an average\nof 24 months in other whistle-blower cases -- indicates that the\nU.S. is taking such allegations seriously, he said.  \u201cIt certainly suggests to me that this is part of a\nbroader strategic decision by DOJ to intervene in this space,\u201d\nhe said.  The government\u2019s case is U.S. v.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,\nU.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).\nO\u2019Donnell\u2019s suit is U.S. ex rel. Edward O\u2019Donnell v. Bank of\nAmerica, 12-cv-1433, U.S. District Court, Southern District of\nNew York (Manhattan). The investor cases are Madison v. Rightway\nPartners, 10-cv-1912; and VinZant v. Rightway Partners, 12-cv-\n472, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut (New Haven).
