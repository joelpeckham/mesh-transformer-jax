 "context": "The following article called 'Health Spending Grows at Half Pre-Recession Level in 2011' was published on 2013-01-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHealth-care spending in the U.S. grew\nat less than half the pre-recession level for the third straight\nyear, as employers shifted more costs to strapped workers and\nstate governments limited payouts for the poor.  Spending on hospital visits, medications and other care\ngrew 3.9 percent to $2.7 trillion in 2011, matching the slowest\ngrowth in 52 years of record keeping, the  Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services  said in a report yesterday in the journal\nHealth Affairs. Growth was close to 8 percent before the U.S.\nentered an 18-month recession in December 2007.  Joseph Antos , who researches the economics of health policy\nat the Washington-based  American Enterprise Institute , said\nchanges in employer-sponsored insurance coverage has been a key\nfactor in putting a damper on health-care costs.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a slow down for a considerable amount of time\nand I think that is much more related to employer coverage\ntightening up than anything else,\u201d Antos said by telephone.\nEmployers are offering plans that have more cost sharing and\nhigher deductibles, which result in lower premiums, he said.  A shift in government expenditures also has contributed as\nstates cut provider reimbursements and restricted eligibility\nfor Medicaid, the roughly $450 billion federal and state health\nprogram for the poor. Spending there rose 2.5 percent in 2011,\nless than half the rate of 2010, according to the report.  State Decisions  \u201cPart of the slowing is due to policy decisions in states\nintended to slow growth,\u201d said Thomas Johnson, president and\nchief executive officer of Medicaid Health Plans of America,\nwhich lobbies for insurers such as  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)   So far, the effect of the 2010 Affordable Care Act on\nmedical spending has been \u201cminimal,\u201d according to the report.\nThat may change next year, when much of the insurance expansion\ncreated by the health-care system overhaul begins to take\neffect. The Obama administration projected in June that health\nspending would rise 7.4 percent in 2014.  Total U.S. health-care expenditures, which account for\nabout 18 percent of gross domestic product, will surpass $3\ntrillion in 2014 and reach $4.8 trillion in 2021, according to\nadministration forecasts.  Private Enrollment  The health law has ushered in some changes. Private health-\ninsurance enrollment, which had fallen by 11.2 million from 2007\nto 2010, increased by a net 1 million people last year,\naccording to the report. That was related to 2.7 million\ncustomers added largely because of provisions in the health law\nthat let young adults as old as age 26 sign on to their parents\nhealth plans, according to the economists\u2019 analysis.  At the same time, spending on Medicare, the federal health\nprogram for the elderly and disabled, grew at a faster pace\ncompared to 2010.  Premiums for private plans increased 3.8 percent, up from\n3.4 percent in 2010, the analysis shows, which is based on\ngovernment data first released in June.  Out-of-pocket spending by consumers rose 2.8 percent in\n2011, compared with 2.1 percent in 2010, according to the CMS\neconomists\u2019 report. The increase was fueled by hospital and\ndental services and partially offset by a decline in spending on\n prescription drugs .
