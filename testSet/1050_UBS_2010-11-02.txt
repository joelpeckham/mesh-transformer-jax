 "context": "The following article called 'Dimon Beset by Bad Loans as JPMorgan Pushes Overseas' was published on 2010-11-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJamie Dimon  wanted  Washington Mutual\nInc . and he wanted it bad.  The JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer was\ndetermined to expand on the West Coast, and Seattle-based WaMu,\nas it was called, was a prime target. Dimon had a team of\nauditors poring over WaMu\u2019s books in March 2008, at the same\nmoment the Treasury Department was pressing him to acquire\nstruggling investment bank Bear Stearns Cos.  While he initially couldn\u2019t make a deal for the Seattle\nlender, JPMorgan did buy WaMu in September 2008 after it was\nseized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which meant the\nassets came at a bargain price of $1.9 billion, Bloomberg\nMarkets magazine reports in its December issue.  The 2,200 WaMu branches in  California ,  Washington  and 12\nother states gave JPMorgan\u2019s consumer bank, Chase, a total of\n5,410 branches -- the second-biggest network in the nation. And\nit moved Chase to first from third in deposits, with $905\nbillion after the deal closed.  Dimon, 54, got what he wanted -- and a lot that he didn\u2019t\nwant. JPMorgan is now saddled with $74.8 billion in\nnonperforming home loans inherited from WaMu, a third of the\n$230.7 billion in mortgages on its books.  The WaMu losses are just one of the afflictions besetting\nthe man who, in the midst of the recession two years ago, was\ndubbed the world\u2019s most powerful financial executive by the  New\nYork  Times and labeled President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cfavorite\nbanker.\u201d  King Jamie  New York magazine called him \u201c Good King Jamie ,\u201d while a\nbiography of Dimon by author Duff McDonald is entitled Last Man\nStanding (Simon & Schuster, 2009).  Back in 2008, Douglas Ciocca, managing director of St.\nLouis-based asset manager Renaissance Financial Corp., compared\nDimon with J. Pierpont Morgan himself, who helped rescue the\nfinancial system in the crash of 1907.  \u201cHe\u2019s been a voice of reason throughout the industry\npretty much throughout the financial crisis,\u201d Ciocca said.  A lot has gone wrong for Dimon since those halcyon days.\nBoth the WaMu mortgages and JPMorgan\u2019s own home-equity loans are\nspilling red ink. Dimon\u2019s commodities-trading team, led by\nBlythe Masters, has suffered a big setback. Dimon complains that\nhundreds of millions of dollars in profits will be lost to the\nObama administration\u2019s new financial regulations, which he\nfought unsuccessfully to derail.  Basel Costs  Still more potential profits will be lost to the new Basel\nrules, which will increase capital requirements for banks\nworldwide beginning in 2013. The  Basel Committee on Banking\nSupervision  pushed back the date the capital rules would take\neffect because of the fragility of most of the big banks in the\nU.S. and Europe.  In consumer banking -- JPMorgan\u2019s biggest revenue source --\nthe bank is pushing against a regulation limiting it to 10\npercent of national deposits. With more than $2 trillion in\ntotal assets, JPMorgan is now the second-biggest U.S. financial\ninstitution by assets, after  Bank of America Corp .  It\u2019s the biggest U.S. credit card company, with $137.4\nbillion in outstanding loans, followed by Bank of America and  Citigroup Inc .  The latest bad news is that the Securities and Exchange\nCommission is investigating whether JPMorgan failed to tell\ninvestors that an Evanston, Illinois-based hedge fund called\nMagnetar Capital helped select subprime mortgages for a\ncollateralized debt obligation, or CDO, that the bank created, a\nperson familiar with the matter said yesterday.  \u2018Cooperating Fully\u2019  Magnetar later bet against the security, the person said.\nJPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said the company, \u201clike\nother firms, has received inquiries from the SEC related to\ncollateralized debt obligations. We are cooperating fully with\nthese inquiries.\u201d  The bank\u2019s shares dropped as much as 1.4 percent after the\ninvestigative Web site ProPublica disclosed the probe yesterday,\nclosing down 21 cents, at $37.42. They fell 46 cents or 1.2\npercent more today to a close of $36.96.  Dimon has ambitious plans for overseas expansion, yet is\nhemmed in by banks with big international franchises, especially\nin the so-called BRICs:  Brazil , Russia,  India  and  China . Just a\nquarter of JPMorgan\u2019s total revenue comes from outside the U.S.,\ncompared with more than half for Citigroup, says Anthony Polini,\nan analyst at investment bank Raymond James Financial Inc.\nInternational business, however, accounted for 61.6 percent of\nJPMorgan\u2019s net income in 2009.  Overseas Expansion  Dimon is likely to expand overseas through acquisitions,\nPolini says -- the New York banker\u2019s approach since he linked up\nright out of Harvard Business School in 1982 with Sanford Weill\nand helped Weill build the financial conglomerate that became\nCitigroup.  Yet Dimon has made only one major acquisition since WaMu.\nHe\u2019s been too busy putting out fires. In addition to the WaMu\nlosses, Dimon has to deal with $113 billion in risky subprime,\nhome-equity and adjustable-rate loans that JPMorgan originated.  In October, the bank halted foreclosures on thousands of\nhomes when lawyers for homeowners said that JPMorgan, Bank of\nAmerica, Ally Financial Inc. and other big banks had been\n\u201crobo-signing\u201d foreclosure documents without verifying their\naccuracy. JPMorgan temporarily stopped foreclosures in the 23\nstates where they are processed through the courts, later\nexpanding the number to 41.  Bank of America, the nation\u2019s biggest mortgage holder,\nstopped selling off homes in all 50 states before reversing\ncourse.  Regulation Blues  Meanwhile, Dimon\u2019s standing in Washington has declined\nsince he lobbied against parts of Obama\u2019s financial regulation\nlaw, which imposes new capital requirements on banks, forbids\nproprietary trading and imposes new regulations on the trading\nof derivatives, of which JPMorgan is the U.S.\u2019s biggest dealer.  Dimon wasn\u2019t included in the photo op when the bill was\nsigned, and he was absent from a May White House state dinner\nattended by  American Express Co . CEO Kenneth I. Chenault,  Morgan\nStanley \u2019s James Gorman and Bank of America\u2019s Brian T. Moynihan,\namong other Wall Street leaders.  When a shareholder asked Dimon during JPMorgan\u2019s annual\nmeeting in May whether he was still Obama\u2019s favorite banker, he\nreplied, \u201cI heard he has a new one.\u201d  Dimon, a Queens, New York, native, is well-known for his\nrefusal to mince words. When he dresses down subordinates,\npoliticians or the media, he uses profanity liberally, according\nto people who have heard him. In June, students at  Syracuse\nUniversity  protested when he was invited to give the school\u2019s\ncommencement address.  Lap Dogs and Sycophants  He went ahead with the speech and congratulated them for\nspeaking their minds.  \u201cThroughout my life and throughout this crisis, I\u2019ve seen\nmany people embarrass themselves by failing to stand up, being\nmealy-mouthed and acting like lemmings by simply going along\nwith the pack,\u201d he told the graduates. \u201cAlong the way, you\u2019re\ngoing to face a lot of pressure -- pressure to go along, to get\nalong, to toe the line. Have the fortitude to do the right\nthing, not the easy thing. Don\u2019t be somebody\u2019s lap dog or\nsycophant.\u201d  JPMorgan declined to make Dimon available for this story.  Dimon anticipated that his crown was likely to be knocked\naskew. In 2009, he told attendees at a meeting, \u201cI know exactly\nwhat the headline will say when I make a mistake: \u2018Dimon Loses\nLuster,\u2019\u201d according to two people who heard the comments.  Best Big Bank  Yet Dimon\u2019s bank is still the brightest star in a dim\nfirmament. While JPMorgan\u2019s stock lost 14.4 percent in the three\nyears through today, investors did far worse buying the shares\nof its competitors. Citigroup shares were down 89 percent in the\nsame three years, while Bank of America\u2019s return was minus 74.7\npercent and Wells Fargo & Co.\u2019s stock fell 19.6 percent.  \u201cRevenue headwinds such as slow loan growth, slim profit\nmargins and higher regulatory costs should continue to hammer\nbank revenue not only next year but for the decade,\u201d says Mike Mayo, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities USA Inc. in New\nYork. \u201cWe think 2011 will be indicative of a year in a decade\nfor banks that has the worst revenue growth since the\nDepression.\u201d  The debacle in the housing market is still the biggest\nheadache for U.S. banks. Payments on some 8 million U.S.\nmortgages were delinquent in late September, and almost 7\nmillion of those may end up in foreclosure, says  Laurie Goodman ,\na senior managing director at Austin, Texas-based Amherst\nSecurities Group LP.  11.5 Million Seizures  Those projections exclude the 200,000 additional borrowers\nthat become delinquent each month for the first time, she says.  In total, Goodman estimates that 11.5 million homes could\nbe repossessed by banks during the next five years.  Profits are also being squeezed by the Federal Reserve\u2019s\npolicy of keeping  interest rates  persistently low, which had\nhelped boost bank earnings during the worst of the credit\ncrisis, says Matthew O\u2019Connor, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in\nNew York. The Fed\u2019s near-zero target rate for interbank\novernight lending is compressing banks\u2019 net interest margins,\nthe difference between what they pay to borrow money and what\nthey get for loans and securities.  \u201cIt\u2019s a massive issue,\u201d O\u2019Connor says. \u201cAs you look out\nover the next few quarters, it\u2019s a potentially very dire\nsituation for the overall industry.\u201d  JPMorgan\u2019s results for the third quarter confirmed\nO\u2019Connor\u2019s pessimism. Margins fell by 31 basis points to 3.01\npercent at JPMorgan from March 31 to Sept. 30. (A basis point is\n0.01 percentage point.) Combined with lower lending volumes, the\nreduced margins translated to a decrease in net interest income\nof $1.2 billion.  Revenue Drops  While third-quarter profit rose 23 percent from 2009 to\n$4.42 billion, the company generated 11 percent less revenue, at\n$23.8 billion. The profit included $1.5 billion the bank took\nout of its reserves against bad credit card loans.  \u201cInvestors are still trying to figure out where revenue is\ngoing to come from when they stop being able to release\nreserves,\u201d says Jason Tyler, a senior vice president at Ariel\nInvestments LLC in  Chicago . \u201cThat\u2019s not clear yet.\u201d  There may be more bad news hidden in JPMorgan\u2019s books. The\nbank set aside $30 billion against bad WaMu loans when it\nacquired the thrift in 2008. Dimon predicted that number could\nrise by $24 billion if unemployment hit 8 percent.  Unemployment was 9.6 percent in October, yet JPMorgan had\nonly upped its reserves by an additional $3 billion.  \u201cWaMu was a top-to-bottom subprime lender,\u201d says  Paul Miller , a bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in\nArlington, Virginia. And its branch network outside California\nis not worth much, he says. \u201cThey were very expensive branches,\nnot well placed.\u201d  \u2018Performing Better\u2019  The company told analysts last month that the WaMu mortgage\nportfolio could cost $3 billion more if losses continued at\ncurrent rates. \u201cThe portfolio is performing better than\nexpected in this type of environment,\u201d says  Joe Evangelisti , a\nJPMorgan spokesman.  Dimon says he doesn\u2019t expect profits to be dented much by\nthe foreclosure scandal.  \u201cIt will cost us some money to go back and make sure it\u2019s\ndone right,\u201d he told analysts on the Oct. 13 earnings\nconference call. \u201cIt will delay some foreclosures. But the\nwhole mortgage issue costs us so much money now, to me it will\nbe incremental.\u201d  He said that no one had been evicted who shouldn\u2019t have\nbeen. JPMorgan is the third-largest mortgage servicer in the\nU.S., with 13 percent of the market as of June 30, according to\nindustry newsletter  Inside Mortgage Finance .  50-State Probe  On the same day Dimon made his statement, attorneys general\nin all 50 states announced a joint investigation into whether\nbanks and loan servicers used false documents and signatures to\nforeclose on hundreds of thousands of homeowners.  In September, lawyers for defaulting borrowers disclosed\nthat a mortgage executive at Chase Home Finance in Florida said\nin a May 17 deposition that she was among eight managers who\ntogether signed about 18,000 affidavits a month attesting to\nfacts in foreclosure cases without personally checking loan\nrecords.  JPMorgan said on Oct. 13 that it was reviewing the\ndocuments for 115,000 loans. Nancy Bush, an analyst at\nAnnandale, New Jersey-based NAB Research LLC, says JPMorgan\ncan\u2019t rid itself of the foreclosure mess so easily.  \u201cDimon was putting a happy face on this issue,\u201d she says.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll review 115,000 foreclosures now in process. But what\nabout the rest that have already occurred?\u201d  \u2018Long-Term Problem\u2019  Brian Battle, vice president of trading at Performance\nTrust Capital Partners LLC in Chicago, says the bank\u2019s\nforeclosure flaws are just becoming apparent.  \u201cThat can be a big long-term problem, very expensive,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cThe whole can of worms is wide open.\u201d  Even as Dimon swims through a sea of trouble, he can brag\nthat JPMorgan remains the strongest big bank in the nation. It\u2019s\nthe only major bank to have turned a profit in every quarter\nsince the crisis erupted in late 2007. Per-share earnings have\ngrown 14-fold since hitting a six-year low of 7 cents in the\nfourth quarter of 2008. They were $1.01 in the third quarter.  The bank has generated $29.9 billion in net income since\ntaking over Bears Stearns in March 2008 -- an acquisition that\nhas been a huge boon to JPMorgan\u2019s investment banking franchise.  When JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns and WaMu, Dimon \u201chad\nthe strongest balance sheet in the industry,\u201d says Robert Willumstad, a former Citigroup chief operating officer who has\nknown Dimon since they both worked at Baltimore-based Commercial\nCredit Co. in the 1980s. \u201cThat\u2019s the exact position you want to\nbe in: You want to be the strongest player in the marketplace\nwhen the government turns to you and says: \u2018We\u2019ve got a problem.\nCan you take it off our hands?\u2019\u201d  Efficient Integrator  Dimon\u2019s surpassing skill is his ability to hold down costs,\nefficiently integrate new acquisitions and minimize risk,\nWillumstad says. During his four years as CEO of Chicago-based\nBank One Corp., from 2000 to 2004, Dimon engineered a dramatic\nturnaround that took the bank from a $511 million loss in 2000\nto a $3.5 billion profit in 2003.  When Bank One merged with JPMorgan in 2004 in a $58 billion\ndeal, CEO William Harrison named Dimon president and chief\noperating officer. Dimon overhauled management, shuttered\nlagging businesses and instituted monthly management reviews in\nlocal branches.  Dimon was named JPMorgan CEO on Dec. 31, 2005. He largely\navoided investing in the subprime housing loans that crippled\nBear Stearns and Merrill Lynch & Co. -- at least until he bought\nWaMu. Since 2006, JPMorgan has generated $59.7 billion in profit\nat a compounded annual growth rate of 22 percent.  Fees Double  Investment-banking fees, including those from trading and\nextending credit lines to clients, were $20 billion during the\nfirst nine months of 2010, up from $9.4 billion for the same\nperiod in 2004.  Dimon honed his cost-cutting skills while managing the\nserial acquisitions that he and Weill used to build Citigroup.\nThe two men worked together for 16 years, starting at American\nExpress. The list of institutions Weill and Dimon then took\ncontrol of reads like a history of modern finance: Travelers\nGroup Inc., Shearson, Smith Barney, Salomon Brothers, Citicorp\nand Primerica, to name the largest.  By the time Dimon was fired from Citigroup in November 1998\nby Weill and his co-CEO John Reed, Dimon and Weill had created a\nbanking, trading and insurance behemoth of unprecedented size\nand scope.  No Fools Invited  In his various jobs under Weill, \u201cDimon didn\u2019t suffer\nfools,\u201d says former Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. CEO Frank Zarb,\nnow chairman of consulting firm Promontory Financial Group LLC\nin Washington. Zarb, 75, met Dimon in 1987 at Commercial Credit,\nand they have remained close ever since. \u201cHe was young but\nstruck me as really smart and he called them like he saw them,\u201d\nZarb says. Some called the young banker brash, Zarb adds. \u201cI\ncall it intellectually honest,\u201d he says.  At JPMorgan, Dimon hasn\u2019t deviated from the management\npractices that have brought him this far. JPMorgan\u2019s acquisition\nof Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest U.S. securities firm at the\ntime, has gone far smoother than that of WaMu.  The bank ended up paying roughly $1.5 billion in stock to\nclose the deal. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York agreed to\ntake $30 billion of the struggling investment bank\u2019s mortgage-\nbacked securities, collateralized debt obligations and other\nilliquid assets. JPMorgan assumed the first $1 billion in\nlosses.  JPMorgan got billions of dollars in new investment-banking\nrevenue and a prime-brokerage business serving hedge-fund\nclients out of the deal. The acquisition boosted 2008 second-\nquarter profits by $500 million.  Faltering Economy  JPMorgan\u2019s investment bank carried the bank\u2019s earnings\nthrough 2008 and 2009. Fees and trading revenue began to falter\nin 2010 due to the persistently weak economy and high\nunemployment.  Dimon\u2019s commodities division, run by Masters, was rocked in\nthe second quarter by an undisclosed loss in its coal\ninvestments, when trader Chan Bhima took a position in the fuel\njust before prices plunged. Masters sought to reassure her team\nin an internal conference call on July 22, after what she called\n\u201cextremely difficult\u201d dismissals, defections and a 2010 first\nhalf in which some results were as much as 20 percent below\nexpectations.  \u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d Masters said in the 35-minute call, a\nrecording of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. \u201cNo one\u2019s\ngoing to get screwed. We\u2019re not going to do crazy things on\ncompensation at the end of the year.\u201d  Commodities Firings  The company let go about 10 percent of the commodities\nfront-office staff in the third quarter. JPMorgan also shuttered\nits commodities proprietary trading desk, affecting roughly 20\ntraders, most of them in  London . They had to reapply for jobs\nelsewhere in the company.  The company said it cut the desk to comply with the Dodd-\nFrank law, which limits banks\u2019 ability to trade for their own\naccount. Other proprietary traders are being moved to JPMorgan\u2019s\nasset management division, where they will trade for clients.  Dimon doesn\u2019t want to hear excuses for his executives\u2019\nfailures. He has a sign in his office in big bold type that\nreads \u201cNo Whiners.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a looking-forward mentality: Don\u2019t whine about it;\njust get it done,\u201d says Ron Seiffert, whom Dimon hired from\nHuntington Bancshares Inc. to run Bank One\u2019s small-business\nlending in 2002.  Seiffert is now vice president of  Ohio Dominican\nUniversity .  Doubling Down  Seiffert says Dimon displayed his philosophy when United\nAirlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2002,\nafter being weakened by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Bank One was\none of the airline\u2019s biggest creditors. Instead of scaling back\nhis exposure, Dimon decided to extend even more credit to the\nairline.  It was a risky bet that eventually paid off, Seiffert says.\n\u201cHe said: \u2018We made this decision. If we made the wrong\ndecision, I\u2019ll go home, I\u2019ll have a couple of martinis, I\u2019ll\nwake up the next day and we\u2019ll come back,\u2019\u201d Seiffert says.  Dimon doesn\u2019t always play the role of F-word-slinging tough\nguy. Executives, including junior managers, whose work catches\nhis attention might get invited to sip wine in his office after\nmarkets close on Friday afternoon, current and former employees\nsay. It\u2019s a tradition begun under Weill, when Dimon was his\nchief of staff at American Express.  Executive Shakeups  Dimon has been both the victim and author of executive\nsuite shakeups. After Harrison left the bank in 2006, Dimon\nreplaced many of his top staff with former colleagues from Bank\nOne and Citigroup. The most recent executive shuffle took place\nin September 2009, when Bill Winters, now 48, a co-CEO of\nJPMorgan\u2019s investment bank, was fired and Dimon named James\n\u201cJes\u201d Staley CEO of the unit.  Steven Black, the other investment bank co-CEO, was moved\nup to vice chairman; he has no operational departments reporting\nto him, people familiar with the matter say. Black and Winters\ndeclined to comment for this story.  Staley, 53, joined JPMorgan in 1979. He started out in\ninvestment banking on the Brazil desk, later running JPMorgan\u2019s\nequity and capital markets group as well as its asset management\ndivision.  Dimon\u2019s brain trust -- the people he gathers around him in\ntimes of crisis -- are a mix of new and old bankers, people\nfamiliar with his decision making say. Dimon said in March that\nhe planned to rotate senior executives with an eye toward\npicking a successor. He\u2019s been grooming a handful of long-time\nloyalists for the spot for years.  Brain Trust  Among them, besides Staley, are Heidi Miller, who was\npromoted in June to head of international operations after\nhaving started as Dimon\u2019s assistant at Travelers Group in 1992;\nCharlie Scharf, head of retail services, who first worked with\nDimon at Commercial Credit; Mike Cavanagh, head of treasury and\nsecurity services, who was hired by Dimon at Salomon Smith\nBarney in 1993 and then again at Bank One in 2000; and Jay Mandelbaum, whom Dimon hired away from consulting firm McKinsey\n& Co. in the mid-1990s and who now runs JPMorgan\u2019s strategy and\nbusiness development division.  Dimon has also grown close to Stephen Cutler, the\nenforcement chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nunder President George W. Bush who joined JPMorgan as general\ncounsel in 2007.  One of the inner circle\u2019s challenges is to deal with the\nraft of financial regulations passed by the Obama administration\nin July. Dimon told investors on Sept. 14 that the bank will\nlose about $750 million in profits just as a result of new\nrestrictions on the fees and interest it can charge on credit\ncards.  Derivatives Hit  \u201cNo bank has more to lose with the new financial service\nrules than JPMorgan,\u201d says Joshua Rosner, a bank analyst at\nindependent research firm Graham Fisher & Co. in New York.  JPMorgan is especially vulnerable because it\u2019s the U.S.\u2019s\nbiggest creator and trader of derivatives, securities whose\nvalue is derived from the price of stocks, bonds or commodities,\nRosner says. The notional value of the bank\u2019s outstanding\nderivatives contracts -- that is, the value of the securities\nunderlying them -- was  $75.6 trillion as of June 30 , according\nto the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  A JPMorgan team led by Masters was among the first sellers\nof the most controversial form of derivative, the credit-default\nswap, which provides insurance against a security\u2019s default.  $1 Billion Lost  The Dodd-Frank Act requires banks to move derivatives\ntrading to separately capitalized subsidiaries, which Dimon is\nin the process of doing at what he says is a cost of $1 billion\nin lost revenue. Standard derivatives must be traded on\nexchanges, rather than over the counter.  \u201cIt\u2019s an operational nightmare,\u201d Dimon said on a July\nconference call with analysts, of the bill\u2019s restrictions on\nderivatives trading. \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s highly ill-conceived,\ndoesn\u2019t reduce risk at all.\u201d  Dimon says he is looking for ways to pass on all of the\nextra regulatory costs to consumers and corporate clients. Fewer\nborrowers will get loans and credit cards, he says. He estimates\nthat the passing on of costs will reduce the bank\u2019s retail\ncustomer base by about 5 percent.  \u201cWe are going to earn it all back, whatever the number\nis,\u201d Dimon told investors at a Sept. 14 conference hosted by\nBarclays Capital in New York.  The bank hopes to replace some of its lost profits by\nexpanding overseas, particularly in the booming BRIC countries.  Throwing BRICs  \u201cThese emerging markets, primarily in Latin America and  Asia , offer much better economic prospects than the U.S. or\nWestern  Europe ,\u201d Raymond James\u2019s Polini says. \u201cJPMorgan is\nramping up to go head-to-head with Citigroup.\u201d  Miller says JPMorgan needs to expand internationally\nbecause that\u2019s where its corporate customers are.  \u201cMultinationals operate in sometimes more countries than\nwe do,\u201d Miller said at the time she took her new job. \u201cWe\nincreasingly see our clients look to us to provide services and\nsolutions throughout the world. We want to make sure we can do\nit for them seamlessly.\u201d  Investment bank head Staley laid out ambitious plans in\nFebruary to double the bank\u2019s market share in Asia in the next\nfew years. U.S. banks, however, could have a difficult time\nwidening their footprint there, Peter Sands, CEO of London-based\nStandard Chartered Plc, told Bloomberg News in October.  Global Blockade  Standard Chartered gets 90 percent of its revenue from\nAsia, Africa and the Middle East, and he says both international\nbanks like his and local competitors could block new foreign\nintrusions.  \u201cThe best of the competition probably comes from the best\nof the local banks in most of our markets rather than from the\ninternational class,\u201d he says.  One sector where JPMorgan already has global stature is\ncommodities. Under Masters, JPMorgan has acquired a half dozen\ninternational concerns, including UBS AG\u2019s global agriculture\nand Canadian commodities divisions in 2009. Buying Bear Stearns\ngave the bank a business trading natural gas, coal and weather\ncontracts.  Last year, the company completed a $1.7 billion deal to buy\nparts of commodities trader RBS Sempra, a joint venture between\nRoyal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Sempra Energy. And in March\n2008, the bank made itself a big player in European carbon\ntrading when it bought Oxford, England-based ClimateCare, which\nsponsors projects that help reduce carbon emissions.  Commodities Leader  \u201cWhat we have pulled off over the last three years is\nunbelievable,\u201d Masters said during the July internal call. \u201cWe\nnow, post-merger and post-all the other work we\u2019ve done over the\nlast few years, have a phenomenal physical capability that\u2019s\nglobal, that involves storage, transportation across the\nworld.\u201d  Dimon, like his counterparts at other banks, is waiting\nimpatiently for the housing crisis to ease so the bank can rid\nitself of its huge portfolio of bad loans. In addition to the\nWaMu writedowns, the bank faces an avalanche of litigation over\nallegedly predatory and fraudulent WaMu mortgages and has set\naside a total of $3.5 billion in reserves to cover the cost of\nmounting lawsuits.  Dimon blames the continuing home-loan losses on house\nprices that keep falling, unemployment that remains high and an\neconomy that\u2019s recovering at a snail\u2019s pace. He predicted in\nApril 2008 that home prices would fall by a maximum of 9 percent\nover the rest of that year; they fell by 16.5 percent.
