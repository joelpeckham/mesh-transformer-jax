 "context": "The following article called 'Zynga COO Said to Lose Product Oversight as Growth Slows' was published on 2012-08-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nZynga Inc. (ZNGA)  Chief Operating Officer\nJohn Schappert was stripped of his role overseeing game\ndevelopment in a reorganization aimed at reviving growth and\nmaking more money from mobile services, people with knowledge of\nthe matter said.  David Ko, who runs Zynga\u2019s  mobile operations , and Steve Chiang, executive vice president of games -- both of whom\nreported to Schappert -- now report directly to Chief Executive\nOfficer  Mark Pincus , the social-gaming company said today,\nconfirming information from people who yesterday asked not to be\nidentified because the changes hadn\u2019t been made public.  \u201cWe reorganized our teams in July to integrate Web and\nmobile groups,\u201d Zynga said today in an e-mailed statement. .  Pincus embarked on the overhaul in early July, at the close\nof a quarter marked by slowing sales growth and a drop in demand\nfor virtual goods. Schappert, lured away last year from\n Electronic Arts Inc. (EA)  with a pay package worth $42.8 million, has\nlost support within the company and taken some of the blame for\nits underperformance, the people said.  \u201cThe place is in utter meltdown mode,\u201d  Richard Greenfield , an analyst at BTIG LLC in  New York , said yesterday\nin an interview. \u201cThe real question I think everyone should be\nasking is why it took reporting a collapse in earnings to make a\nmanagement change.\u201d  Shares of Zynga fell 4.8 percent to $2.81 at the close in\nNew York, the lowest price since the company held its initial\npublic offering in December. The stock has dropped 72 percent\nsince the market debut. The decline accelerated last week after\nZynga reported sales and profit that missed analysts\u2019\npredictions.  Mobile Priority  The reorganization was aimed in part at making mobile-\nsoftware development more of a priority across Zynga, the people\nsaid. Ko will work with Chiang to involve more of the company\u2019s\nbest designers on apps for smartphones and tablets, they said.  Zynga makes money by selling virtual goods within its games\n-- say, a gun in \u201cMafia Wars,\u201d or a tractor in \u201cFarmVille.\u201d  Renewed emphasis on mobile may help Zynga lessen its\nreliance on  Facebook Inc. (FB) , which accounts for about 80 percent\nof  bookings , or the total value of virtual goods sold in its\ngames. Zynga contributes 14 percent of Facebook\u2019s revenue, the\n Menlo Park , California-based social network said yesterday in a\nfiling.  Zynga may have had a duty to disclose the management\nchanges to shareholders in its second-quarter filings, BTIG\u2019s\nGreenfield said in a blog post today.  EA Veteran  \u201cWe are surprised that Zynga\u2019s public filings do not\nclearly explain what happened and why, given the importance of\nthe reasons behind the reorg, as well as the seniority of\nexecutives involved,\u201d Greenfield wrote.  Schappert joined Zynga in April 2011 after spending much of\nhis career at its chief rival. He began at Electronic Arts in\n1998 when the game giant acquired his development company,\nTiburon Studios. He left in 2007 to head Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Xbox\nLive unit before returning to EA in 2009 as president and chief\noperating officer.
