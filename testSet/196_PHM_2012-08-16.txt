 "context": "The following article called 'Building Permits in U.S. Increase to Four-Year High: Economy' was published on 2012-08-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmerican builders took out more\nresidential construction permits in July than at any time in the\npast four years, a sign the market will continue to improve.  Applications, a proxy for future work, rose to an 812,000\nannual rate, exceeding the highest estimate of economists\nsurveyed by Bloomberg and the most since August 2008, Commerce\nDepartment figures showed today in  Washington . Housing  starts \nfell 1.1 percent to a 746,000 rate from June\u2019s 754,000, which\nwas the strongest pace in more than three years.  Less costly properties combined with record-low  mortgage\nrates  are reviving demand, helping companies like  PulteGroup\nInc. (PHM)  boost profits. Another report showed Americans this month\nwere the most pessimistic on the economic outlook since late\nlast year as fuel costs climb, a hurdle that may prevent the\neconomy from strengthening in the second half of the year.  \u201cHousing is one of the bright spots in the economy,\u201d said\n Ryan Sweet , a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics Inc. in  West\nChester ,  Pennsylvania . \u201cThe recovery\u2019s resilience will be\ntested over the next couple months because of  Europe , the\nweakening in China, and also given that the consumer and\nbusiness moods are rather gloomy right now.\u201d  Stocks rose, sending the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index to its\nhighest level since April, as the increase in building permits\nbrightened the outlook for housing. The 500 Index climbed 0.7\npercent to 1,415.51 at the 4 p.m. close in  New York . The S&P\nSupercomposite Homebuilding Index advanced 4.4 percent.  Survey Results  Permits were projected to rise to a 769,000 pace, according\nto the  median estimate  of 52 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nEstimates ranged from 737,000 to 805,000.  Elsewhere today, U.K. retail sales unexpectedly rose in\nJuly as promotions helped to boost gasoline receipts and food\npurchases increased.  In  China , foreign direct investment fell in July to the\nlowest level in two years, fueling concern that waning\nconfidence in the nation\u2019s growth prospects may restrain any\neconomic rebound.  The share of U.S. households viewing the economy as heading\nin the wrong direction rose to 45 percent in August, the highest\nsince November, from 36 percent the prior month, the Bloomberg\nConsumer Comfort survey showed today. The  monthly expectations \ngauge dropped to minus 22 from minus 11 in July. The weekly\nBloomberg Consumer Comfort Index fell to minus 44.4 in the\nperiod ended Aug. 12, lowest since January, from minus 41.9.  \u201cThe American public appears to have tired of running\nharder to stand still, expressing their displeasure with the\ncurrent state of economic affairs in the country and their own\npersonal finances,\u201d said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior economist\nat Bloomberg LP in New York.  Spending Risks  The report raises the risk that a pickup in  retail sales \nlast month will not be sustained after gasoline prices climbed\nby 38 cents a gallon in less than two months. A jobless rate\nthat\u2019s exceeded 8 percent for a post-World War II record 42\nmonths is probably also contributing to concern that the world\u2019s\nlargest economy is failing to make enough progress.  Another report today signaled the job market is stabilizing\nafter hiring improved last month. The number of Americans filing\n claims  for jobless benefits was little changed last week,\nbringing the average over the past month to the lowest level\nsince late March, Labor Department data showed.  Filings climbed by 2,000 to 366,000 in the week ended Aug.\n11, in line with the  median  forecast of 45 economists surveyed\nby Bloomberg, which called for an increase to 365,000. The four-\nweek moving average, a less volatile measure, dropped to\n363,750, the fewest since the week ended March 31.  Starts Breakdown  The housing report showed starts of single-family houses\nfell 6.5 percent in July to a 502,000 rate, the first decline\nsince February. Work on multifamily homes, such as apartment\nbuildings, rose 12 percent to an annual rate of 244,000, a five-\nmonth high.  Three of four regions showed a decline, led by a 5.3\npercent decrease in the West. That area also showed the biggest\njump in permits, climbing 14 percent in July, taking them to the\nhighest level since June 2008. Construction applications in the\nWest soared 54 percent over the past 12 months, the biggest\nyear-to-year jump since December 1986.  Residential construction leaders are turning less\npessimistic. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells\nFargo index of builder  confidence  climbed in August to the\nhighest level in more than five years, the Washington-based\ngroup said yesterday.  Spurring Demand  Low borrowing costs and cheaper homes are helping spur\ndemand. The average rate on a  30-year fixed  mortgage dropped to\n3.49 percent in the week ended July 26, the lowest in records\ndating to 1971, according to McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac .\nThe  median price  of a new house was down 3.2 percent in June\nfrom the same time last year, according to figures from the\nCommerce Department.  PulteGroup, the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue, posted\na better-than-estimated profit and a 32 percent jump in orders\nin the second quarter. The  Bloomfield Hills , Michigan-based\ncompany is seeing the market improve, while it had entered 2012\nassuming new home sales would be little-changed from 2011,\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard J. Dugas said.  \u201cWe have been pleasantly surprised as demand throughout\nthe selling season and extending into these initial weeks of\nJuly has exceeded our expectations,\u201d Dugas said on a July 26\nconference call with analysts.  Facing Headwinds  Still, \u201cmany of the macro drivers of demand really haven\u2019t\nchanged all that much,\u201d he said, citing high unemployment, weak\nconsumer sentiment and concern over Europe\u2019s debt crisis and\nimpending U.S. tax changes.  Some of those headwinds may be holding back producers.\nManufacturing in the Philadelphia region contracted in August\nfor a fourth consecutive month as orders and employment\ndeclined, another report today showed.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia\u2019s general economic\n index  improved to minus 7.1 in August from minus 12.9 the\nprevious month. Economists forecast the gauge would climb to\nminus 5, according to the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey.\nA reading of zero is the dividing point between contraction and\nexpansion in the area covering eastern Pennsylvania, southern\n New Jersey  and  Delaware .
