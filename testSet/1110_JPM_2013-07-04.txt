 "context": "The following article called 'Fidelity Sees Bargains as 98% of Asia Bonds Sink: Credit Markets' was published on 2013-07-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe worst corporate-bond rout since\nthe credit crisis left 98 percent of Asia\u2019s dollar-denominated\nbonds sold last quarter at a discount, a sign to Fidelity\nWorldwide Investment it\u2019s time to buy.  A total of 60 bonds issued by borrowers from  China  to India\nand  Indonesia  in the past three months are now trading below\ntheir sale price, with six of the 10 biggest declines coming\nfrom investment-grade companies that sold longer-dated notes.\nChina Petroleum & Chemical Corp., Asia\u2019s largest refiner, led\nthe retreat as the $500 million of 30-year bonds it issued in\nApril fell almost 16 cents on the dollar through June 30,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While speculation the Federal Reserve will start paring its\nunprecedented bond buying and China\u2019s clampdown on its shadow\nbanking system triggered a global selloff that pushed borrowing\ncosts in Asia to a 12-month high, the exodus is now giving debt\ninvestors a chance to scoop up bargains, according to Fidelity\u2019s\nBryan Collins. The extra yield investment-grade bonds from Asian\ncompanies offer over U.S. Treasuries rose to 2.34 percentage\npoints on June 26, the most since September, according to Bank\nof America Merrill Lynch.  \u201cSpreads are actually quite attractive, especially for\nsome of the higher quality names where you can be very\ncomfortable about the credit and the stability of the\nbusiness,\u201d Collins, a Hong Kong-based money manager at\nFidelity, which oversees $248 billion, said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cIt does absolutely present a buying opportunity\u201d\nfor investors who can protect against rising yields, he said.  China Picks  Fidelity is adding to its Asian debt funds some high-quality bonds that are less sensitive to the economy, Collins\nsaid. Looking in the medium to longer term, A rated and AA rated\nlarge companies that are systemically important and related to\nstate-owned enterprises are attractive at current spreads,\naccording to Collins.  Cnooc Ltd., China\u2019s biggest offshore oil explorer and\ngraded AA- by Standard & Poor\u2019s, had the third-biggest losses\nlast quarter with its 30-year bonds. Debentures sold by Sinochem\nCorp. and Golden Eagle Retail Group Ltd. were also among the 10\nworst performers, Bloomberg prices show.  Globally, corporate and high-yield debt lost 2.2 percent in\nthe second quarter, the most since the third quarter of 2008,\nBank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. Corporate debt from\nAsian  emerging markets  lost 4.1 percent while investment-grade\ndebt from the region retreated 4.4 percent, both the most in 4\n1/2-years, the indexes show.  \u2018Potential Headwinds\u2019  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke roiled markets last month when\nhe said the central bank may taper its unprecedented stimulus\nthis year and halt bond purchases around mid-2014, so long as\nthe U.S. economy performs as forecast. Yields on 10-year\nTreasuries climbed, ranging between 2.08 percent and 2.61\npercent last month, according to Bloomberg Indexes.  Some $60 billion has been pulled from U.S. bond funds since\nthen as investors, who fled volatile stock markets to pour about\n$1 trillion into fixed-income securities since the beginning of\n2009, reversed that pattern in anticipation of rising rates.  \u201cAfter this correction, valuations look less tight and a\nbit more attractive,\u201d said Luc Froehlich, a Hong Kong-based\nportfolio manager in Manulife Asset Management\u2019s Asia fixed-income team, which oversees more than $44 billion. \u201cBut it\u2019s\nreally hard to nail down the best moment to pick up those bonds.\nI still see some potential headwinds from fund flows out of\nemerging markets.\u201d  Default Swaps  Elsewhere in the credit markets, the cost of insuring\ncorporate bonds against losses fell in Europe this week.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps on\n125 investment-grade companies dropped 6.5 basis points to\n112.6, the lowest since June 19, as of 3:43 p.m. in  London \nyesterday. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Markit iTraxx Asia\nindex of 40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan climbed 8.9\nbasis points in the period to 161.3 basis points in Hong Kong.  The indexes typically rise as investor confidence\ndeteriorates and fall as it improves. A basis point equals\n$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Investment-grade bonds, which were little changed this\nweek, have decreased 4.15 percent this year, according to the\nBloomberg Global Investment Grade  Corporate Bond Index (BCOR)  as of\nJuly 3.  Fund Flows  Sinochem\u2019s $600 million of 5 percent notes sold in April at\npar were trading at 88.77 cents on the dollar to yield 6.21\npercent as of July 4, Bloomberg-compiled prices show. Cnooc\u2019s\n4.25 percent of $500 million securities, sold at 98.515 cents on\nthe dollar, were trading at 84.38 cents and yielding 5.29\npercent.  \u201cFundamentals haven\u2019t changed over the last six weeks but\nperceptions and risk appetites have,\u201d said Suanjin Tan, a\nSingapore-based Asia fixed-income portfolio manager at BlackRock\nInc. \u201cThe upheavals we\u2019ve seen over the last few weeks have\ncreated certain dislocations in the market, and have provided\nopportunities we can take advantage of both in a relative value\nas well as an absolute sense.\u201d  Investors pulled a record $23.3 billion from global bond\nfunds in the week ending June 26, with outflows from emerging\nmarkets jumping to an all-time high, according to EPFR Global.  India, China  Investment-grade bonds in India and China are however\nperforming better than Russian or Brazilian debt this month,\nBank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show, returning 0.33\npercent and 0.31 percent respectively.  The  cost of insuring  Asian investment-grade sovereign and\ncorporate bonds from non-payment fell for the first time in\nseven weeks in the period to June 28, ending the longest streak\nof increases since July 2008, according to data provider CMA.  Perceptions of Export-Import Bank of China\u2019s\ncreditworthiness improved most, with credit-default swaps on the\nAA- rated lender falling 36.5 basis points, according to CMA,\nwhich is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by\ndealers in the private market.  Bank of China Ltd. and China Development Bank Corp. were\nthe second and third best performers respectively.  \u201cThe investment-grade market will snap back,\u201d according\nto Murlidhar Maiya, the head of debt capital markets for Asia\nex- Japan  at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Hong Kong. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard\nto nuance these corrections. You overshoot in both directions\nand that\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen this sell off.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nRachel Evans in Hong Kong at \n revans43@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nKatrina Nicholas at \n knicholas2@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 41.85219955444336 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
