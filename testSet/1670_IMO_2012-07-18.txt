 "context": "The following article called 'Shell-Led Arctic Push Finds U.S. Shy in Icebreakers: Energy' was published on 2012-07-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  has spent $4.5\nbillion since 2005 preparing to explore for oil off Alaska\u2019s\nnorth coast in the Arctic. U.S. taxpayers may end up paying\nalmost as much to supervise future operations in the region.  Shell, which may begin drilling next month, is one of at\nleast six companies planning to extract oil, gas and minerals in\nthe Arctic as global warming melts ice and opens new sea lanes\nto commerce. As the companies move in, so must the Coast Guard,\nto defend U.S. interests, perform sea rescues and coordinate the\ngovernment\u2019s response to any oil spills.  The Coast Guard is ill-equipped for the Arctic. It lacks\nappropriate communications and navigation systems, and will need\nat least $3 billion in additional vessels and equipment,\nassessments by the  Congressional Research Service  and the Coast\nGuard itself show. Without more icebreakers, the service will be\n\u201cunable to accomplish its Arctic missions,\u201d according to a\nreport last year by the Homeland Security Department\u2019s inspector\ngeneral.  \u201cThe Coast Guard has zero capability in the Arctic,\u201d\nAdmiral Robert Papp, the Coast Guard commandant, said in a July\n13 interview at a Bloomberg Government breakfast in  Washington .\n\u201cIf we are going to have a permanent presence there, it\u2019s going\nto require some investment. We don\u2019t have the infrastructure in\nplace right now.\u201d  Laying Plans  Countries and companies are laying plans for the Arctic,\nwhich holds about a fourth of the word\u2019s undiscovered oil and\nnatural gas, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey . The U.S.\nhas more than 1,000 miles of Arctic shoreline. Much of its oil\nis off the Alaskan North Slope, which is bordered by the\nBeaufort and Chukchi seas and about 1,100 miles northwest of\nJuneau, the state capital.  Russia  in 2007 dropped a capsule containing its flag on the\nseabed 14,000 feet below the  North Pole , staking a claim for oil\nand gas reserves there.  Canada  plans to purchase military\nicebreakers to protect its interests.  China , which doesn\u2019t have\nan Arctic border, has signed energy agreements with Iceland.  The Hague-based  Shell (RDS/A) , Europe\u2019s biggest oil company, will\nbe the first to resume operations in the Arctic. It was last\nexplored in the early 1990s, before lower  oil prices  reduced\nprofit prospects. Shell is awaiting final approval from the U.S.\nto begin drilling.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Statoil Asa (STL)  of  Norway  also have won\nrights to explore fields in the Arctic.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the\nbiggest energy company by market value, has reached an agreement\nwith Russia to explore its area of Arctic. Other  companies  with\nplans for the region include  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  and\n Chevron Corp. (CVX)   Icebreakers Critical  Even as ice recedes, the Arctic remains a vast frozen area\nwith hurricane-strength storms, below-freezing  temperatures  and\nlarge ice floes, making icebreakers critical.  \u201cEven with the open sea lanes, the Arctic is immensely\ndangerous,\u201d Peter Harrison, director of the school of policy\nstudies at Queen\u2019s University in Ontario, whose work focuses on\nthe Arctic, said at a Brookings Institution conference on the\nsubject last month. \u201cIf anyone thinks it\u2019s like Lake Michigan\nin July and August, they are dreaming in Technicolor.\u201d  Papp said the Coast Guard eventually would need three\nheavy-duty and three medium-duty icebreakers for the Arctic. It\nnow has one medium-duty icebreaker and two heavy-duty ones\ndating from the 1970s, neither of which is currently operable.\nThe service plans to repair one of them.  That means the U.S. would need to build four icebreakers --\ntwo heavy-duty and two medium-duty -- with an estimated total\ncost of $3.2 billion, according to a Congressional Research\nService report in April.  \u2018Pay Attention\u2019  Neither Congress nor the administration of President  Barack Obama  has proposed spending that kind of money on icebreakers.\nThe Obama fiscal 2013 budget has called for $8 million to study\nbuilding one. The Coast Guard\u2019s five-year plan has called for\n$852 million for its actual construction in subsequent years,\nalthough Congress has yet to address the funding. It can take as\nlong as 10 years to build an icebreaker.  Russia has 25 icebreakers, which are being used \u201cto assert\nsovereign control over the Arctic region and its valuable\nresources,\u201d according to the Congressional Research Service\nreport.  Finland and Sweden have seven icebreakers each and Canada\nhas six, the report says. China has one icebreaker and another\nunder construction.  Exercises Beginning  \u201cThis is an internationally competitive area where we must\nstart paying attention,\u201d Representative  David Price , a North\nCarolina Democrat and ranking member of a House Appropriations\nsubcommittee in charge of allocating the money, said in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cThe Coast Guard is going to be called on\nto do a lot of things up there and we can\u2019t limp along with our\ncurrent icebreaker capacity.\u201d  For the Shell drilling, the Coast Guard plans to send two\nhelicopters and two cutters to the Arctic, including one of its\nthree flagship National Security Cutters.  The Coast Guard opened a temporary base in Barrow, Alaska,\non July 16. It will practice oil-spill responses as well as\nother maneuvers to test equipment and personnel readiness, said\nVice Admiral Peter Neffenger, deputy commandant for operations\nat the service, in a telephone interview.  \u201cOur goal is to have a presence up there that can\nadequately address the activity for this summer and then to\nthink about what it means for the future,\u201d he said.  The ships and equipment will have to be pulled from Coast\nGuard duties elsewhere, Commandant Papp said.  No More Resources  \u201cThe problem with that is no one is giving me any\nadditional resources to take on this new mission,\u201d Papp said in\nthe interview. The cutter in the Arctic is \u201cnot going to be\nable to do drug interdiction in the eastern Pacific on the drug\nroutes from  South America . We\u2019re going to have to pull other\nships off fishery patrols in the western Pacific from a Naval\nexercise in the western Pacific.\u201d  Placing a National Security Cutter in the Arctic will help\nbecause the ship can function as an air station and\ncommunications center, and has three boats for rescue missions\nand security operations, he said.  \u201cIt gives us immediate capabilities and infrastructure in\nthe summer, and when the ice starts forming we can pull it\nback,\u201d Papp said.  Shell\u2019s Preparation  The U.S. plan to oversee the drilling is inadequate and\nfavors Shell at the expense of taxpayers, said Michael Conathan,\ndirector of Ocean Policy at the Center for American Progress, a\nWashington-based research firm.  \u201cThose are not assets that were just sitting on a shelf\nsomewhere waiting to be deployed,\u201d Conathan said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cInstead of doing other jobs, they will be\nbabysitting Shell\u2019s operations and the American taxpayer will be\non the hook.\u201d  Shell is bringing its own equipment for the job and\nemergencies, including 33 vessels and 600 workers, said Steve\nPhelps, Shell\u2019s manager of exploration for  Alaska .  \u201cWe know the region is very remote and very dangerous,\u201d\nPhelps said at the Brookings Institution forum. \u201cWe realize if\nwe need it, we have to bring it.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nin Washington at \n cwolf@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nStephanie Stoughton at \n sstoughton@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Imperial Oil Limited was 35.90097427368164 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Imperial Oil Limited was ",
