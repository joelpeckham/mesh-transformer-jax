 "context": "The following article called 'Nasdaq Working Quietly to Curb Bank Control of Clearinghouses' was published on 2010-12-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe revelation that regulators\nreceived forged letters denouncing banks\u2019 \u201ccartel-like\ncontrol\u201d of derivatives trading has exposed the latest front in\na yearlong battle over which companies gain entr\u00e9e into the $583\ntrillion swaps market.  The letter campaign, orchestrated by a public relations\nfirm, contained the same message that  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.  has\nbeen pushing in Washington as it tries to muscle its way into\nthe derivatives business. The company\u2019s plan: get Congress or\nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission to limit bank ownership\nof swaps clearinghouses, helping Nasdaq get a bigger piece of\nthe pie.  Nasdaq\u2019s efforts have included hiring the ex-chairman of\nthe House Financial Services Committee to lobby former\ncolleagues, sending the company\u2019s chief executive officer to\nprivate meetings with lawmakers and even circulating an\nanonymous flier on Capitol Hill. The flier, which Nasdaq\neventually acknowledged drafting, also denounced Wall Street\nfirms as an \u201cabusive cartel.\u201d  Nasdaq has done much of its lobbying in secret, letting\norganizations such as the AFL-CIO labor federation step out in\npublic. The New York-based company declined to say whether it\nhired the firm responsible for the faked comment letters.  The secrecy may be necessary; In the inter-connected ways\nof Wall Street, if Nasdaq\u2019s clearinghouse wants to be\nsuccessful, it needs to keep the banks as customers.  \u2018Dangerous\u2019  \u201cIt is dangerous to state openly what they feel, because\nthose banks can decide to take their business elsewhere,\u201d said\n Michael Greenberger , a former CFTC official who is now a\nUniversity of Maryland law professor.  The skirmish is a vivid illustration of how companies turn\nto Washington to gain an advantage via the law that they can\u2019t\nget in the marketplace.  Nasdaq and large derivatives dealers -- including  JPMorgan\nChase & Co. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG --\nare still making their case at the CFTC, which will consider the\nownership caps in mid-January.  The regulatory melee was set off by the Obama\nadministration\u2019s decision to overhaul financial regulation in\nthe wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank law,\nenacted in July, aims to have most derivatives processed through\nclearinghouses and traded on exchanges for the first time.  Nasdaq and  its competitors  are positioning themselves to\ntake advantage of that move. The banks say clearinghouses need\nowners with enough capital and expertise to weather market\ndisruptions. Allowing companies with fewer resources to have\nlarge ownership stakes in clearinghouses could increase the risk\nto the system, they say.  Higher Prices  Unions and investor advocates say that banks\u2019 near-monopoly\nhas driven the prices of derivatives higher for everybody. More\ntransparency in those markets will lower the costs for all\ncompanies buying derivatives, which in turn will bring down the\ncosts not only of financial products but consumer goods based on\nagricultural or energy commodities -- everything from loaves of\nbread to gallons of heating oil or gasoline.  \u201cWhat the progressives are concerned about here is the\nongoing control of clearinghouses by institutions that are\nmaking money by keeping things opaque,\u201d said Heather Slavkin, a\nlobbyist for the AFL-CIO.  Nasdaq lost the first round of the regulatory battle this\nyear when Congress decided not to set caps on clearinghouse\nownership, passing the decision on to regulators -- the CFTC as\nwell as the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Arkansas Letters  Nasdaq didn\u2019t submit a public written response last month\nwhen the CFTC proposed the ownership rule. At the same time, the\nagency did receive letters supporting Nasdaq\u2019s position that\nwere purportedly from Arkansas residents, including a rural\ncounty sheriff and a Burger King franchise owner.  Bloomberg News reported last month that those letters were\nforgeries generated as part of a campaign by the Dewey Square\nGroup, a Boston-based political consulting firm. The U.S.\nJustice Department is investigating.  Nasdaq\u2019s chief spokesman,  Frank De Maria , issued a \u201cno\ncomment\u201d when asked whether the company hired the consultants\nto create the impression that citizens throughout the country\nwere concerned about bank ownership of clearinghouses. De Maria\nalso declined repeated requests to comment for this story.  Interest-rate swaps are the largest share of the swaps\nmarket, totaling around $348 trillion a year. It\u2019s that part of\nthe derivatives market that Nasdaq is angling toward. Analysts\nat Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. estimated last week that Dodd-\nFrank requirements would double revenue from interest-rate swaps\nclearing to $610 million in 2012.  Main Competitors  Nasdaq\u2019s main competitors are London-based LCH.Clearnet\nGroup Ltd., which is majority-owned by banks, and Chicago-based\nCME Group Inc., the world\u2019s largest futures exchange.  Five commercial banks hold 97 percent of all over-the-\ncounter derivatives, according to the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency. To date, the share of the business controlled\nby Nasdaq\u2019s two-year-old clearinghouse for interest-rate swaps,\nthe International Derivatives Clearing Group LLC, has been\nsmall: about $400 million in open-interest trades as of Dec. 13.\nCME Group, which started clearing interest-rate swaps on Oct.\n18, had a total of $926 million in open-interest trades in its\ninterest rate swaps clearinghouse as of Dec. 16.  Nasdaq hasn\u2019t been able to keep its interest in derivatives\nclearinghouses entirely under wraps. Company CEO  Robert Greifeld \ncame to Washington and met in person with members of the House\nand Senate, according to two congressional aides who were\npresent.  Michael Oxley , a former Ohio representative who is an\nadviser to Nasdaq\u2019s board, stood near the House floor during a\nvote on the ownership amendment where reporters saw him\nbuttonholing fellow Republicans. Though banks lobbied against\nthe amendment, 18 Republicans broke ranks to vote for it.  Lynch Amendment  Passage was touch-and-go. At first the ownership\nrestrictions were excluded from the text of the bill that\nreached the House floor in December 2009. Then Representative\n Stephen Lynch , a Massachusetts Democrat, offered an amendment\nrestricting banks from owning more than 20 percent of a\nclearinghouse; that\u2019s when the anonymous flier -- titled \u201cMyths\nThat the TARP Banks Are Spreading About the Lynch Amendment\u201d --\nbegan to circulate.  After a Nasdaq lawyer was revealed through computer coding\nto have drafted the flier\u2019s text, the company admitted\nresponsibility to Dow Jones Newswires. The company\u2019s general\ncounsel,  Ed Knight  described Lynch\u2019s proposal as \u201ca modest\namendment\u201d that \u201cwe find ourselves in agreement with,\u201d\naccording to the trade publication Clearing Quarterly Directory.  In an interview, Lynch said Nasdaq didn\u2019t originate the\nidea for the amendment. After he introduced it, Nasdaq officials\ndid visit him, however, and debated the details with him.  Left to Regulators  Though the language eventually passed the House, the final\nversion of the Dodd-Frank law left it up to regulators to decide\nwhether to set ownership limits. In October, the CFTC proposed\nthat clearinghouses should be required to choose between two\ntypes of ownership restrictions.  Under the first, there would be a 20 percent cap on a\nclearinghouse member\u2019s equity stake or voting control and a 40\npercent cap on the collective stake that members and restricted\nnon-member companies -- including banks -- could hold in one\nclearinghouse.  The second option would impose a 5 percent cap on the\nownership stake and control any clearinghouse member or non-\nmember could have. The second option wouldn\u2019t include an\naggregate cap. The 5 percent limit would likely enable\nLCH.Clearnet to maintain its current ownership structure.  In recent months, representatives of Nasdaq have visited\nthe CFTC and the SEC to discuss clearinghouse ownership,\naccording to disclosures posted on the agencies\u2019 web sites.  Banks\u2019 Comments  In comments posted on the CFTC site, Goldman Sachs,\nJPMorgan and other banks oppose setting strict limits on\nownership. A letter from the Securities Industry and Financial\nMarkets Association suggests that banks view the lobbying as an\nattempt by the losing side to reopen the battle.  \u201cWe do not believe there is a sufficient basis for the\nCommissions to conclude it is necessary to adopt rules that\nwould impose aggregate ownership limits that are substantially\nsimilar to those that were proposed by Rep. Lynch -- and which\nhe now urges upon the Commissions -- but rejected by Congress,\u201d\nwrote  Kenneth Bentsen Jr ., Sifma\u2019s executive vice president for\npublic policy.  Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News, intends to register\nas a swap-execution facility,  Ben Macdonald , the company\u2019s\nglobal head of fixed income, said in a Nov. 17 comment letter to\nthe CFTC. The letter doesn\u2019t comment specifically about the\nproposed ownership limits.  The Swaps and Derivatives Markets Association, a group of\nsmaller players that wants access to clearinghouses, supports\nNasdaq\u2019s position that clearinghouse ownership shouldn\u2019t be\ndominated by swaps dealers.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about the big guys and the little guys,\u201d said\n Jamie Cawley , a founder of the organization. \u201cIt\u2019s about making\nsure that we strike the right balance so that governance\nstructures are truly representative of the marketplace they\u2019re\ngoing to be serving.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\n Clea Benson  in Washington at \n Cbenson20@bloomberg.net ;\n Robert Schmidt  in Washington at \n rschmidt5@bloomberg.net ;\nSilla Brush in Washington at \n sbrush@bloomberg.net .
