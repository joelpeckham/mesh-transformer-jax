 "context": "The following article called 'Spain Has First General Strike in Decade as Europe Marches' was published on 2010-09-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSpanish workers disrupted transport\nand television broadcasts in the first general strike in eight\nyears as demonstrators marched in a dozen European cities\nagainst government spending cuts.  More than 100,000 protesters descended on  Brussels  before a\nmeeting between  union  members and European Commission President\n Jose Barroso , organizers said. In Athens, rail, communications\nand port workers struck. Police in Dublin made an arrest after a\ntruck damaged the front gates of the parliament building.  Spain\u2019s two biggest unions said 72 percent of workers\njoined the strike, including 65 percent in the energy sector and\n82 percent in the airline industry, according to Jose Javier\nCubillo of the UGT union. Labor Minister  Celestino Corbacho  said\nthe strike had a \u201cmoderate\u201d impact, with 7.5 percent of state\nworkers and \u201calmost 100 percent\u201d of auto workers joining the\nwalkout. Power demand was 17 percent below a forecast made by\ngrid operator  Red Electrica Corp. SA  based on usual demand, as\nof 6:20 p.m.  \u201cThe strike has been an unquestionable success,\u201d  Ignacio Fernandez Toxo , head of the CCOO union, told a news conference\nin Madrid. He called on the government to abandon plans to raise\nthe retirement age and to revise the 2011 budget that goes to\nparliament tomorrow.  Deficit Concern  Spanish unions turned against the Socialist Prime Minister\n Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , a former ally, after he enacted\nthe deepest budget reductions in at least three decades and\nweakened job security to cut Europe\u2019s highest  unemployment  rate.\nZapatero\u2019s about-face stemmed from demands from investors and\nEuropean partners that he narrow the budget shortfall after the\nGreek debt crisis.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year\nbonds instead of German equivalents rose to 196 basis points\ntoday, compared with 193 basis points yesterday and a two-month\nlow of 137 basis points on July 27. Moody\u2019s Investors Service is\ndue to complete a review of Spain\u2019s credit rating tomorrow, the\nsame day the budget goes to Parliament.  \u201cA disappointing budget combined with an effective general\nstrike and a rating review on 30 September could supply that\ncatalyst\u201d for investors to sell Spanish debt, said  Robert Crossley , a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London.  Governments across Europe are imposing austerity to rein in\ndeficits accrued as leaders implemented stimulus programs to\npull their economies out of the worst recession in six decades.\nFrench unions are planning further protests against President\n Nicolas Sarkozy \u2019s plan to raise the retirement age, following\ntwo strikes on Sept. 7 and 23.  Closed Kiosks  Protesters set a police car alight and torched dumpsters in\nBarcelona, where eight people were arrested, a police spokesman\nsaid. In Madrid, 38 people were detained for damaging property\nand gluing up doorways, while police identified 1,500 people who\nformed pickets, a spokesman for the government\u2019s representative\nin the Madrid region said in a telephone interview.  Telemadrid , the television station of the Madrid region,\nstopped broadcasting because of the strike. Newspapers kiosks in\ncentral Madrid were closed or without newspapers, even as stores\nopened and the metro operated. Corbacho said 21 percent of\ntransport workers joined the walkout. Frankfurt airport canceled\n22 flights because of the Spanish strike and  Iberia Lineas\nAereas de Espana SA  said it would operate 35 percent of its\nflights.  Refineries Stable  Repsol YPF SA , the country\u2019s biggest oil company, said\nproduction at its refineries wasn\u2019t disrupted.  Cia Espanola de\nPetroleos SA  said its refinery in Huelva operated normally while\n EDP-Energias de Portugal SA  said its plants hadn\u2019t been\naffected. About 3.9 percent of banking staff joined the walkout,\nsaid a spokeswoman for the Spanish Banking Association, which\nrepresents commercial lenders.  The government had negotiated minimum services with unions,\nincluding 25 percent services on suburban rail lines, and\nCorbacho said today that agreed services were being provided.  The turnout cited by unions was higher than participation\nlevels forecast in a poll in  El Pais  newspaper on Sept. 5. Just\n9 percent of workers \u201cdefinitely\u201d planned to join the walkout,\naccording to the poll, down from 15 percent in a July survey.\nFifty-five percent were sure they won\u2019t join today\u2019s protest, up\nfrom 50 percent two months ago.  Talks Sought  After defending higher pensions, subsidies for new mothers\nand benefits for people caring for dependents since winning\npower in 2004, Zapatero  cut public  wages by 5 percent in June\nand froze all but the lowest pensions for 2011.  The prime minister aims to cut the euro region\u2019s third-\nlargest budget  deficit  to 6 percent of gross domestic product in\n2011 from 11.1 percent last year. The budget plan will be voted\non next month in Parliament, where the ruling Socialists don\u2019t\nhave a majority and are negotiating with lawmakers from smaller\nparties for support.  The government has said that the strike won\u2019t make it\nchange direction and the labor overhaul that unions are\nprotesting is already in force. Zapatero repeated today that he\nwants to include unions in negotiations on an overhaul to the\npension system that he plans by the end of the year.  A public-sector strike on June 8 received the backing of 12\npercent of workers, according to the government, or 75 percent\naccording to the two unions. Total union membership in Spain is\n14 percent, according to data from the  Organization of Economic\nCooperation and Development . That compares with 24 percent in\nGreece and 33 percent in Italy, the OECD figures show.
