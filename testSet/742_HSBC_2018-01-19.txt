The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n(Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) on Thursday agreed to pay $101.5 million to settle a U.S. criminal probe into the rigging of currency transactions, which has already led the conviction of one of its former bankers.\nThe payment includes a $63.1 million fine plus $38.4 million in restitution to a corporate client, according to a deferred prosecution agreement filed on Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York.\nIn the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, HSBC also agreed to bolster its internal controls, and admitted and accepted responsibility for wrongdoing underlying two criminal wire fraud charges filed on Thursday against the bank, according to the agreement.\nDeferred prosecution agreements let companies avoid criminal charges so long as they comply with the terms.\nThursday\u2019s sanctions came a month after HSBC was freed from a five-year deferred prosecution agreement over its alleged dealings with Mexican drug cartels and other money launderers, and conducting of transactions for customers in countries barred by U.S. sanctions. It was fined $1.92 billion in that case.\nIn October, a federal jury in Brooklyn convicted Mark Johnson, the former head of HSBC\u2019s global foreign exchange cash trading desk, of trading ahead of a $3.5 billion currency transaction by his client Cairn Energy Plc ( CNE.L ).\nJohnson has yet to be sentenced. Stuart Scott, HSBC\u2019s former head of cash trading for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was also charged in that case and has fought extradition.\nHSBC agreed to pay Cairn $8.08 million under a settlement reached in July, which the Justice Department said it credited as \u201cfull restitution\u201d to that company.\nIn a statement on Thursday, HSBC said the $63.1 million fine reflected a 15 percent reduction that took into account the bank\u2019s cooperation and \u201cextensive remediation\u201d efforts.\nThe case is U.S. v. HSBC Holdings Plc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 18-cr-00030.\nReporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 46.04726028442383 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
