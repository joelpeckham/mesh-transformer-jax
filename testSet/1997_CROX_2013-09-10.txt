That weakness was partly\ncountered by stronger-than-anticipated revenue and comparable\nstore performance in the Asia Pacific and Europe regions, the\nNiwot, Colorado-based company said today in a statement.  Net income for the period ending Sept. 30 will be 15 cents\nto 18 cents a share, down from a prior forecast for as much as\n23 cents, Crocs said.

Analysts\npredicted $305.1 million, on average.
