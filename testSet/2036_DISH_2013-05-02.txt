(CLWR) , the money-losing\nwireless-service provider, said it needs at least $1.7 billion\nto cover a cash shortage and continue operating.  The company, based in Bellevue,  Washington , needs the funds\nthrough 2014 to make up for the shortfall, it said in a filing\nyesterday. The shortfall reflects \u201cless certain revenues and\nhigh fixed costs,\u201d it said.  Clearwire, which is majority owned by  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) ,\nsaid last month it will draw $80 million in financing from\nSprint for a third straight month, leaning on the wireless\ncarrier for funding as it awaits a shareholder vote on a\nproposal by Sprint to buy the rest of the company.  Rival suitor  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , seeking to gain control of\nvaluable airwaves, has offered $25 billion for control of Sprint\nand $3.30 a share for Clearwire stock, more than Sprint\u2019s $2.97-\na-share offer.  In the  filing  yesterday, Clearwire said Sprint\u2019s offer\n\u201cprovides a compelling value to Clearwire minority\nshareholders.\u201d As part of the evaluation of the Sprint offer,\nClearwire provided two business scenarios in which it requires\n$2 billion to $4 billion in additional funding through 2017.  Under its current structure, the \u201cprospects of securing\nfunding are highly uncertain,\u201d it said in the filing.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , the second-largest U.S. phone\ncompany, offered Clearwire $1 billion to $1.5 billion for\nairwaves in major cities, the New York-based company said last\nmonth. Clearwire reiterated in yesterday\u2019s filing that a special\ncommittee would review the proposal.  Clearwire shareholders are scheduled to vote on Sprint\u2019s\noffer on May 21.  The company\u2019s stock fell 1.5 percent to $3.31 at the close\nin New York yesterday. Sprint rose less than 1 percent to $7.06,\nwhile Dish declined less than 1 percent to $39.14.
