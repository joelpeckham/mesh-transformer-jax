 "context": "The following article called 'Coking Coal Benchmark to Fall on Lower Use, Davenport Says' was published on 2012-09-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe global coking coal benchmark for\nthe fourth quarter may fall to $175 a ton on lower demand for\nthe steelmaking component, Davenport & Co. LLC said today.  The investment bank lowered its estimate by 17 percent and\nsaid that prices will average $205 a ton for 2013 and $215 for\n2014 as global steel production slows, down from earlier\nforecasts of $218 and $225.  Davenport is at least the third investment bank this week\nto lower metallurgical coal projections, citing soft demand in\n Europe  and  China  as well as recovering production in  Australia ,\nthe world\u2019s biggest exporter of the component.  \u201cMet market conditions are very challenging currently and\nwe do not anticipate a significant rebound in the near term,\u201d\nJ. Christopher Haberlin, an analyst at Davenport in Richmond,\n Virginia , said in the report.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world\u2019s biggest coking coal\nexporter, in July lifted a force majeure on its Queensland,\nAustralia, operations after navigating rolling work stoppages.  \u201cHowever, other producers are responding by idling mines\nand reducing production,\u201d Haberlin said. \u201cWe expect softer\ndemand to trump the supply response in the near term, keeping\nthe global met market muted through the end of the year.\u201d  Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) , a U.S. producer of metallurgical coal,\nsaid Sept. 4 that it would cut production by a \u201csmall amount\u201d\nat its operation in Wales. The same day  Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , the\nlargest U.S. coal company by market value, said it would idle\nits Buchanan mine in Virginia and at least part of its Amonate\ncomplex in  West Virginia .  Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF) , in  St. Petersburg , Florida,\nand Dahlman Rose & Co., in  New York , both lowered their\nmetallurgical coal price projections this week.  The benchmark contract for the third quarter is $225 a ton,\ndown 29 percent from a year earlier, when the market wrestled\nwith supply disruptions in Queensland.
