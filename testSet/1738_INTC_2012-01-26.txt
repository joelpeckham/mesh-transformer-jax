 "context": "The following article called 'Obama Promotes Breaks for Manufacturers Keeping Jobs in U.S.' was published on 2012-01-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPresident  Barack Obama  said\nmanufacturers must be rewarded for bringing jobs back to the\nU.S. from overseas and expanding at home to set a foundation for\njob creation and growth.  Following up on last night\u2019s State of the Union speech,\nObama today expanded on his proposals for encouraging\nmanufacturing and energy production. He said the actions his\nadministration already has taken are helping the U.S. recover\nfrom the recession.  \u201cToday, three years after the worst economic storm in\nthree generations, we are making progress,\u201d Obama said in Cedar\nRapids,  Iowa .  He spoke at Conveyor Engineering & Manufacturing, which\nmakes screw-type conveyors for moving materials such as feed,\ngrain and chemicals for farming and processing facilities and\nwhich Obama said represents the kind of home-grown industry the\nU.S. must encourage.  Accelerating the recovery and trimming the jobless rate,\nwhich was 8.5 percent in December, will be crucial to Obama\u2019s\nchances of winning a second term in November. The two leading\ncandidates for the Republican nomination,  Mitt Romney  and  Newt Gingrich  are making criticism of Obama\u2019s stewardship of the\neconomy a focus of their stump speeches.  Engine of Growth  Manufacturing has been an engine of growth for the U.S.\nOutput climbed 0.9 percent last month, the biggest gain since\nDecember 2010, according to Federal Reserve data. U.S.\nmanufacturers have added more than 300,000 jobs since December\n2009, the White House said in a fact sheet, growing for the\nfirst time since the late 1990s.  The manufacturing measures are part of what Obama called a\n\u201cblueprint for an economy that\u2019s built to last.\u201d It was part\nof a list of initiatives the president laid out in his address\nthat included expanding domestic energy production, bolstering\njob training, aiding homeowners with underwater mortgages and\nstreamlining government operations.  Manufacturing was highlighted by Obama at a stop later in\nthe day in Chandler,  Arizona , about 20 miles (32 kilometers)\nsoutheast of Phoenix, where  Intel Corp. (INTC)  has a manufacturing\nplant. The world\u2019s largest chipmaker says the facility employs\n9,700 people and is building another $5 billion microprocessor\nplant.  Minimum Tax  To give companies an incentive to create manufacturing jobs\nin the U.S., the president proposes to require that companies\npay a minimum tax for profit earned overseas, a step that may\noffset the lure of low tax rates offered by some foreign\ncountries.  Companies would be banned from taking a deduction on taxes\nand would be offered a 20 percent tax credit, an amount\nsubtracted directly from taxes owed, if they brought jobs home,\naccording to the administration\u2019s fact sheet.  Obama also is proposing $6 billion in new credits over\nthree years for companies that invest in facilities or\nproduction in communities that has had major job losses.  He also again is calling for reauthorizing a measure that\nlets businesses expense the full cost of investments in\nequipment and making permanent a research and experimentation\ntax credit.  The details of the plan will be included in the fiscal 2013\nbudget Obama sends to Congress on Feb. 13.  Buffett Rule  The president repeated his State of the Union message on\ntaxes, saying that those who make $1 million or more a year\nshould pay at least a 30 percent rate.  Obama said unfairness in the  tax code  is symbolized by\n Warren Buffett \u2019s secretary, who pays a higher effective tax rate\nthan her billionaire boss. Buffett\u2019s secretary,  Debbie Bosanek ,\nwatched the State of the Union address as a guest first lady\n Michelle Obama  in the House gallery.  \u201cDoes that make any sense?\u201d Obama said in Iowa. \u201cDo we\nwant to keep these tax cuts for folks like me who don\u2019t need\nthem?\u201d  The minimum tax rate, known as the Buffett rule, was\ninspired by a New York Times op-ed essay in August in which the\nchairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. wrote that in 2010 he paid a\nlower tax rate -- 17.4 percent -- than \u201cany of the other 20\npeople in our office.\u201d  Obama plans stops this week in Colorado and  Nevada  to talk\nabout energy and  Michigan  to discuss education.
