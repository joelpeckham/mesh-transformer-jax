 "context": "The following article called 'Worst Carry Trades Show Central Banks at Stimulus Limi' was published on 2012-10-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe $4 trillion-a-day foreign-\nexchange market is losing confidence in central banks\u2019 abilities\nto boost a struggling world economy.  Rather than sparking bets on growth, the JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. G7 Volatility  Index (MXWD) , which doubled in 2008 before policy\nmakers employed extraordinary measures to address faltering\nglobal expansion, has dropped to a five-year low. While small\nforeign-exchange swings historically favor the strategy of\nborrowing in low-yielding currencies to buy those with higher\nreturns, a UBS AG  index  that tracks profits from the so-called\ncarry trade has fallen to the lowest level since 2011.  \u201cAt this stage it may feel frustrating, but waiting is not\na bad strategy,\u201d Mauricio Bouabci, a London-based currency fund\nmanager at Pareto Investment Management Ltd., which oversees $45\nbillion, said in an Oct. 17 telephone interview. It would take\nincreased volatility to tempt him back into the market, he said.  Foreign-exchange speculation is declining as mandated\nspending cuts and tax increases in the U.S. next year, concern\nthat European government leaders aren\u2019t moving fast enough to\nfix the region\u2019s debt crisis, and slowing growth in emerging\neconomies from  China  to Brazil weigh on sentiment. The world\neconomy will expand 3.3 percent this year, the least since the\n2009 recession, the International Monetary Fund said on Oct. 9.  Dwindling Volume  Average daily volume in foreign exchange fell 39 percent in\nSeptember from a year earlier, according to data from ICAP Plc\u2019s\nEBS trading platform. That\u2019s also harming currency managers\u2019\nefforts to boost returns.  The UBS V24 Carry Index surged 4.55 percent in the first\nquarter, the most since 2009, amid optimism the economic\nrecovery was gathering pace. It ended last week at 428.71, down\n7 percent from this year\u2019s high of 461.01 set on Feb. 29.  The gauge has fallen 4.8 percent from a level of 450.15 on\nAug. 9, before the Federal Reserve said it would buy $40 billion\nof mortgage debt a month until it sees improvement in the U.S.\neconomy, the European Central Bank said it would buy bonds of\nindebted members that ask for aid and the Bank of  Japan  boosted\nits asset-purchase fund to 55 trillion yen ($690 billion). The\nJPMorgan volatility index fell to 7.47 percent on Oct. 15, the\nleast since October 2007.  \u201cLow volatility is something that participants haven\u2019t\nfelt comfortable with for a while,\u201d Adrian McGowan, head of\nforeign-exchange forwards, options and trading in  Europe  at\nBarclays Plc in  London , said in an Oct. 12 interview. Investors\nhaven\u2019t been making \u201clarge\u201d bets \u201cbecause there has been so\nmuch uncertainty,\u201d he said.  Real Weakness  The dollar fell 0.6 percent against the euro last week to\n$1.3024, and rose 1.1 percent to 79.32 yen as speculation the\nBank of Japan will boost monetary stimulus sapped demand for\nthat nation\u2019s assets. The U.S. currency fell 0.3 percent to\n$1.3061 per euro and gained 0.6 percent to 79.83 yen as of 12:47\np.m. in New York.  Investing the proceeds of dollar-denominated loans should\noffer easy profits because the Fed has said it\u2019s likely to keep\nthe target rate for overnight lending between banks near zero\nthrough mid-2015. The carry trade can lose money when the\ncurrency used to fund the strategy strengthens, or the targeted\ncurrency weakens, or some combination.  Selling borrowed dollars to buy reais in  Brazil , where the\n target  interest rate is 7.25 percent, has lost about 3.4 percent\nthis year as the real tumbled, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. The IMF says Brazil will grow 1.5 percent this year,\ninstead of the 2.5 percent predicted in July.  Implied Volatility  Borrowing euros and using the proceeds to buy the New\nZealand dollar, where the official  cash rate  is 2.50 percent,\nproduced an 8.2 percent loss since Sept. 6, when the ECB\u2019s\npledge to offer Spain assistance helped trigger a slump in\nthree-month implied volatility for the pair.  \u201cCarry had such beautiful, fantastic returns -- so\nalluring, so attractive that I think people got hooked on it\nlike a drug,\u201d David Bloom, global head of currency strategy at\nHSBC Holdings Plc in London, said in a telephone interview on\nOct. 19. \u201cIn today\u2019s zero interest-rate policy world, peppered\nwith unconventional policies, it is much more difficult and\nconfusing,\u201d he wrote in an Oct. 12 research report.  Signs of strength in the global economy have emerged,\nincluding gains in jobs,  consumer confidence  and retail sales in\nthe U.S., the world\u2019s largest economy.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the Group-of-10\ncountries, which measures when data is beating or trailing the\nforecasts of analysts, climbed to a seven-month high of 18.4\nlast week, from this year\u2019s low of minus 56.2 on June 26. The\nMSCI All-Countries World Index of shares has jumped 15 percent\nfrom this year\u2019s low in June.  Smaller Margin  \u201cThere are still carry opportunities, but they are not as\nbig as they used to be so your margin of error to get in is\nsmaller,\u201d Brian Kim, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of\nScotland Group Plc\u2019s RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford \nConnecticut, said in an Oct. 17 telephone interview.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index has climbed 2\npercent this year, while the Mexican peso strengthened more than\n8 percent against its U.S. counterpart.  Doubts about the strength of the global economy flared on\nOct. 19. U.S. stocks slid the most since June as companies from\nGeneral Electric Co. to McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Microsoft Corp.\nposted earnings below analyst estimates and euro-area leaders\nfailed to discuss aid for Spain at a summit.  China Investment  Earlier in the day, China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said\n foreign direct investment  in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy,\nfell 6.8 percent in September from a year earlier to $8.43\nbillion. China\u2019s economy expanded 7.4 percent in the third\nquarter, the weakest pace in more than three years.  In reducing its forecasts for 2012 and 2013, the\nWashington-based IMF said it now sees \u201calarmingly high\u201d risks\nof a steeper global economic slowdown, with a one-in-six chance\nof growth slipping below 2 percent.  At the same time, the U.S. faces $600 billion in automatic\nspending cuts and tax increases starting Jan. 1 if Congress\ncan\u2019t agree on ways to reduce the deficit. Economic output would\nshrink by 0.5 percent next year, and  joblessness  climb to about\n9 percent if the so-called fiscal cliff isn\u2019t averted, according\nto the Congressional Budget Office.  Policy makers from  Australia  to  Sweden , who had kept\ninterest rates high as their economies grew, are lowering\nborrowing costs, reducing the allure of carry trades.  Rate Cuts  Australia\u2019s central bank cut rates five times in the past\n12 months. The Aussie\u2019s appeal to global investors has flagged,\nfalling 3 percent to $1.0311 since mid-September, as the spread\nbetween 10-year Australian and U.S. Treasury yields narrowed to\n1.42 percentage points on Oct. 19 from 2.32 percentage points a\nyear earlier.  Rates may be cut further, according to the minutes of a\nReserve Bank of Australia meeting on Oct. 2. Sweden\u2019s Riksbank\nlowered borrowing costs in September, predicting growth will\nslow to 1.5 percent this year from 3.9 percent in 2011.  Hedge funds focused on foreign-exchange trading have lost\n0.6 percent in the past three months, according to industry\nresearcher HedgeFund.net. That compares to an average gain of\n1.9 percent since June for the industry.  Trading ranges for currencies have narrowed across major\npairs. The average daily percentage change of the Australian\ndollar versus its U.S. counterpart has declined to 0.47 percent\nin 2012 from 0.68 percent last year, while for the real it has\nshrunk to 0.51 percent from 0.72 percent.  \u201cWe are likely to stay in an environment of low rates for\nlonger,\u201d Morgan Stanley currency strategists led by  Hans Redeker  in London wrote in an Oct. 18 research report. In such\nan environment, potential returns from carry trades are \u201clikely\nto be limited,\u201d they wrote.
