Vladimir Zdorovenin pleaded guilty in federal court in\n Manhattan  on Feb. 17 to a count of conspiracy and a count of\n wire fraud , records show. Federal prosecutors alleged that a\nscheme from 2004 to 2005 involving Zdorovenin, his son and\nothers preyed on U.S. consumers who believed the unauthorized\ncharges were for legitimate goods.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein, after accepting\nZdorovenin\u2019s plea, ordered that he remain in custody. He was\narrested in Zurich last March before being extradited to New\nYork. His son, Kirill, remains at large, prosecutors said.  Sabrina Shroff, a lawyer for Vladimir Zdorovenin, didn\u2019t\nimmediately return a voice-mail message today seeking comment\nabout the guilty plea.  Prosecutors alleged in an indictment that the Zdorovenins\nand unidentified accomplices controlled U.S.-registered\ncompanies Sofeco LLC, Pintado LLC and Tallit LL that appeared to\nbe legitimate Internet merchants.  The defendants both took unauthorized charges on customers\u2019\ncredit cards, prosecutors said. They also got credit card\nnumbers by either buying them from unidentified people who had\nobtained them illegally or by using computer programs that were\nsurreptitiously installed on victims\u2019 computers, the U.S.\nalleged.  Financial Services Accounts  The Zdorovenins engaged in a scheme from June 2004 to\nFebruary 2005 to access financial services accounts of U.S.\nvictims and attempted to transfer hundreds of thousands of\ndollars into bank accounts they controlled at  JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (JPM)  and a company identified in the indictment as Asia Europe\nAmerica\u2019s Bank, prosecutors said.  The defendants also maintained a financial services account\nat Ameritrade Inc. and bought and sold securities in publicly\ntraded companies through a business called Rim Investment\nManagement Ltd., prosecutors said.  The Zdorovenins were accused of committing  securities fraud \nby purchasing and selling thousands of shares of securities of\ncompanies, including  Terayon Communications Systems Inc. (TERN)  and\nInternet Capital Group Inc., by trading in the accounts of U.S.\nvictims, prosecutors said.  The Zdorovenins bought and sold securities in the same\ncompanies in their Rim account at Ameritrade, manipulating and\nearning profits they wouldn\u2019t otherwise have made, the U.S.\nsaid.  The indictment alleges that in July 2004 both Zdorovenins\nparticipated in meetings with unidentified co-conspirators in\nCyprus. Those co-conspirators transferred almost $300,000 from a\nfinancial services account of a person in the U.S. to a bank\naccount controlled by Vladimir and Kirill Zdorovenin, the\ngovernment said.
