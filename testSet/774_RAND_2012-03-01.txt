The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAdecco SA (ADEN) , the world\u2019s largest\nprovider of temporary workers, gained as much as 7 percent in\nZurich trading after raising its dividend to 1.80 Swiss francs\n($1.99) a share.  Adecco traded at 48.17 francs at 9:42 a.m. in\nZurich, 6.2 percent higher, after reporting fourth-quarter net\nincome of 133 million euros, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of\n119.3 million euros.  The larger dividend, a 64 percent increase on the previous\nyear\u2019s payout and more than the 1 franc forecast by Bloomberg,\n\u201cshould be seen in the long term because it\u2019s really a change\nin strategy,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Dominik de Daniel said in\na telephone interview.

Adecco plans to pay dividend ratios of  40\nto 50 percent of net income, compared with 25 to 30 percent\npreviously, he said.

(MAN)  added 20 percent in the same period and  Randstad\nHolding NV (RAND)  increased 27 percent.
