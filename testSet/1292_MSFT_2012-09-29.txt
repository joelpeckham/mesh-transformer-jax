The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc.\u2019s map-software\nshortcomings -- though vexing for many iPhone owners -- have\nbeen a boon for makers of competing mobile-navigation tools.  AOL Inc. (AOL) \u2019s MapQuest leaped into the top 20 on Apple\u2019s  App\nStore , while start-up Waze Inc. said its downloads hit a record\ntoday after Apple Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  suggested\nthat customers frustrated with his company\u2019s iPhone mapping\nsoftware try services from a competitor. Apple also opened a\nnavigation category within the online App Store.  The boost came after Cook issued a public apology for\ninadequacies with mapping software introduced last week. The\ntool has been widely faulted for unreliable landmark searches,\nroutes that get users lost and a lack of public transit\ndirections. The new mapping replaces  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s service,\nwhich had been Apple\u2019s default navigation tool since the iPhone\nwas introduced in 2007.  \u201cThis is going to be our biggest day ever,\u201d Noam Bardin,\nCEO of  Palo Alto , California-based Waze, said in an interview.\n\u201cI can\u2019t even predict where it\u2019s going to end.\u201d  Cook singled out Waze, MapQuest and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) \u2019s Bing\nas alternatives to Apple\u2019s mapping application that can be\ndownloaded from Apple\u2019s App Store. He also said mapping services\nfrom Google and  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  could be used from the iPhone\u2019s web\nbrowser.  \u201cAt Apple, we strive to make world-class products that\ndeliver the best experience possible to our customers,\u201d Cook\nsaid in a statement posted on the company\u2019s website. \u201cWith the\nlaunch of our new Maps last week, we fell short on this\ncommitment.\u201d  Google\u2019s Headstart  Microsoft said it didn\u2019t yet have data to report on the\nnumber of Bing downloads.  Since introducing the mapping application last week as part\nof a mobile-software upgrade, Apple has been learning how\ndifficult a service navigation is to provide, Bardin said.\nGoogle and Nokia are two of the biggest mapping companies, along\nwith  TomTom NV (TOM2) , from which Apple is licensing data.  Apple introduced the new feature to replace Google, a\nbusiness rival that makes the competing Android operating system\nused by companies including Samsung Electronics Co.  Google started its mapping service in 2005 with mixed\nresults. Yet it grew to become one of the industry leaders by\ninvesting heavily and sending out cars loaded with Global\nPositioning System sensors and other technology to map the\nworld.  User Help  To catch up, Apple will rely on the millions of iPhone and\niPad owners. Cook said that more than 100 million people are\nusing the company\u2019s new iOS 6 mobile operating system with the\nnew mapping software. As more people use the service, data will\nbe accumulated that can help improve it, he said. The\napplication has a feature for customers to tell Apple when\nthere\u2019s a bad location or other bug.  Bardin of Waze said he was thrilled to be mentioned in\nCook\u2019s apology letter. His company offers a free crowd-sourced\nnavigation tool, so that any time somebody uses the service they\nare passively sending GPS data back to the company that is used\nto build better maps. It can alert drivers to traffic and divert\nthem to different routes, based on data being sent from\nsmartphone owners up the road.  \u201cThe more people who use my service the better it is,\u201d\nsaid Bardin, whose company is funded by investors including\nKleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The company plans to make\nmoney eventually by selling location-based advertisements.  Apple is being held back because the underlying data it\u2019s\nlicensing isn\u2019t good enough, Bardin said. While the quality will\nimprove, it will be very expensive to match the sum Google has\nalready spent on maps, he said.  \u201cThe tactical challenge is they bit off what Google does\nreally well,\u201d he said, \u201cand tried to do it themselves.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAdam Satariano in  San Francisco  at \n asatariano1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTom Giles at \n tgiles5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Microsoft Corporation was 24.567333221435547 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Microsoft Corporation was ",
