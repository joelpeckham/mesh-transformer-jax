 "context": "The following article called 'FTC Said to Ready to Back Hertz-Dollar Thrifty Deal' was published on 2012-11-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission is\nprepared to approve  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) \u2019s $2.6 billion\nacquisition of  Dollar Thrifty  Automotive Group Inc. after the\ncompany agreed to shed more airport locations than it initially\noffered, four people familiar with the deal said.  To win antitrust clearance, Hertz said it would divest\nabout 15 additional airport outlets including at Cleveland and\n Detroit , said the people, who asked not to be identified because\nthe talks aren\u2019t public. It isn\u2019t known whether the agency\u2019s\ncommissioners have taken a final vote, two of the people said.  A draft statement announcing the approval is being\ncirculated among the agency\u2019s commissioners, one of the people\nsaid. Cecelia Prewett, a spokeswoman for the FTC, declined to\ncomment on progress of the agency\u2019s antitrust review of the\ndeal.  Once completed, the transaction would bolster Hertz\u2019s\nposition as the No. 2 player in the U.S. rental-car market,\nenabling it to better compete with the industry leader,\nEnterprise Holdings Inc.  The Dollar Thrifty acquisition, led by Chief Executive\nOfficer Mark Frissora, may be the last combination of major U.S.\ncar rental companies that can win regulatory approval.  Market Share  Together, Hertz, Enterprise Rent-A-Car and  Avis Budget\nGroup Inc. (CAR)  control about 75 percent of car rentals, with Dollar\nThrifty holding 5 percent, according to a February report from\nIBISWorld. No other competitor has more than 1 percent of the\n$30.5 billion market in the U.S. this year, according to\nIBISWorld, the Santa Monica, California-based industry\nresearcher.  Hertz, with 8,750 outlets worldwide, has more than 3,900\nU.S. locations, while Dollar Thrifty has about 280 corporate-\nowned outlets in the U.S. and  Canada .  The $87.50-a-share offer represents an 8 percent premium to\nDollar Thrifty\u2019s closing price of  $81 (DTG)  on Aug. 24. The price is\nmore than twice the $41-a-share Hertz offered in April 2010.  Formal Bid  Hertz began its pursuit of Dollar Thrifty in April 2007 and\nmade a formal bid in 2010 of about $1.2 billion that  Dollar\nThrifty shareholders  rejected. Park Ridge, New Jersey-based\nHertz made another offer last year that it later withdrew,\nciting market conditions.  Hertz agreed to sell its Advantage brand to  Franchise\nServices of North America Inc . and  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) \u2019s\nMacquarie Capital. The purchase price was $16 million, one\nperson with knowledge of the situation has said. The sale is\ndependent upon Hertz completing the acquisition of Tulsa,\nOklahoma-based Dollar Thrifty.  Franchise Services, which operates the U-Save brand, is run\nby Co-Chief Executive Officer Sanford Miller, the CEO of Budget\nGroup Inc. from 1997 to 2004.  Richard Broome, a Hertz spokesman, declined to comment.  Hertz and Dollar Thrifty said the transaction is a two-step\nprocess starting with a cash tender offer for all outstanding\nshares of Dollar Thrifty followed by a cash merger to acquire\nany remaining shares of common stock.
