The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCharles Dallara , managing director\nof the  Institute of International Finance , said he\u2019s hopeful of\nfinding \u201ccommon ground\u201d on a Greek debt swap as European\nfinance ministers pushed for greater concessions from the\ncountry\u2019s private creditors.  \u201cWe put an offer on the table and it remains on the\ntable,\u201d Dallara, who\u2019s negotiating with Greece on behalf of\nprivate bondholders, said in a Bloomberg Television interview\ntoday. \u201cAll parties need to contribute to the solution. We are\nwiping off the face of the earth 100 billion euros ($130\nbillion) of claims against Greece.\u201d  European finance ministers meeting in Brussels signaled\nthey would push Greece\u2019s private investors to accept bigger\nlosses after Dallara made what he described as the bondholders\u2019\n\u201cmaximum\u201d offer. Euro area governments are seeking to fill a\ndeeper-than-expected hole in Greece\u2019s finances by saddling\ninvestors with a lower  interest rate  on exchanged bonds, setting\nup a confrontation before a European Union summit on Jan. 30.  Brinkmanship over Greece clouded progress toward new fiscal\nrules and a beefed-up rescue fund, posing a potential setback to\nthe start-of-year rally in stocks, bonds and the euro. A\nBloomberg index of European  financial shares  posted its biggest\ndecline in two weeks.  More to Do  \u201cObviously Greece and the banks have to do more in order\nto reach a sustainable debt level,\u201d Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  told reporters in Brussels before the final\nsession of a two-day meeting of European ministers.  European officials and the nation\u2019s private bondholders\nagreed in October to implement a 50 percent cut in the face\nvalue of more than 200 billion euros of Greek debt by\nvoluntarily exchanging outstanding bonds for new securities,\nwith a goal of reducing  Greece \u2019s borrowings to 120 percent of\ngross domestic product by 2020. The accord is key to a second\nfinancing package for the cash-strapped country, which faces a\n14.5 billion-euro bond payment on March 20.  The latest proposal from the IIF would lead to a loss of\nabout 69 percent on the net-present value of Greek bonds, two\npeople with knowledge of the talks said. Under the proposal, the\nnew 30-year bonds would carry a coupon of about 4.25 percent,\nsaid the people, who declined to be identified because the talks\nare private.  Finance chiefs are pushing for coupons below 3.5 percent\nfor debt to be serviced until 2020 and below 4 percent over the\n30 years of the next Greek package.  Paris Meeting  Dallara said he would consult with Greece\u2019s creditors in a\nmeeting in Paris tomorrow \u201cto see what their thinking is.\u201d He\nand  Jean Lemierre , a special adviser to the chairman of  BNP\nParibas (BNP)  SA, are leading talks for the bondholders.  There\u2019s a lot riding on resolving the crisis cooperatively,\nDallara said at a press conference in Zurich, adding that he\nhasn\u2019t yet received a \u201cformal\u201d response from official parties\nto the bondholders\u2019 latest offer.  Private investors hold only about 60 percent of Greek debt,\nand all parties, public and private, need to contribute to\nreducing Greece\u2019s debt, Dallara said. The  European Central Bank \nhas said it won\u2019t participate in the debt swap.  \u201cIt is important for all parties to recognize how much we\nall have at stake here and work together and co-operatively to\nfind a solution,\u201d Dallara told reporters. \u201cSome might minimize\nthe risk of an involuntary debt exchange and point to other\ncases such as  Argentina . I would caution against that\nattitude.\u201d  \u2018Psychological Impact\u2019  The difference between the losses bondholders have offered\nand those mentioned by EU finance chiefs \u201ccomes down to 10\nbillion or 20 billion euros\u201d over the life of the new bonds,\nsaid  Carsten Brzeski , an economist at ING Group in Brussels.  \u201cThis is just nothing compared to the psychological impact\nyou would get on Spanish or Italian yields if Greece were to go\nbust,\u201d Brzeski said in an interview today. \u201cThey\u2019re going to\nfind a deal,\u201d he said on Bloomberg Television.  The contribution of euro governments and the  International\nMonetary Fund  to the package will stay at 130 billion euros as\npledged in October.  \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the Greek program is off track,\u201d\nLuxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told reporters\nafter chairing last night\u2019s meeting of ministers from the 17\neuro countries.  The stalemate is reminiscent of October\u2019s bargaining over\nbond losses and threatens to spill into next week\u2019s leaders\u2019\nsummit.
