 "context": "The following article called 'Oil Rises in New York on Forecast of U.S. Fuel Supply Drop, Jobs Increase' was published on 2012-03-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOil climbed from the lowest price in\nmore than two weeks in  New York  on forecasts that gasoline\nsupplies are falling and employment increasing in the U.S., the\nworld\u2019s biggest consumer of crude.  Futures gained as much as 0.9 percent before government\ndata today that may show motor-fuel inventories slipped by 1.6\nmillion barrels last week. Stockpiles decreased  2.25 million\nbarrels , the most since November, the industry-funded American\nPetroleum Institute said yesterday. U.S. employers probably\nadded 210,000 jobs in February after gaining 243,000 in January,\naccording to a Bloomberg survey before a March 9 report.  \u201cU.S. economic figures have been surprisingly good, and\nthis of course helps commodities,\u201d said  Hannes Loacker , an\nanalyst at  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  in Vienna who\npredicts U.S. crude will average $104 a barrel this quarter.\n\u201cSo hopefully this will continue.\u201d  Oil for April delivery rose as much as 90 cents to $105.60\na barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile\nExchange  and was at $105.08 at 1:10 p.m. London time. The\ncontract yesterday fell $2.02 to $104.70 a barrel, the lowest\nclose since Feb. 17. Prices are 6.3 percent higher this year.  Brent oil for April settlement increased 0.5 percent to\n$122.59 on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The\nEuropean benchmark contract\u2019s  premium  to New York-traded West\nTexas Intermediate was at $17.51, up from $17.28 yesterday. It\nreached a record of $27.88 on Oct. 14.  Iran Tension  Prices rose even as  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  resumed service on a U.S.\ncrude pipeline earlier than it expected. The company started one\nof two Illinois oil lines shut because of an accident, Lorraine\nLittle, a spokeswoman for Calgary-based Enbridge, said in an e-\nmailed statement.  Oil has climbed this year amid concern European and U.S.\nsanctions against Iran will lead to military conflict in the\n Persian Gulf , home to more than half the world\u2019s oil.  The European Union has offered to negotiate with Iran on\nbehalf of  China , France,  Germany ,  Russia , the U.K. and the U.S.,\nafter President Barack Obama called for more time to let\ndiplomacy and sanctions solve the standoff. Israeli Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu this week said he won\u2019t allow his\nnation to be threatened by an Iranian nuclear bomb.  Demand Side \u2018Cloudy\u2019  \u201cWhy is Brent trading above $120? It\u2019s geopolitics,\u201d said\nRaiffeisen\u2019s Loacker. \u201cThe demand side is still rather cloudy,\nespecially in Europe but also the U.S. substantially weaker than\nlast year. The supply side is rather bullish, with production\noutages in Yemen, Syria, South Sudan and still the question of\nhow much of  Iran \u2019s exports are being sold these days.\u201d  U.S. crude  stockpiles  rose 4.6 million barrels last week to\nthe highest level in more than five months, according to the\nAmerican Petroleum Institute. A report from the Energy\nDepartment today may show inventories gained 1.5 million\nbarrels, according to the median of 10 analyst estimates in a\nBloomberg News survey.  The API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis\nfrom operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The\ngovernment requires that reports be filed with the Energy\nDepartment for its weekly survey.  Demand in the U.S. remains weak and speculation resulting\nfrom U.S. and European sanctions on Iran has pushed prices above\nlevels warranted by demand, Fereidun Fesharaki, chairman of\nFacts  Global Energy Inc. (GEYI)  and a former energy adviser to the\nIranian government, said in an interview in Singapore today.  \u201cThis year has been one of unprecedented supply increases\nin the  Middle East , and demand is the weakest in 15 years\nexcluding 2009,\u201d said Fesharaki, who sees Brent oil falling to\n$110 a barrel in the next two months. \u201cReally, the sanctions\ndon\u2019t work. They just create tensions in the market and push\nprices higher than they ought to be,\u201d he said earlier during an\ninterview with Bloomberg Television.
