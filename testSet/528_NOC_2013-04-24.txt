 "context": "The following article called 'Democrat Seeks Transparency on Drones as White House Skip' was published on 2013-04-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSenator  Richard Durbin  faulted the\nObama administration for failing to participate in what he\ndescribed as the Senate\u2019s first hearing on the use of unmanned\naircraft for targeted killings of suspected terrorists.  Durbin of  Illinois , the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, called on\nthe administration yesterday to provide greater transparency\nabout its use of armed drones as the White House declined to\nprovide a witness for a hearing on the issue.  \u201cI do want to note for the record my disappointment that\nthe administration declined to provide witnesses to testify at\ntoday\u2019s hearings,\u201d Durbin said at a hearing by the Senate\nJudiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution,  Civil Rights  and\n Human Rights , which he heads.  \u201cIn my view, more transparency is needed to maintain the\nsupport of the American people and our international\ncommunity,\u201d Durbin said.  President  Barack Obama \u2019s administration should provide more\ninformation \u201cabout its analysis of its legal authority to\nengage in targeted killings and the internal checks and balances\ninvolved in U.S. drone strikes,\u201d Durbin said.  The White House has \u201cbeen in regular contact with the\ncommittee about how we can best provide them the information\nthey require,\u201d Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National\nSecurity Council, said today in an e-mail.  Pressure has been building in Congress for the White House\nto lay out the legal foundation and rules that apply in\nconducting drone strikes, particularly against Americans\nsuspected of terrorism overseas.  Paul Filibuster  Senator  Rand Paul , a Kentucky Republican, made headlines\nlast month by staging a 13-hour filibuster delaying the\nconfirmation of  John Brennan  to be CIA director to win a pledge\nfrom the administration that it wouldn\u2019t use drones to target\nAmericans on U.S. soil without an imminent threat. As Obama\u2019s\nformer counterterrorism adviser, Brennan had been the architect\nand manager of drone policy.  Obama pledged in his  State of the Union  address in February\nto provide more information on drone policy.  \u201cI recognize that, in our democracy, no one should just\ntake my word for it that we\u2019re doing things the right way,\u201d\nObama said. \u201cSo, in the months ahead, I will continue to engage\nCongress to ensure not only that our targeting, detention and\nprosecution of terrorists remains consistent with our laws and\nsystem of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even\nmore transparent to the American people and to the world.\u201d  \u2018Drastic Expansion\u2019  The panel\u2019s top Republican, Senator  Ted Cruz  of  Texas , said\nhe was disappointed by the absence of an administration\nparticipant at the hearing, particularly because the session had\nbeen postponed a week to give the White House more time to\nproduce one. Cruz accused Obama of seeking a \u201cdrastic expansion\nof federal power\u201d in his use of targeted killings.  Retired Marine General James Cartwright, a former vice\nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in prepared remarks\nfor the hearing that the administration should create an\ninteragency task force to evaluate covert drone operations,\nwhile encouraging the Defense Department and Central\nIntelligence Agency to establish a process for declassifying\nthose operations once they are completed.  \u201cI am worried that we have lost the moral high ground,\u201d\nCartwright said at the hearing. \u201cThe current drone policy has\nleft us in a position where we are causing more problems than\nwe\u2019re solving.\u201d  While drones, made by companies such as General Atomics, of\nSan Diego, and  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , of  Falls Church ,\nVirginia, have been effective in killing suspected terrorists in\nplaces such as Pakistan and  Yemen , they have drawn criticism for\ncausing civilian casualties.  Yemeni Activist  Farea Al-Muslimi, a Yemeni youth activist and freelance\njournalist who studied in the U.S. for a year in high school,\ntold the subcommittee his village in Yemen was struck by a U.S.\ndrone about a week ago.  \u201cThere is now an intense anger at Americans,\u201d Al-Muslimi\nsaid of his village. \u201cThe drone strikes are the face of America\nto many Yemenis.\u201d  Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University\nSchool of Law in Arlington, Virginia, said Congress should\nconsider creating a specialized court to approve the targeting\nof U.S. citizens, similar to the court used to authorize\nintelligence surveillance warrants.  That proposal drew a rebuke from Republican  Senator Lindsey Graham  of South Carolina, who said it would amount to a\n\u201cbreathtaking overstepping\u201d by unelected judges over military\noperations.  Rosa Brooks, a law professor at the  Georgetown University\nLaw Center  in  Washington , said the U.S. will pave the way for\nother governments to begin using drone strikes inappropriately\nunless it develops a clear set of rules to guide the policy.  Without clear rules and safeguards, \u201cwe\u2019ve essentially\nhanded a playbook for abuse to oppressive governments around the\nworld,\u201d Brooks said.
