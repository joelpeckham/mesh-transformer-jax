 "context": "The following article called 'American Superconductor Rises on Talk Suit May Be Resolved' was published on 2012-01-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmerican Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , the\nmaker of wind-turbine parts suing its former largest customer,\nsurged for the third time in four days as investors covered\nshort positions amid speculation that the case may be resolved.  AMSC rose 7.4 percent to $5.64 at the close in New York.\nThe shares jumped 28 percent Jan. 18 and have increased 53\npercent since the beginning of the month.  \u201cA lot of rumors are swirling about the arbitration\ncase,\u201d said Carter Driscoll, a Capstone Investments analyst in\nMiami who rates AMSC shares a \u201chold.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure there was\nsome massive short covering the other day in anticipation of\nthat.\u201d  AMSC says Beijing-based Sinovel Wind Group Co. broke\ncontracts and stole its intellectual property. Sinovel denies\nthe charges and maintains AMSC\u2019s parts weren\u2019t meeting its\nstandards.  The case is due to be heard in  China  \u201cearly this year,\u201d\nsaid Jason Fredette, a spokesman for Devens, Massachusetts-based\nAMSC. He declined to comment on the reason for the share move.  Short sellers borrow stock hoping to profit once the shares\ndecline and usually have to pay interest while their positions\nare open. They eventually have to buy shares to cover their\npositions. Most Chinese offices will be closed the week of Jan.\n23 for the Lunar New Year holiday.  \u201cWhen you get those big, 20-plus-percent moves without any\nfundamental moves, it generally is short covering,\u201d Driscoll\nsaid.  The Beijing Arbitration Commission called off a hearing\nabout the matter earlier this month, according to a report in\nthe China Securities Journal on Jan. 10 that cited people from\nthe commission and Sinovel it didn\u2019t identify.  A former AMSC employee in Austria pleaded guilty there in\nSeptember to charges including economic espionage after being\naccused of passing software and source code to Sinovel, which is\nChina\u2019s second-biggest wind turbine maker.
