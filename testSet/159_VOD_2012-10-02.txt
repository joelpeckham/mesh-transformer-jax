The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTelefonica SA (TEF) , Spain\u2019s biggest phone\ncompany, plans to file with regulators as early as today its\nintention to sell shares in the O2 Germany unit, two people with\nknowledge of the matter said.  Telefonica is seeking 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) to 1.5\nbillion euros from an initial public offering of the business,\nthe people said, asking not to be identified because the\ndeliberations are private. At the high end of the range, the\nstock sale would be the biggest in Germany since engine maker\n Tognum AG (TGM)  raised 1.8 billion euros in 2007.  A listing of O2 Germany could happen as early as this\nmonth, and Madrid-based Telefonica will start gauging investor\ninterest this week, people familiar with the matter have said.\nTelefonica Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta plans to use\nhigh dividends to attract investors, the people said last week.  Faced with declining profit and more intense competition at\nits domestic market, Telefonica is selling assets, including\nstakes in its German and Latin American businesses, to help pare\nmore than 58 billion euros of debt. In July, Telefonica decided\nto scrap a 1.50 euro-a-share dividend for 2012, and will resume\npaying half of the amount starting in the fourth quarter of\n2013.  With phone companies from the Netherlands to France cutting\ndividends to preserve cash, Telefonica is betting a minimum of\n500 million euros in O2 Germany dividends next year will offset\nthe unit\u2019s small size in Germany, where mobile accounts\noutnumber people, people familiar with the matter said last\nweek. O2 and Royal  KPN NV (KPN) \u2019s E-Plus unit vie for the position of\nthe third-largest wireless company in Germany, where  Vodafone\nGroup Plc (VOD)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  are the leaders.  Telefonica shares rose 1.2 percent to 10.54 euros at the\nclose of trading in  Madrid  yesterday, valuing the company at 48\nbillion euros. The stock has fallen 21 percent this year, while\nthe Bloomberg Europe Telecommunication Services  Index (BETELES)  is down\n3.6 percent. O2 Germany would have a market value of about 7.5\nbillion euros based on the high end of the IPO target.
