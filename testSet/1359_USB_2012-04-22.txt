 "context": "The following article called 'Pakistan\u2019s Unplanned Revolution Rewrites Its Future' was published on 2012-04-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nReturning last week from an\ninstructive three weeks in  Pakistan , I was detained briefly at\nIslamabad\u2019s chaotic airport after an X-ray machine showed two\nhighly suspicious music CDs and a USB memory stick in my check-\nin bag.  The music was of  Mehdi Hassan , my favorite singer in South\n Asia , and the USB was part of a PR packet given to me by a\nBangkok hotelier. It didn\u2019t matter. For nearly three hours, two\nmen in shalwar kameez -- members of one of Pakistan\u2019s\nintelligence agencies -- supervised customs and immigration\nofficials, and even the staff of my Middle Eastern airline,\nthrough an extensive scrutiny of my bags and the many visas in\nmy passport.  These plainclothed, thuggish-looking men seemed to confirm\nthe popular Western stereotype of Pakistan\u2019s \u201cdeep state,\u201d a\nvast subterranean network of soldiers, spies, and militants-for-\nhire that actually runs the country while the state fails to\nprovide health care and education to a largely poor and\nilliterate population of nearly 190 million.  An Invisible Tumult  I had last visited Pakistan in 2009, just as a  near-\nhysterical Western media  was trumpeting that the Taliban was\nonly 60 miles from Islamabad. In the years since then, the\nTaliban has plainly failed to overrun Pakistan. Still, Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of the banned terrorist group\nLashkar-e-Taiba, on whom the U.S. government recently placed a\nbounty of $10 million, remains depressingly ubiquitous. His\ndefiant and widely reported speeches could seem further proof\nof, if not rampant Talibanization, then the indispensability of\nextremists to Pakistan\u2019s ruling classes.  However, I also saw much in this recent visit that did not\nconform to the main Western narrative for  South Asia  -- one in\nwhich  India  is steadily rising and Pakistan rapidly collapsing.  Born of certain geopolitical needs and exigencies, this\nvision was always most useful to those who have built up India\nas an investment destination and a strategic counterweight to\n China , and who have sought to bribe and cajole Pakistan\u2019s\nmilitary-intelligence establishment into the war on terrorism.  Seen through the narrow lens of the West\u2019s security and\neconomic interests, the great internal contradictions and tumult\nwithin these two large nation-states disappear. In the Western\nview, the credit-fueled consumerism among the Indian middle\nclass appears a much bigger phenomenon than the extraordinary\nMaoist uprising in Central India.  Likewise, a bloody anti-state insurgency has raged in\nPakistan\u2019s resource-rich Balochistan province for much of the\nprevious decade; it has merited little attention since Western\nmilitary objectives have been more directly at stake in other\nparts of Pakistan.  Traveling through Pakistan, I realized how much my own\nknowledge of the country -- its problems as well as prospects --\nwas partial, defective or simply useless. Certainly, truisms\nabout the general state of crisis were not hard to corroborate.\nCriminal gangs shot rocket-propelled grenades at each other and\nthe police in Karachi\u2019s Lyari neighborhood. Shiite Hazaras were\nbeing assassinated in Balochistan every day. Street riots broke\nout in several places over severe power shortages -- indeed, the\none sound that seemed to unite the country was the groan of\ndiesel generators, helping the more affluent Pakistanis cope\nwith early summer heat.  Gangsters with Kalashnikovs  In this eternally air-conditioned Pakistan, meanwhile,\nthere exist fashion shows, rock bands, literary festivals,\ninternationally prominent writers, Oscar-winning filmmakers and\nthe bold anchors of a lively new electronic media. This is the\nglamorously liberal country upheld by English-speaking\nPakistanis fretting about their national image in the West (some\nof them might have been gratified by the runaway success of\nHello magazine\u2019s first Pakistani edition last week).  But much less conspicuous and more significant, other signs\nof a society in rapid socioeconomic and political transition\nabounded. The elected parliament is about to complete its five-\nyear term -- a rare event in Pakistan -- and its amendments to\nthe constitution have taken away some if not all of the near-\ndespotic prerogatives of the president\u2019s office.  Political parties are scrambling to take advantage of the\nstrengthening ethno-linguistic movements for provincial autonomy\nin Punjab and Sindh provinces. Young men and women, poor as well\nas upper middle class, have suddenly buoyed the anti-corruption\ncampaign led by  Imran Khan , an ex-cricketer turned politician.  After radically increasing the size of the consumerist\nmiddle class to 30 million, Pakistan\u2019s formal economy, which\ngrew only 2.4 percent in 2011, currently presents a dismal\npicture. But the informal sector of the economy, which spreads\nacross rural and urban areas, is creating what the architect and\nsocial scientist Arif Hasan  calls  Pakistan\u2019s \u201cunplanned\nrevolution.\u201d Karachi, where a mall of Dubai-grossness recently\nerupted near the city\u2019s main beach, now boasts \u201ca first world\neconomy and sociology, but with a third world wage and political\nstructure.\u201d  Even in Lyari, Karachi\u2019s diseased old heart, where young\ngangsters with Kalashnikovs lurked in the alleys, billboards\nvended quick proficiency in  information technology  and the\nEnglish language. Everywhere, in the Salt Range in northwestern\nPunjab as well as the long corridor between Lahore and\nIslamabad, were gated housing colonies, private colleges, fast-\nfood restaurants and other markers of Pakistan\u2019s breakneck\nsuburbanization.  None of these developments conform to a clear pattern of\nlinear movement -- ascent to greatness or descent into chaos --\npopularized by recent accounts of South Asia, which rest on\nsimple-minded notions about Europe and the U.S.\u2019s deeply\ntraumatic experience of nation-building.  The unplanned revolution can come grievously unstuck if\nPakistan\u2019s economy fails to generate enough jobs for the\ncountry\u2019s overwhelmingly youthful population. The few unbiased\ncommentators on Pakistan\u2019s new television channels seem\noutnumbered by the crazed zealots peddling visions of Hindu and\nJewish malevolence. A campaign against corruption in public life\nmay alert millions of young Pakistanis to the possibility of\nparticipatory democracy; it may also turn them into foot\nsoldiers of an anti-political and authoritarian populism.  Clearly, Pakistan won\u2019t easily escape the consequences of\nthe delusions and follies of its security establishment and its\nforeign patrons. The suicide attacks that killed thousands of\nPakistanis in recent years have decreased. But the army, though\noverstretched and exhausted by the war on terrorism and\nincreasingly challenged by politicians and the news media, still\nseems far from giving up its proprietary rights over Pakistan\u2019s\npolitics and economy.  Old habits will die hard -- as indicated by the\nintelligence agents trying to decipher my notebook. But they may\ngrow obsolete and futile first: Mechanically sifting through my\nfaded credit card receipts and weeks-old laundry, the spooks\nconveyed little conviction or even ordinary efficiency. When I\nconfronted one of them, demanding to know his name and\nemployers, he scurried away.  His \u201cdeep state\u201d seemed a bit shallow then. In any case, as\n Indonesia ,  Turkey  and, most recently,  Egypt  and  Tunisia  have\nproved, deep states, however cannily structured, can no longer\nbottle up political pressures created by globalized economies,\nmodern communications and raised expectations.  Sustained by powerful Pakistanis, demagogues such as Hafiz\nSaeed and many other plump-cheeked professional jihadis and\nanti-Shiite bigots will continue to present a disagreeable face\nof Pakistan to the world. But their frenetic attempts at\npolitical alliance-building reveal that they, too, are\nstruggling to stay relevant in a rapidly changing society.  Foreign policy makers and commentators -- especially those\nfor whom the Taliban are forever 60 miles away from Islamabad --\nwould do well to recognize this ferment of Pakistan, even if\nthey can\u2019t yet assess its scale and complexity.
