 "context": "The following article called 'Sumitomo, Tokyo Gas Secure U.S. LNG From Dominion for Japan' was published on 2012-04-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSumitomo Corp. (8053) , Japan\u2019s third-\nlargest trading house, and  Tokyo Gas Co. (9531)  secured a supply\ncontract from the U.S., where natural gas trades for a fraction\nof the price in Asia.  Sumitomo and Tokyo Gas agreed to buy 2.3 million metric\ntons of liquefied natural gas annually for 20 years from\n Dominion Resources Inc. (D) \u2019s Cove Point project, the trading house\nsaid today in a statement. Dominion, which needs U.S. approval\nto sell to Japan, plans to build and start operating the Cove\nPoint plant in 2017. Dominion, based in Richmond, Virginia, will\nliquefy the gas from Sumitomo\u2019s assets in the northeast of the\nU.S.  \u201cIf the project is finally agreed, Sumitomo will be able\nto establish a natural gas and LNG value chain in the U.S.\u201d\nstretching from extraction to export, Sumitomo said.  Japanese traders, led by  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) \u2019s $6 billion\noutlay on an  Encana Corp. (ECA)  shale project announced in February,\nare stepping up purchases of U.S. and Canadian natural gas\nassets as they seek to export the fuel in the form of LNG to\nAsia. The 40-year-old oil-linked price mechanism for Asian LNG\nmeans buyers in the region, which accounts for more than 60\npercent of global demand, are paying nine times more for gas\nthan U.S. domestic users.  Nuclear Meltdown  U.S. Henry Hub futures rose 4.8 percent to $2.134 per\nmillion British thermal units as of 12:29 a.m. in  New York .\nJapan, which has just one of its 54 nuclear reactors in\noperation since a March 2011 meltdown at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi\nplant, paid about $18.85 per million Btu in the first 11 months\nof last year, according to  finance ministry  data.  At current U.S. prices, the Japanese partners will be able\nto sell their contracted LNG in the domestic market at less than\n$10 per million Btu, Kunio Nohata, senior general manager at\nTokyo Gas, told reporters in Tokyo today.  Sumitomo was among the first Japanese traders to invest in\nU.S. shale with the 2009 purchase of a 12.5 percent stake in the\nBarnett Shale Gas project in Texas from  Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. (CRZO) \nTogether with its stake in  Rex Energy Corp. (REXX) \u2019s Marcellus shale\narea, the trader has a 140 million cubic feet per day supply of\ngas, JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. said in a March 19 report.  \u201cFor the trading companies the areas for new acquisitions\nare food, base metals like copper, and especially shale gas and\noil,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Akira Kishimoto said yesterday in Tokyo,\nbefore the Sumitomo announcement. LNG exports from  North America \nmay become one of the main businesses of Japanese trading\ncompanies in about five years, he said.  Import Terminal  Sumitomo, which also owns U.S. gas trader Pacific Summit\nEnergy LLC, said the Cove Point LNG will be destined for  Japan .\nCove Point currently acts as an LNG import terminal, operated by\nDominion.  The feed for Dominion\u2019s Cove Point LNG, also in the\nnortheast of the U.S., will come from the Marcellus shale\nproject, Sumitomo said. The LNG plant Dominion plans to build\nwill have an annual 5-million-ton capacity, it said.  Japan\u2019s imports of spot LNG surged 20 percent to a record\nin February, with supplies from Nigeria providing more than half\nof the total as the country seeks fuels to replace power from\nnuclear plants that have been shut, customs data showed. Imports\nunder immediate and short-term contracts rose to 1.18 million\ntons, according to data from the finance ministry.  Japan\u2019s total LNG imports, which include long-term\ncontracted shipments, rose 22.5 percent in February from a year\nearlier to 7.67 million tons, according to the finance ministry.
