 "context": "The following article called 'Treasury Bonds Advance After Weak Auction Lures Buyers' was published on 2012-10-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTreasury 30-year bonds advanced for\na third day as investors took advantage of a spike in yields\nafter a weak $13 billion auction of the securities, underscoring\nthe insatiable appeal of the world\u2019s safest assets.  The longest-maturity U.S. security drew a yield of 2.904\npercent, compared with a forecast of 2.880 percent in a\nBloomberg News survey of eight of the  Federal Reserve \u2019s primary\ndealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by\ncomparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was\n2.49, versus an average of 2.65 for the previous 10 sales.\nYields rose earlier as global stocks climbed for the first time\nthis week and commodities rallied as investors sought higher\nreturns after U.S. jobless claims slid to a four-year low.  \u201cWe saw too much of a concession and the investors are\nbuying the rise in yields,\u201d said  Suvrat Prakash , an interest-\nrate strategist in  New York  at BNP Paribas SA, which as a\nprimary dealer is required to bid at U.S. debt auctions.\n\u201cPeople are still comfortable being long, given the global\neconomic backdrop. We still have a lot of questions and\nuncertainty to wade through, which means less growth and less\nprobability of a rate market selloff.\u201d  The 30-year bond yield fell three basis points, or 0.03\npercentage point, to 2.85 percent at 5 p.m. New York time, after\nrising to 2.93 percent. The 2.75 percent security due August\n2042 rose 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 dollar face amount, to 97 30/32.\nTen-year note yields were little changed at 1.67 percent.  \u2018Treading Water\u2019  The Fed will buy as much as $2.25 billion of Treasuries\nmaturing from February 2036 to August 2042 tomorrow, according\nto the Fed Bank of New York\u2019s  website . The central bank is in\nthe process of swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings\nwith those due in six to 30 years to put downward pressure on\nlong-term  interest rates .  \u201cThere is still a lot of uncertainty, so it keeps the\nmarket from selling off significantly,\u201d said  Kevin Flanagan ,\nthe Purchase, New York-based chief fixed-income strategist at\nMorgan Stanley Smith Barney, the world\u2019s largest brokerage, with\nassets of $1.78 trillion. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to levels where the\nmarket feels skittish, and so we are just treading water.\u201d  Today\u2019s bond auction was the last of three sales of coupon-\nbearing securities by the Treasury this week totaling $66\nbillion. The U.S. sold $21 billion of 10-year debt yesterday at\na yield of 1.7 percent and auctioned $32 billion of three-year\nnotes on Sept. 11 at a yield of 0.346 percent.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign\ncentral banks, purchased 26.5 percent of the bonds, the lowest\nsince August 2011 and compared with 38.7 percent of the notes at\nthe September sale and an average for the past 10 offerings of\n33.2 percent.  Jobless Claims  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place\ntheir bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.2 percent of\nthe bonds, compared with 12.4 percent of the notes at the last\nsale and an average of 15.1 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 2.5 percent this year,\ncompared with a 2 percent gain in the broader U.S. Treasuries\nmarket, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Applications for  jobless benefits  dropped 30,000 to 339,000\nin the week ended Oct. 6, the fewest since February 2008, Labor\nDepartment figures showed today. Economists forecast 370,000\nclaims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.\nOne state accounted for most of the plunge in claims, a Labor\nDepartment spokesman said as the data were issued to the press.  Italy sold 3.75 billion euros ($4.8 billion) of its\nbenchmark three-year bond to yield  2.86 percent , more than the\n2.75 percent at the last auction of the same securities on Sept.\n13. Investors bid for 1.67 times the amount offered, up from\n1.49 times last month, indicating investors are still willing to\ninvest in the country.  The MSCI All-Country  World Index (MXWO)  advanced as much as 0.8\npercent, while the Standard & Poor\u2019s GSCI gauge of raw materials\nadded as much has 1.5 percent as corn and soybeans led gains.
