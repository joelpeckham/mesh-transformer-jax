 "context": "The following article called 'S&P 500 Trims Longest Monthly Gain in 1 Year on Bernanke' was published on 2012-02-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. stocks fell, trimming the\nlongest monthly rally in a year for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\nIndex, as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  gave no\nindication of further measures to stimulate the economy.  Commodity shares had the biggest decline in the S&P 500\namong 10 groups as gold tumbled the most since December.  Newmont\nMining Corp. (NEM) , the largest U.S. gold producer, slumped 4.2\npercent.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world\u2019s largest maker of thin-\nfilm solar panels, retreated 11 percent after reporting an\nunexpected loss.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  topped $500 billion in market\ncapitalization for the first time, rising 1.3 percent.  The S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent to 1,365.68 at 4 p.m. New York\ntime, retreating from an almost four-year high. It still rose\n4.1 percent in February, capping a third straight month of\ngains.

The Russell 2000 Index slid 1.6 percent to 810.94.  \u201cWe have a bit of investor nosebleed,\u201d said Bruce McCain,\nwho helps oversee more than $20 billion as chief investment\nstrategist at the private-banking unit of KeyCorp in  Cleveland .\n\u201cThere are still things to worry about. With the absence of\nmore stimulus, that would lead us to question: what\u2019s there to\nmove us out of some of that? In addition, we\u2019ve had a big run-up\nin stocks. No trees grow to the sky.\u201d  The  S&P 500  has risen 8.6 percent this year on better-than-\nestimated economic data. Measures of technology and financial\nshares had the biggest gains among 10 groups in 2012, adding at\nleast 13 percent. The Dow, which yesterday topped 13,000, capped\nits  fifth  straight month of gains.  \u2018Far From Normal\u2019  Stocks fell as Bernanke also said in congressional\ntestimony that the job market remains \u201cfar from normal\u201d and\nrising oil prices may cause inflation to grow temporarily.\nEarlier today, stocks gained as data showed the  U.S. economy \nexpanded more than forecast and business activity accelerated.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a bull or a bear, you have to\nacknowledge that the economy is growing,\u201d Ethan Anderson,\nsenior portfolio manager for Rehmann Financial in  Grand Rapids ,\n Michigan , said in a telephone interview. His firm manages $1.5\nbillion. \u201cYet the market is like a roller-coaster. People want\nto ride it, but you got to give them a chance to get off. Once\nthat happens, it can continue to move higher.\u201d  Commodity shares in the S&P 500 fell 1.7 percent as a\ngroup. Newmont Mining slid 4.2 percent to $59.43.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) \ndeclined 1.9 percent to $10.17.  Biggest Decline  First Solar tumbled 11 percent, the biggest decline in the\nS&P 500, to $32.30. The company also reduced its 2012 revenue\n forecast  to $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion, compared with a\nDecember forecast of $3.7 billion to $4 billion.  Staples Inc. (SPLS)  declined 8.4 percent to $14.66. The world\u2019s\nlargest office products company gave a 2012 forecast that was\n\u201clower quality\u201d than analysts expected, Jefferies Group Inc.\u2019s\nDaniel Binder wrote in a report.  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  dropped 6.5 percent to $10.30.\nThe Texas-based pay-as-you-go wireless carrier was  cut  to\n\u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d at UBS AG.  DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA)  lost 12 percent, the most\nsince July 2005, to $17.26. The maker of the \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d\nfilms said fourth-quarter profit tumbled 72 percent as DVD sales\ndeclined.  Apple rose 1.3 percent to a record $542.44, gaining for a\nfifth day. Apple investors are anticipating a sales boost from\nthe company\u2019s latest iPad tablet computer, due on March 7.  Potential Dividend  They\u2019re also banking on a new iPhone coming by the third\nquarter and the possibility of Apple offering a dividend, its\nfirst since 1995, said Howard Ward, a  money manager  at Gamco\nInvestors Inc. in Rye,  New York . Demand for Apple\u2019s products has\nhelped the company increase profit faster than its stock price,\nmaking the price-to-earnings ratio more favorable, he said.  \u201cImpressively, its market cap has risen to the $500\nbillion level as its price-to-earnings multiple has actually\ncontracted,\u201d said Ward, who helps oversee $36 billion in\nassets. \u201cAt 12 times this year\u2019s expectation of earnings, it\nstands in stark contrast to the experience of  Cisco Systems ,\nwhich sold at over  100 times earnings  when it approached the\n$500 billion level in 2000.\u201d  A measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes climbed 3.6\npercent as a weekly survey by International Strategy &\nInvestment Group showed an index of homebuilder activity rose to\nthe highest level since April 2006.  Orders Climb  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  jumped 4.6 percent to $23.46. Chief\nExecutive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. told CNBC yesterday that\norders for the spring season have surged 45 percent. PulteGroup\nInc. added 6.3 percent to $8.82.  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  rose 3.9 percent\nto $23.38.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) \u2019s Laurence D. Fink said savers need to\nbecome more aggressive investors as returns on bank accounts and\nTreasuries shrink and people grow older. The traditional mix of\nputting 60 percent of assets in stocks and 40 percent in bonds\nis inadequate in a \u201cnew world\u201d characterized by an aging\npopulation, a reduction in borrowing and risk-taking by\nindividuals and governments, and a greater role of emerging\neconomies.  \u201cI\u2019ve personally said I would be 100 percent in\nequities,\u201d Fink, 59, said in prepared remarks today to the\n Council on Foreign Relations  in New York. \u201cMost investors need\na more diversified portfolio, but virtually every investor has\nto find ways to achieve better returns than they\u2019ll get in cash\nor government bonds for the foreseeable future.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nRita Nazareth in New York at \n rnazareth@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nNick Baker at \n nbaker7@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Toll Brothers Inc. was 21.262327194213867 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Toll Brothers Inc. was ",
