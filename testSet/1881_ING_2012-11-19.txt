 "context": "The following article called 'Hungary-IMF Pact Doubted in Analyst Poll' was published on 2012-11-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHungary \u2019s outlook for obtaining\n International Monetary Fund  aid before the 2014 elections\nremains clouded a year after talks started, with a plurality of\neconomists in a poll predicting there would be no agreement.  Ten of 22 analysts from  London  to Budapest said Hungary\u2019s\nnegotiations with the IMF and the European Union won\u2019t yield an\naccord in the next 1 1/2 years, compared with eight who expect a\ndeal and four who give it a 50 percent chance, according a\nBloomberg survey. None predicted an aid package in 2012.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  sought aid on Nov. 17, 2011 as\nthe forint plunged to a record low against the euro, the\ncountry\u2019s credit rating was cut to junk and the government\nstruggled to sell debt at auctions. Talks for a loan of about 15\nbillion euros ($19 billion) have been delayed because of Orban\u2019s\nresistance to meet legal and economic terms set by the lenders.  \u201cThere will be no IMF agreement before elections unless\nthere is a significant deterioration in  market sentiment ,\u201d Nora Szentivanyi, a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  economist in London, said by\ne-mail.  The forint has gained 10.9 percent against the euro this\nyear, the world\u2019s best performance. Hungary has benefited from\nstimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the  European Central\nBank ; investors\u2019 hunt for higher-yielding assets amid record-low\nrates in the developed world; and speculation that the\ngovernment is nearing a loan accord with the IMF and the EU.  The currency advanced 0.2 percent to 284.13 per euro by\n9:31 a.m. in Budapest.  \u2018Really 50-50\u2019  The cost to insure Hungarian government debt against non-\npayment with five-year credit-default swaps fell to 317 basis\npoints from as high as 735 points Jan. 5, data compiled by\nBloomberg show. The yield on the benchmark 10-year forint-\ndenominated government bond dropped to 6.91 percent from 10.8\npercent on Jan. 4.  The performance of Hungarian assets may convince the\ngovernment that it doesn\u2019t need IMF assistance, said David Nemeth, an economist at  ING Groep NV (INGA)  in Budapest.  \u201cIt\u2019s really 50-50 and it depends on the market but if\nthings will go as well next year as this year then my guess is\nthere won\u2019t be an agreement,\u201d Nemeth said in an e-mail.  Orban shunned the IMF after winning a two-thirds\nparliamentary majority in 2010 to conduct economic policy\nwithout having to adhere to lending conditions.  \u2018Unorthodox\u2019 Measures  The government implemented what it called \u201cunorthodox\u201d\nmeasures to keep the  budget  under control without backtracking\non election pledges to end five years of austerity and to\nintroduce a flat-rate personal income tax. It effectively\nnationalized private-pension savings and levied industry taxes\non financial, energy, telecommunications and retail companies.  The measures damaged investor confidence, while  Europe \u2019s\nlargest bank levy contributed to curtailing credit as the\nforeign lenders that control most of the country\u2019s financial\nindustry cut support to their units to repair balance sheets and\ncomply with tighter rules.  Hungary last year lost its investment grade at  Fitch\nRatings ,  Standard & Poor\u2019s  and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, while\nthe forint plunged 15 percent against the euro in the second\nhalf of last year, the most in the world.  The economy is in its second recession in four years. The\n contraction  continued in the third quarter this year, with gross\ndomestic product shrinking 1.5 percent from June to September\ncompared with a year earlier. That is making it more difficult\nfor the government to keep the  budget deficit  within the EU\u2019s 3\npercent limit.  \u2018Balanced, Sustainable\u2019  The government backtracked on a pledge to cut a bank tax in\nhalf, raised a financial transaction levy, announced charges on\nutilities, and renounced a plan to raise teachers\u2019 wages.  The policies widen the distance between Hungary and the\nIMF. The Washington-based lender is looking for a \u201cbalanced and\nsustainable package of measures\u201d from Hungary, Gerry Rice, an\nIMF spokesman, said on Oct. 4.  The Cabinet decided to make the special bank levy permanent\nand raised the tax load of energy companies as it seeks to\nensure the 2013 shortfall will be 2.7 percent of GDP, the\n Economy Ministry  said on Nov. 16. That was the third set of\nmeasures announced by the government to shore up next year\u2019s\nbudget.  Billboard Campaign  IMF and EU officials held a week of \u201cconstructive\u201d talks\nin Budapest in July, following a seven-month standoff over a\ncentral bank law the lenders said would have undermined the\n Magyar Nemzeti Bank \u2019s independence.  Optimism about a deal faded as Hungary launched an anti-IMF\nbillboard campaign last month. The Washington-based lender has\nno date set to continue talks, Rice said Nov. 1.  Elections in 2014 may be the biggest obstacle to a deal as\nsupport for Orban\u2019s ruling party has slipped since 2010,\naccording to Attila Tibor Nagy, an analyst at the  Meltanyossag \npolitical research institute in Budapest.  \u201cAs elections approach the government can\u2019t pass austerity\nmeasures\u201d or give up on the flat tax \u201cwhose biggest\nbeneficiaries are Fidesz voters,\u201d Nagy said in phone interview\nNov. 15.  Orban\u2019s Fidesz leads all parties with 22 percent backing,\naccording to a Median poll published on HVG weekly\u2019s website on\nNov. 7. Egyutt 2014, a newly formed opposition umbrella group,\nhad 14 percent, followed by 10 percent both for the Socialist\nParty, and the radical nationalist Jobbik, Median said. No\nmargin of error was given.  The government insists that it is nearing an aid deal.\nOrban on Nov. 16 said the government wants to reach an agreement\nand is close to a pact.  A deal may be reached if market conditions deteriorate,\naccording to several economists in the Bloomberg survey,\nincluding  Neil Shearing  of Capital Economics Ltd. in London.  \u201cIf the euro crisis escalates once again - and our house\nview is that it will - then Hungary could come under serious\npressure,\u201d Shearing said in an e-mail. \u201cThis in turn could\nprove the trigger for a deal with the IMF.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nZoltan Simon in Budapest at \n zsimon@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nBalazs Penz at \n bpenz@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was 6.187144756317139 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ING Group, N.V. was ",
