 "context": "The following article called 'Xstrata\u2019s Davis, Reid Said to Plan Mine Fund After Glencore Deal' was published on 2013-03-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nXstrata (XTA)  Plc Chief Executive Officer\nMick Davis and Chief Financial Officer Trevor Reid are weighing\nplans to set up a privately backed mining fund after  Glencore\nInternational Plc (GLEN)  takes over their company, people familiar with\nthe matter said.  The fund would probably buy the undeveloped resources that\nmajor mining companies are looking to sell, the people said,\nasking not to be identified before a public announcement. While\nthe plans aren\u2019t final, Davis and Reid would likely search for\ninvestors in  emerging markets  and the Middle East, they said.  The executives would join peers raking through the world\u2019s\nunexploited mining assets. Bankers led by Lloyd Pengilly,\nformerly at JPMorgan Chase & Co., are also setting up a London-\nbased fund with investors from countries including Poland and\nQatar. That firm plans to invest mainly in African mining. An\nXstrata official declined to comment on Davis and Reid\u2019s plans.  The world\u2019s largest mine operators are selling assets after\na $1.1 trillion takeover binge in the past decade left producers\nincluding  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and Rio Tinto Group writing down\nvaluations. Rio, the second-largest mining company, is seeking a\nbuyer for its Canadian iron-ore operations, a person close to\nthe matter said last week. It has already raised about $12\nbillion from divesting more than 20 projects.  Davis, 55, scheduled to leave Xstrata six months after the\ncompletion of the $35 billion takeover by Glencore, built the\nproducer from a disparate collection of mostly South African\ncoal-mining assets into one of the largest mining companies.  Investor Revolt  He was slated to become CEO of the merged group until Ivan Glasenberg, head of Glencore, increased the bid for Xstrata on\ncondition Davis give up the top job. That followed an investor\nrevolt over bonus payments planned for managers including Davis.  Davis, who hands over to Glasenberg after the six months,\nwill get his contractual termination fee of 9.6 million pounds\n($14 million) without any retention bonus, according to Xstrata.\nIn contrast, Glasenberg, 56, will get $173 million in dividend\npayments from Glencore\u2019s 2012 earnings for his 16 percent stake.  Reid on Dec. 4 decided against remaining as CFO at the\nmerged company after the shareholders rejected paying a total of\n144 million pounds of bonuses to managers to spur them to stay.
