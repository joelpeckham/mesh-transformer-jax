 "context": "The following article called 'Libor Rate Conspiracy Seen in Home-Loan Borrowers\u2019 Suit' was published on 2012-10-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of\nAmerica Corp.  and 10 other lenders were sued by a group of U.S.\nhomeowners who claim the banks conspired to manipulate the\nbenchmark Libor rate, driving up the cost of  mortgage loans .  Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, is based on a\nBritish Bankers\u2019 Association-commissioned daily survey that asks\nlenders to estimate how much it would cost to borrow money from\neach other for various periods in 10 different currencies. The\nfigures are used to set interest rates for more than\n$300 trillion of securities and loans worldwide.  The homeowners\u2019 complaint, filed in federal court in\nManhattan earlier this month, is one of several class action, or\ngroup, lawsuits seeking to hold banks responsible for the\nalleged manipulation of the rate used as a borrowing-cost\nbenchmark.  \u201cDefendants\u2019 anticompetitive conduct had severe adverse\nconsequences on the plaintiffs by increasing the  interest rate \ncharged on their LIBOR-based loans and causing them to suffer\nfinancial losses,\u201d the borrowers said in the Oct. 4 complaint.  The lenders\u2019 alleged conspiracy from January 2000 to\nFebruary 2009 violated U.S. racketeering laws, the homeowners\nsaid.  Bank of America and co-defendants  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Royal\nBank of Scotland  are among the banks under investigation for\nLibor-rate tampering. Another named defendant in the lawsuit,\n Barclays Plc. (BARC) , was fined $450 million in June by U.S. and U.K.\nregulators for submitting false answers to the daily canvass.\nChief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  and Chairman Marcus Agius\nresigned in the aftermath.  Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup,\n Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase and\nLawrence Grayson, a spokesman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-\nbased Bank of America, declined to comment on the homeowners\u2019\nallegations.  Preparing Charges  U.S. prosecutors are preparing to file charges later this\nyear against traders from several banks involved in a bid-\nrigging scheme to manipulate Libor rates, a person familiar with\nthe case, who asked not to be identified because the matter is\nconfidential, told  Bloomberg News  in July.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Connecticut\nAttorney General George Jepsen are jointly investigating the\nallegations and have issued subpoenas to New York-based JPMorgan\nChase as well as to USB AG and Deutsche Bank AG.  The latter two lenders are also defendants in the borrower\nlawsuit, which seeks unspecified money damages together with an\norder permanently barring the bank from rigging the Libor rate.  Consolidated Cases  U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald in Manhattan is\npresiding over consolidated pre-trial proceedings in almost 30\nlawsuits alleging antitrust violations related to Libor. The\nborrowers\u2019 case hasn\u2019t yet been assigned to a judge.  The plaintiffs, all from  Alabama , are represented by\nMobile, Alabama, lawyer John W. Sharbrough and Mill Neck, New\nYork attorney Stephen Stim. While they are suing in part for\nalleged violations of New York state law, they seek to represent\nresidents of all 50 U.S. states.  The case is Adams v.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , 12-cv-07461,\nU.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).
