 "context": "The following article called 'Portugal Billionaire Sells Lollipops, Champagne in Poland' was published on 2013-01-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIn 2003, Luis Amaral bought  Eurocash\nSA (EUR) , a Warsaw-based grocery business, for 120 million Polish\nzlotys ($30 million). The operation was losing money.\nCompetitors were taking market share. Its owner,  Jeronimo\nMartins SGPS SA (JMT) , the Lisbon-based retail operation controlled by\nbillionaire Alexandre Soares Dos Santos, wanted nothing to do\nwith it.  Today, Eurocash is  Poland \u2019s biggest distributor of non-\ndurable goods, with 19 percent of the market. The company\u2019s\nvalue has surged more than 15-fold since selling shares in an\ninitial public offering in 2005, helping Amaral, the 51-year-old\nchief executive officer and  Portugal  native, amass a $1.1\nbillion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  Amaral\u2019s 44 percent stake in Eurocash, which sold about 7.8\nmillion lollipops and 3 million bottles of champagne last year,\nis valued at about $910 million. He has collected about $220\nmillion in dividends and stock sales since the public offering,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg, and has never appeared\non an international wealth ranking.  \u201cHe\u2019s a visionary who created a custom-built business for\nthe Polish market,\u201d said Jakub Krawczyk, a Vienna-based analyst\nat Raiffeisen Centrobank AG in a phone interview on Jan. 9.\n\u201cEurocash has helped traditional retailers to survive against\nthe onslaught of giant supermarkets.\u201d  Community Grocers  The value of publicly traded food retailers have surged in\nthe past six months on better-than-expected sales. Retail\nfortunes on the Bloomberg ranking rose 19.5 percent on average\nin 2012. The four heirs to the  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  fortune --\nJim Walton, Christy Walton,  Alice Walton  and Rob Walton --gained\na combined $13.5 billion.  Stefan Persson , the chairman of\nSwedish clothing retailer  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , added $2.7\nbillion during the year.  \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on his personal wealth,\u201d said Jan\nDomanski, the company\u2019s head of  investor relations , in a phone\ninterview on Jan. 9. \u201cHe is a very private person.\u201d  Eurocash, whose wholesale stores sell grocery items,\nalcoholic beverages and other supplies, saw revenue increase 68\npercent to 12.4 billion PLN in the first nine months of 2012\nfrom a year earlier. About half of Eurocash\u2019s sales are\ngenerated from independent grocery stores, an important element\nof most Polish communities.  \u2018Hypermarket Invasion\u2019  The company\u2019s growth comes amid increased competition from\ninternational hypermarket chains such as Tesco Plc, the biggest\nfood retailer in the U.K., and  Carrefour SA (CA) , the world\u2019s second-\nlargest food seller. Carrefour, which has 248 supermarkets and\nhypermarkets in Poland, announced plans to build 200 smaller\nstores in the country in July.  \u201cThe large chains are non-Polish owned and mom-and-pops\nare very frightened of the hypermarket invasion,\u201d Charles\nAllen, an analyst for Bloomberg Industries in Princeton,  New\nJersey , said by phone. \u201cEurocash is listed in Poland and offers\na defense.\u201d  Eurocash also operates its own retail stores. Many Poles\nare loyal to their corner shop, preferring to buy milk,\nvegetables and other household goods there instead of at the\nlarger hypermarkets.  Amaral is not the first wholesaler to become a billionaire\nserving independent grocery stores. South African Nathan \u201cNatie\u201d Kirsh, 81, owns 63 percent of Jetro Holdings, a\nwholesale grocer that operates about 100 stores in the U.S.  Accounting Software  After acquiring Jetro in 1985, Kirsh targeted small grocers\nunder-served by large distributors, then expanded to supplying\nindependent restaurants. He controls a $5.4 billion fortune,\naccording to the Bloomberg ranking.  Amaral moved to Poland from Portugal in 1995 to work for\nJeronimo Martins, where he helped establish Biedronka, now the\ncountry\u2019s largest discount retail chain. He left moved to  South\nAmerica  in 2000, eventually settling in  Brazil , where he became\na partner in a private equity firm.  In 2003, Amaral returned to Poland to buy Eurocash.\nJeronimo Martins was struggling to recover from a faulty\nimplementation of productivity and accounting software that\nthreatened to destroy its business, and sold Eurocash to focus\non its expanding Biedronka chain, Allen said.  \u201cThe whole of Jeronimo Martins was in bad shape,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cA lot of people didn\u2019t think Eurocash would survive.\u201d  Financing Acquisitions  Eurocash had 48 stores when Amaral purchased it in a\n management buyout . He focused on expansion, using the company\u2019s\nprofits to finance acquisitions, buying Premium Distributors,\nthe biggest alcoholic beverages distributor in Poland, in 2010\nfrom Warsaw-based  Central European Distribution Corp. (CEDC)   A year later, Amaral paid 1.1 billion PLN for the Tradis\ndistribution unit of Warsaw-based retail distributor Emperia\nHolding SA. The company opened its 150th Eurocash Cash & Carry\nstore in Poznan, Poland this month.  Amaral is expanding beyond food. In September, Eurocash\nagreed to buy at least 25 percent of cosmetics maker Polbita-\nInterchem Group for an undisclosed sum from Warsaw-based\nprivate equity firm Resource Partners Holdings.
