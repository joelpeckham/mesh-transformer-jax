 "context": "The following article called 'Intervention Call by Asia Executives as Currencies in Best Start Since \u201906' was published on 2012-03-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAsian exporters, battling a slump in\ndemand, are calling for their central banks to intervene after\ncapital inflows contributed to the  best start  to the year on\nrecord for the region\u2019s currencies.  Executives at LG Chem Ltd.,  South Korea \u2019s biggest chemicals\nmaker, and Bangkok-based Chengteh Chinaware ( Thailand ) Co. said\npolicy makers should curb volatility, while TLtek Co., an\nexporter of auto-part making machines based on the outskirts of\n Seoul , cites the won\u2019s strength against the euro for its\ncurrency losses. The chairman of the Malaysian American\nElectronics Industry, which represents U.S. companies such as\nMotorola Inc., and Dell Inc., said the central bank should\n\u201cstabilize the ringgit.\u201d  Asian policy makers switched focus to spurring economic\ngrowth after slowing inflation prompted  Indonesia (IDBIRATE) , the\n Philippines  and Thailand to cut interest rates in the past six\nmonths. The ringgit, won and Chinese yuan climbed more than 5\npercent against the euro in the past year, making exports less\ncompetitive as  Europe \u2019s debt crisis damps demand. The Bloomberg-\nJPMorgan Asian Dollar  Index (ADXY)  tracking regional currencies against\nthe greenback rose 2 percent this year, the most since the data\ngoes back to 1995.  \u201cThe central bank should intervene in case gains in the\nwon quicken and threaten tolerable levels,\u201d Owen Sung, chief\nspokesman at LG Chem in Seoul, said in a Feb. 28 interview. \u201cA\nsudden rally in the won will hurt our export earnings.\u201d  Falling Shipments  Policy makers are more likely to focus on the slowdown in\nglobal growth rather than the threat of rising  oil prices  on\ninflation, according to Sameer Goel, the head of Asian rates and\ncurrency strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in Singapore. Crude\nreached a 10-month high of $110.55 on March 1 and has risen 8.3\npercent this year.  \u201cThe export cycle has definitely been slowing down,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThere\u2019s a less obvious reason for them to allow\nappreciation to tackle imported inflation at this stage of the\ncycle, unless oil prices remain a persistent concern.\u201d  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330) , the world\u2019s largest\ncontract manufacturer of chips, posted a third straight decline\nin profit in the three months ended Dec. 31.  Hyundai Steel Co. (004020) ,\nSouth Korea\u2019s second-biggest steelmaker, saw lower profit in the\nquarter and forecast a 3.9 percent drop in sales in 2012.  Tata\nSteel Ltd. (TATA) ,  India \u2019s biggest producer, reported an unexpected\nloss after demand weakened in Europe.  Overseas sales in South Korea slowed to an average 6.8\npercent in the first two months of 2012 after increasing 8.2\npercent in December, Nomura Holdings Inc. estimated after\naccounting for the Lunar New Year Holiday.  Shipments (PHEXYOY)  from the\nPhilippines shrank for an eighth month in December.  Capital Inflows  Money that policy makers in Europe and the U.S. are pumping\ninto their economies is finding its way to  Asia , where  interest\nrates  are higher. Emerging-market bond funds attracted record\ninflows of $2.14 billion in the first week of February and $8.7\nbillion this year, according to data compiled by Cambridge,\nMassachusetts-based research firm EPFR Global.  Expanding capital inflows have an inflationary effect and\ncomplicate policy making, Philippine central bank Governor\nAmando Tetangco said at a forum in  Manila  on Feb. 28. Bank\nNegara  Malaysia  is seeking an \u201corderly\u201d market and doesn\u2019t see\na threat of imported inflation, Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz said\non Feb. 27. Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Suchada Kirakul\nsaid Feb. 29 it had intervened \u201ca little bit\u201d in the fourth\nweek of February. Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution said\non Feb. 10 that the monetary authority had an intervention\nstrategy to preserve stability.  Curbing Volatility  Brazil  is ready to take more measures to stem a rally in\nthe real, the world\u2019s third-best performing major currency in\n2012, after broadening the scope of a tax on foreign loans and\nbonds, Finance Minister Guido Mantega said on March 1.  Asian nations, whose foreign-exchange reserves dropped at\nthe height of the emerging-market sell-off in September, will\nprobably intervene to replenish their holdings, New York-based\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts Robin Brooks and Stacy Carlson\nwrote in a Feb. 1 report.  A rebound in reserves in South Korea and  Indonesia  this\nyear signaled policy makers probably sold their currencies.\nSouth Korea\u2019s holdings rose 1.4 percent in February to $315.8\nbillion after increasing 1.6 percent the previous month, Bank of\nKorea data today showed. Indonesia\u2019s reserves climbed 1.7\npercent to $112 billion in January after retreating in the four\nmonths through December.  China  has curbed volatility in the yuan since a government\nreport on Feb. 10 showed exports shrank in January for the first\ntime since November 2009, keeping the currency at 6.3 per dollar.\nThe currency rose 8.3 percent since the start of 2010.  \u2018Stabilize the Ringgit\u2019  \u201cThe yuan\u2019s rise has seriously hurt our U.S. businesses,\u201d\nsaid Eva Chen, sales manager of Pacific Wide Ltd., a Taiwan-\nregistered company with factories in Guangxi, China, that\nexports lamps. \u201cBut we are very lucky we started expanding in\nChina\u2019s domestic market last year,\u201d Chen said in an interview\nin Taipei on Feb. 17.  Malaysia\u2019s  export  growth slowed to 6.1 percent in December,\nthe least since May, a report in February showed. Inflation has \nheld around 3 percent for the past year. The ringgit reached \n2.9873 per dollar on March 1, the strongest level since \nSeptember.  \u201cWe hope the ringgit will be stable round 3.1,\u201d Wong Siew Hai, chairman of the Malaysian American Electronics Industry,\nsaid in an e-mail on Feb. 20. Bank Negara \u201cneeds to stabilize\nthe ringgit to a narrow range so that it\u2019s more predictable and\nhelp businesses to be competitive,\u201d he said.  India\u2019s growth is inevitably going to be slower partly due\nto a \u201chostile\u201d global environment,  Reserve Bank  of India\nDeputy Governor Subir Gokarn said in Mumbai on March 1.  Rising Risks  \u201cThe exchange-rate risk on the bottom-line has\nincreased,\u201d Manish Mandhana, joint managing director at\n Mandhana Industries Ltd. (MMDN) , a garment supplier to Tommy Hilfiger\nBV, said in an interview on Feb. 22 from Mumbai. \u201cThe\ndevelopments in Europe haven\u2019t been encouraging, which means we\nhave to tighten our costs to maintain margins.\u201d  Developing Asia may grow 7.3 percent this year, compared\nwith an earlier forecast of 8 percent and an expansion of 7.9\npercent in 2011, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a\nreport last month. Currency intervention is a valid instrument\nfor emerging-market central banks to use to \u201cachieve sustained\nand stable growth,\u201d the IMF wrote in the Feb. 29 report.  \u201cThe strengthening baht will make life a lot harder for us\nbecause we also need to cope with rising wage and energy\ncosts,\u201d said Somnuk Nacasaksevee, deputy managing director at\nChengteh Chinaware, which makes Walt Disney Co. mugs shipped to\nthe U.S. and Europe. \u201cThe central bank should help minimize the\nvolatility.\u201d  Continued euro depreciation could affect Samsung\nElectronics Co.\u2019s earnings, Robert Yi, Seoul-based senior vice\npresident for investor relations, said in a conference call on\nJan. 27. The won has gained 2.4 percent against the euro in the\npast six months.  \u201cIt hurts my heart whenever I think of currency losses\nfrom deals settled in euros,\u201d said Ahn Yong Joon, chief\nexecutive officer at TLtek, which gets 30 percent of its sales\nfrom Europe. \u201cI am also a little concerned that orders from\nEurope may decline.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nLilian Karunungan in  Singapore  at \n lkarunungan@bloomberg.net ;\nYumi Teso in Bangkok at \n yteso1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSandy Hendry at \n shendry@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 30.882110595703125 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
