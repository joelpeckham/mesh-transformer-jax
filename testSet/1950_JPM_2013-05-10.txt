The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \u2019s leading\ndirectors urged shareholders to reject calls for Chief Executive\nOfficer  Jamie Dimon  to relinquish his dual role as chairman and\nchief executive officer, saying it \u201ccould be disruptive\u201d and\nagainst the best interests of investors.  \u201cAn inflexible approach to the question of whether one\nperson can serve as both chairman and CEO is not the right\nanswer,\u201d according to a letter today sent to shareholders of\nthe New York-based company. It was signed by former Exxon Mobil\nCorp. Chairman and CEO Lee R. Raymond, who serves as the board\u2019s\npresiding director, and former Johnson & Johnson Chairman and\nCEO William C. Weldon, who heads the panel\u2019s corporate\ngovernance and nominating committee.  Proxy advisers at Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional\nShareholder Services have told investors to vote for a separate\nchairman and oust some directors. Calls for Dimon, 57, to\nrelinquish the chairmanship have mounted since last May, when\nJPMorgan disclosed lapses in  risk controls  at its chief\ninvestment office in the so-called London Whale episode that led\nto at least $6.2 billion in losses on derivatives.  JPMorgan is the biggest  U.S. bank  by assets and deposits.  ISS on May 3 urged a vote in favor of splitting Dimon\u2019s\nroles and removing three directors.  Glass Lewis  urged\nshareholders May 7 to oust three members of the four-person risk\ncommittee as well as all three audit committee members following\ninternal and congressional investigations that \u201crevealed\nquestionable risk-management practices at both the senior\nmanagement and board levels.\u201d  The board\u2019s current structure provides \u201cappropriate\naccountability to our shareholders and counterbalance to the\ncombined CEO/Chair role,\u201d according to Raymond and Weldon.
