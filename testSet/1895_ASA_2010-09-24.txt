 "context": "The following article called 'Norway's Central Bank May Split Main Rate to Pay Banks Less for Deposits' was published on 2010-09-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNorway\u2019s central bank may be close\nto splitting its  benchmark rate  so it can pay banks less on\nlarge deposits and channel excess liquidity back into the\ninterbank market,  Nordea Bank AB  and  DnB NOR ASA  said.  Oslo-based Norges Bank may lower the rate it offers banks\non big deposits from the current 2 percent, according to\neconomists at Norway\u2019s two largest banks. The central bank,\nwhich has raised its main rate three times since October and\nsignalled a further increase at \u201cthe turn of the year,\u201d wants\nto discourage banks from leaving excess funds on its balance\nsheet rather than lending the money to other banks, according to\nGovernor  Svein Gjedrem .  The central bank said on Sept. 22 it will announce changes\nto the money market next month, though it declined to comment on\nwhether measures may include a rate split.  \u201cThe problem is redistribution of liquidity in the banking\nsystem,\u201d said  Anders Svor , assistant director at Norges Bank\u2019s\n Monetary Policy Department , in an interview yesterday. \u201cWe feel\nthat the banks are getting more passive, that they have a\nreduced incentive for redistributing liquidity.\u201d  Gjedrem said in a Sept. 6 speech the bank may push through\nchanges to discourage banks from depositing \u201csubstantial\u201d\namounts at the central bank. Tight credit flows have increased\nthe difference between short-term money market rates and the\ncentral bank\u2019s benchmark 2 percent rate, forcing Norges Bank to\nprovide more liquidity loans.  Swaps, Krone  The one-year Norwegian swap rate fell 2 basis points to\n2.74 percent, while the benchmark European swap rate rose 1\nbasis point to 1.21 percent and the rate in neighboring Sweden\nwas little changed at 1.65 percent. The swap rate is a fixed\nrate that is agreed to pay in exchange for payments based on the\nthree-month Norwegian interbank offered rate.  The krone fell 0.07 percent at 7.9281 versus the euro and\n0.4 percent versus the dollar to 5.9349 by 10:03 am in Oslo.  Over the past year the average daily surplus liquidity\ndeposited with the central bank has been about 40 billion kroner\n($6.7 billion), or about 10 billion kroner more than the average\nbetween 2003 and 2008, Svor said.  \u2018Not Happy\u2019  \u201cNorges Bank is not happy about the spread between the\ncentral bank rate and where the money market rate is fixing,\u201d\nsaid  Gaute Langeland , an interest-rate strategist at Nordea, in\nan interview. \u201cThey feel that a spread of 60 to 70 basis points\nis high; they feel that there is more liquidity in the Norwegian\nmarket now than there used to be before the financial crisis but\nthe liquidity isn\u2019t being distributed evenly. Banks are\nreluctant to distribute between themselves.\u201d  The  spread  between Norway\u2019s interbank offered rate and the\nbenchmark rate was at 62 basis points yesterday, compared with\n26 basis points at the end of 2009. A rate split is a likely\noption as Norges Bank wants to pay lenders less on their\ndeposits without reversing its tightening cycle needed to guide\nthe economy through its recovery, the economists said.  Deputy Governor  Jan F. Qvigstad  said the bank discussed how\nto change the way it steers the money market at its Sept. 22\npolicy rate meeting. Norges Bank may present a proposal in about\ntwo to three weeks, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s more structural,\u201d Qvigstad said in a Sept. 22\ninterview. \u201cThe financial crisis has revealed weaknesses in the\nway we have organized the short-term money market.\u201d  The bank this week  allocated 40 billion kroner  ($6.75\nbillion) of one-month loans at a 2.16 percent average rate. The\nauction attracted 68.75 billion kroner in bids.  Remove Floor  By splitting the benchmark deposit rate, Norges Bank will\nremove the floor from the money market that has guaranteed banks\na minimum return on their deposits with the central bank,\nLangeland said.  \u201cIn future there won\u2019t be this floor,\u201d he said.  Kyrre Aamdal , senior economist at DnB NOR, said introducing\na lower rate for large deposits is a likely strategy of the\ncentral bank.  \u201cDeposits over this limit will have another rate,\u201d he\nsaid in a phone interview.  Norges Bank, which last year became the first in Europe to\nincrease borrowing costs, was forced  to scale back its\ntightening plans  in June after Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis\ntriggered concern that austerity measures may slow the region\u2019s\nrecovery and sap demand for Norwegian exports.
