 "context": "The following article called 'Total Leads Surge in Oil Company Default Swaps on Gas Leak' was published on 2012-03-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTotal SA (FP)  led a surge in the cost of\ninsuring debt of European suppliers after a gas leak from\nFrance\u2019s largest oil producer\u2019s Elgin platform in the U.K. North\nSea entered its fourth day.  Credit-default swaps on Total soared 22.5 basis points to\n102.5 basis points, according to CMA at 3 p.m. in London, the\nhighest since Nov. 29 and up from 60 basis points March 26.\nSwaps on  ENI SpA (ENI)  jumped 17 to 144,  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  rose three to\n47,  BP Plc (BP/)  climbed four to 91 and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  rose\nthree to 60.  Total said it would take at least six months to drill an\nemergency well to stop escaping gases after a blowout on March\n25, and Shell shut the neighboring Shearwater field to guard\nagainst explosion. BP\u2019s  credit rating  was cut by  Standard &\nPoor\u2019s  in 2010 as it took five months to drill a relief well to\npermanently plug the worst U.S. oil spill.  \u201cWhile I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a risk they won\u2019t pay, there\nis obviously a risk of less flexibility in their financial\nmetrics and potential downgrade,\u201d said  Elisabeth Afseth , an\nanalyst at Investec Bank Plc in London. \u201cSome widening is\nclearly warranted but it\u2019s very tricky to say what is the right\namount and what is too much when nobody has any idea what is the\nscale of the incident.\u201d  Deepwater Rig  Swaps on BP soared to 577 basis points from about 40 as oil\nleaked into the  Gulf of Mexico  for 87 days after an explosion on\nthe Deepwater Horizon rig in April 2010 killed 11 workers. The\ncontracts dropped to about 70 basis points by the end of that\nyear.  Total surpassed BP today for the first time in two years.\nAn increase signals deterioration in perceptions of credit\nquality.  \u201cI expect, as with BP, that you may have consequences of a\nbig incident like that but it\u2019s not really going to affect their\ndebt substantially,\u201d Afseth said. \u201cThe  oil companies  have very\nstrong cash flow, so they can take quite a lot.\u201d  The cost of insuring corporate and financial debt in Europe\nalso rose, according to BNP Paribas SA. Contracts on the Markit\niTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield\ncredit ratings rose 7.5 basis points to 587.5. The Markit iTraxx\nEurope Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose\nthree basis points to 120 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of\n25 banks and insurers rose six basis points to 208 and the\nsubordinated index climbed 14 to 334.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10\nmillion euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five\nyears is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer\nface value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash\nequivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt\nagreements.
