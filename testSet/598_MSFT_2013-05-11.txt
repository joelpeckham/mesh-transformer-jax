 "context": "The following article called 'Seattle Group Raises Bid for NBA Sacramento Kings by $75 Million' was published on 2013-05-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA Seattle-based group led by Valiant\nCapital founder Chris Hansen raised its bid for the  Sacramento\nKings  by $75 million to $625 million, five days before  National\nBasketball Association team owners vote on whether to approve\nrelocation.  A 12-member panel of team owners on April 29 recommended\nunanimously that the NBA Board of Governors reject Hansen\u2019s bid\nto buy the Kings from the Maloof family and instead accept an\noffer put together by Sacramento Mayor  Kevin Johnson , a former\nNBA player. A final vote of the 30 franchise owners is scheduled\nfor May 15.  \u201cIn an effort to further demonstrate the extent of our\ncommitment to bring basketball back to Seattle, we have elected\nto voluntarily increase our proposed purchase price,\u201d Hansen\nsaid yesterday in a  blog post .  The record for an NBA team sale is $450 million, which Joe Lacob and  Peter Guber  spent to buy the Golden State Warriors in\n2010.  Hansen pointed out that the ownership group, which includes\n Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer , has\nacquired all the property needed to build a new arena and has in\nplace all the private funding for the venue.  \u201cWhile we appreciate that this is a very difficult\ndecision for the league and owners, we hope it is understood\nthat we really believe the time is now to bring the NBA back to\nSeattle, and that it is paramount that we do everything we can\nto put Seattle\u2019s best foot forward in this process,\u201d Hansen\nsaid.  Seattle lost its team in 2008, when the SuperSonics ended\ntheir 41-year stay by moving to Oklahoma City and becoming the\nThunder.  Sacramento Bid  Golden State Warriors part-owner  Vivek Ranadive , the\nfounder of  Tibco Software Inc. (TIBX) , would become the Kings\u2019 new\nmajority owner and a new arena would be built in Sacramento if\nNBA owners vote not to let the team relocate and the Maloofs\nagree to sell to the Sacramento group.  \u201cThe NBA leadership and owners have always said that their\ndecision would not be dictated by a bidding war,\u201d Johnson said\nyesterday on Twitter. \u201cI believe the owners realize that there\nis far more to think about than just an increased bid. They know\nwhat this story means to the NBA.\u201d  The Kings have been owned by the Maloofs since July 1999.\nThe family reached a preliminary deal with Sacramento in\nFebruary 2012 to build a new arena, only to have the accord fall\nthrough within two months.
