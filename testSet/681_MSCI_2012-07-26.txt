The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  Philippines  unexpectedly cut\n interest rates  and South Korea reported the slowest economic\ngrowth in almost three years as  Europe \u2019s debt crisis weighs on\nexports and increases the likelihood of more easing in  Asia .  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  reduced the rate it pays\nlenders for overnight deposits to a record-low 3.75 percent from\n4 percent, a decision predicted by four of 16 economists in a\nBloomberg News survey. The Bank of Korea said today that  gross\ndomestic product  expanded 2.4 percent in the three months\nthrough June from a year earlier.  The Philippines\u2019 move adds to central bank officials in\n Japan  and  Thailand  who indicated yesterday they are ready to\nease monetary policy if necessary. HSBC Holdings Plc forecasts\nthat  South Korea  will cut interest rates further this quarter\nafter Governor Kim Choong Soo said yesterday that Asia\u2019s fourth-\nlargest economy is losing steam faster than expected.  \u201cThe big tide from Europe is engulfing Asia and leaving\nmany policy makers helpless,\u201d said Lee Sang Jae, a senior\neconomist at Hyundai Securities Co. in  Seoul . \u201cThe worst may\nnot be over yet.\u201d  Asian  stocks  advanced for the first day in five after a\ndrop in U.S. new home sales fueled speculation the  Federal\nReserve  may take new steps to spur growth. The MSCI Asia Pacific\nIndex added 0.8 percent, South Korea\u2019s benchmark Kospi Index\nrose 0.7 percent and Japan\u2019s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.9\npercent.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  \u201cwill not hesitate\u201d to loosen monetary\npolicy should the world\u2019s third-biggest economy face shocks,\nDeputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi said. Thai Assistant Governor\nPaiboon Kittisrikangwan said \u201cwe are ready to do more\u201d if\nconditions deteriorate.  \u2018Bumpy Road\u2019  The world economy \u201chas been on a bumpy road and we will\nsee more bumps ahead,\u201d Kim Young Bae, a Bank of Korea director-\ngeneral told reporters in Seoul today after GDP figures were\nreleased. \u201cBut I hope and believe that the second half will be\nbetter as Europe is muddling through.\u201d  In contrast, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said downside\nrisks to growth are rising. Citigroup Inc. said in a note today\nthat odds have increased that the government will announce a\nsupplementary budget and \u201cit would not be so surprising\u201d if\nthe central bank cut interest rates next month.  Pause Extended  Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region,  New Zealand \u2019s central\nbank extended a pause in the benchmark interest rate.\n Singapore \u2019s  industrial production  rose more than economists\nestimated in June as pharmaceutical companies increased output,\ncountering a decline in electronics.  In Europe, the rate of growth in M3  money supply , which the\nECB uses as a gauge of future inflation, increased to 3.2\npercent in June from 3.1 percent in the previous month, the\n European Central Bank  said today.  M3 grew 3 percent in the second quarter from the same\nperiod a year earlier. M3 is the broadest gauge of money supply\nand includes cash in circulation, some forms of savings and\nmoney-market holdings.  In the U.S., durable goods orders in June may have risen\n0.3 percent from the previous month, after a revised 1.3 percent\ngain in May, according to the median analyst estimate. A report\nby the Labor Department may show weekly jobless claims were\n380,000 in the week ended July 21, compared with 386,000 the\nprevious week.  South Korea exports decreased 0.6 percent in the second\nquarter from the previous quarter, when overseas shipments\ngained 3 percent, today\u2019s BOK report showed. Corporate\ninvestment in facilities fell 6.4 percent from the previous\nquarter, when it rose 10.3 percent, while private consumption\nincreased 0.5 percent after advancing 1 percent.  Sustaining Consumption  \u201cKorean growth is becoming more dependent on domestic\ndemand as global trade remains sluggish, lowering growth\nprospects,\u201d Ronald Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at HSBC\nHoldings Plc, said before the release. \u201cSustaining private\nconsumption growth will be critical.\u201d  Seoul-based  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) , the world\u2019s No. 4 mobile-\nphone maker, reported yesterday that second-quarter profit\nmissed analysts\u2019 estimates after sales of handsets lagged behind\nrivals.  Not all news from Korean companies is bad. Hyundai Motor\nCo., the nation\u2019s largest carmaker, today reported second-\nquarter profit that beat analysts\u2019 estimates as sales of the\nTucson sport-utility vehicle helped the company buck an\nindustrywide drop in Europe.  The BOK lowered its main rate a quarter percentage point to\n3 percent on July 12, the first reduction since February 2009,\nas it joined a global stimulus push from Europe to  China . The\nfollowing day, the central bank pared its 2012 growth forecast\nto 3 percent from 3.5 percent, the second cut this year.  Not Immune  \u201cConsidering exports account for about half of our\neconomy, how can we stay immune to changes in the international\nlandscape and the European crisis?\u201d  Bank of Korea  Governor Kim\nsaid yesterday.  Economic support measures including assistance for small\nbusinesses and low-income earners announced on June 28 have yet\nto stem a slide in confidence. Consumer sentiment dropped to the\nlowest level in five months in July, the Bank of Korea said\nyesterday.  \u201cThere are increasing risks that the expected recovery\nwill be later or weaker than currently assumed,\u201d Ma Tieying, an\neconomist with DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore, said in a note before\ntoday\u2019s release.
