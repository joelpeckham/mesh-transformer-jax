The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAsian currencies fell the most this\nweek since January as policy makers from the  Philippines  to\nJapan proposed measures that tend to weaken their exchange\nrates.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  said April 4 it would double monthly bond\nbuying to 7 trillion yen ($72 billion) to fight deflation and\nSouth Korea\u2019s presidential office signaled it favors lower\nborrowing costs. The yen slumped to an June 2009 low yesterday,\nmaking its exports cheaper than those from Korea and Taiwan. The\nPhilippine central bank is considering steps to spur capital\noutflows, Governor Amando Tetangco said this week, while data\nsignaled the  U.S. economy  is starting to cool.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index declined 0.3\npercent since March 29, the most since the week ending Jan. 25.\nSouth Korea\u2019s won slumped 1.8 percent to a seven-month low of\n1,131.69 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe Philippine peso dropped 0.9 percent to 41.18 and India\u2019s\nrupee depreciated 1 percent to 54.8125, the most in a month.  \u201c Japan \u2019s surprisingly big size of stimulus sparked a\nstrong bout of dollar buying,\u201d said Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-\nbased currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. \u201cConcerns over a\nglobal economic recovery also weighed on emerging-market\ncurrencies this week.\u201d  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region\u2019s most-\nactive currencies excluding the yen, has retreated 1.5 percent\nfrom a 16-month high of 118.89 on Jan. 18.  Competing Exports  Taiwan\u2019s central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said March 28\nthat the island\u2019s and Japanese exports are 38 percent similar,\ncompared with 83 percent for South Korean and Japanese\nshipments.  Manufacturing in the U.S. trailed economists\u2019 forecasts in\nMarch and unemployment in the euro-area held at a record 12\npercent in February, official reports showed this week.  North Korea  said on April 3 that it will restart all\nfacilities at the Yongbyon nuclear site shut by a 2007\ndisarmament accord. Overseas funds pulled a net $625 million\nfrom the Korean stock market this week through April 4.  \u201cGeopolitical risk from the North Korean threat is likely\nto weigh on the won for an extended period of time,\u201d said Suh Dae Il, an analyst at KDB Daewoo Securities Co. in  Seoul .  India\u2019s rupee slid after the central bank said March 28\nthat the current-account  deficit  widened to a record $32.6\nbillion in the final quarter of 2012, from $22.6 billion in the\npreceding three months.  Ringgit Rallies  Malaysia\u2019s ringgit rallied 1.2 percent to 3.0570 per dollar\nfrom March 29 after Prime Minister Najib Razak dissolved\nparliament on April 3 and called for national elections. The\ncurrency reached a seven-month low of 3.1395 on March 18.  \u201cElections are probably going to be held before the end of\nApril and we expect to see funds coming back,\u201d said Wee-Khoon\nChong, a rates strategist in  Hong Kong  at Societe Generale SA.\n\u201cThe risk-reward is still favoring the incumbent to continue\nanother term.\u201d  Elsewhere in Asia,  China \u2019s  yuan  was at 6.2030 per dollar\nafter touching a 19-year high of 6.1986 on April 2 before\nmarkets closed for holidays April 4 and yesterday.
