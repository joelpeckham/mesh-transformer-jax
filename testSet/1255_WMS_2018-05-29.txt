(NYSE:WMS) (\u201cADS\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a leading global manufacturer of water management products and solutions for non-residential, residential, infrastructure and agricultural applications, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nNet sales increased 2.4% to $250.1 million Net income increased 73.1% to $4.9 million Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 114.8% to $27.0 million\nFiscal Year 2018 Highlights\nNet sales increased 5.8% to $1,330.4 million Net income increased 80.4% to $64.8 million Adjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 8.7% to $210.2 million Cash flow from operating activities increased 31.5% to $137.1 million Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) increased 65.8% to $95.4 million\nScott Barbour, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADS commented, \u201cWe had a strong finish to fiscal 2018, achieving our financial goals for the year through disciplined execution of our fundamentals, successfully converting traditional materials to our plastic pipe products and driving our water management solutions with allied products.\u201d\nBarbour continued, \u201cFrom a top line perspective, sales in our core domestic construction markets grew 500 basis points above the market. We focused on improving profitability through sharper operating execution and achieving better returns on our capital \u2013 two critical areas of focus since I came on board last September. I am happy to report that we have made significant strides towards these goals, which was key to achieving our profitability targets for the year. With fiscal 2018 now behind us, I am excited heading into the new year and look forward to additional growth and further progress towards achieving sustained profitability and improved performance through disciplined execution.\u201d\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results\nNet sales increased 2.4% to $250.1 million, as compared to $244.2 million in the prior year quarter. Domestic net sales increased 1.2% to $226.2 million as compared to $223.4 million in the prior year quarter, driven by favorable pricing and strong allied product sales in the construction markets. International net sales increased 15.1% to $23.9 million as compared to $20.8 million in the prior year quarter, driven by growth in Canadian construction markets and export sales.\nGross profit increased 22.6% to $48.1 million, as compared to $39.3 million the prior year quarter. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased 310 basis points to 19.2% compared to 16.1% in the prior year, primarily due to favorable pricing as well as lower manufacturing costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 114.8% to $27.0 million, as compared to $12.6 million in the prior year quarter. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA increased 570 basis points to 10.8% as compared to 5.1% in the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was largely attributed to the factors mentioned above as well as a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nReconciliations of GAAP to Non-GAAP financial measures for Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these measures is also included below under the heading \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nFiscal Year 2018 Results\nNet sales increased 5.8% to $1,330.4 million, as compared to $1,257.3 million in fiscal 2017. Domestic net sales increased 6.5% to $1,174.4 million as compared to $1,102.2 million in fiscal 2017, driven by growth in core construction markets and favorable pricing. International net sales increased slightly to $155.9 million as compared to $155.0 million in fiscal 2017.\nGross profit increased 2.3% to $302.5 million, as compared to $295.8 million in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased 80 basis points to 22.7% compared to 23.5% in fiscal 2017, primarily due to increases in raw material and operational costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP) increased 8.7% to $210.2 million, as compared to $193.4 million in fiscal 2017. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted EBITDA increased 40 basis points to 15.8% as compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin was largely attributed to the factors mentioned above.\nIncome tax expense decreased 53.6% to $11.4 million and reflected the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Act\u201d), including a $16.0 million benefit to income tax expense related to the revaluation of deferred tax attributes and a $1.0 million income tax expense on the Company\u2019s deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The income tax expense also included a $2.7 million benefit from the impact of the change in federal statutory rate.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased 31.5% to $137.1 million, as compared to $104.2 million in fiscal 2017. Free cash flow (Non-GAAP) increased 65.8% to $94.5 million, as compared to $57.6 million in fiscal 2017.

ADS management uses non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company\u2019s performance. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results available in the accompanying tables.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes references to Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures are not intended to be substitutes for those reported in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that comprise net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, non-cash charges and certain other expenses. The Company\u2019s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures. Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used by management and the Company\u2019s board of directors to assess financial performance and evaluate the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s business strategies. Accordingly, management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as the Company\u2019s management and board of directors. In order to provide investors with a meaningful reconciliation, the Company has provided below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income.\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow is a measure used by management and the Company\u2019s board of directors to assess the Company\u2019s ability to generate cash. Accordingly, management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures.
