 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Consumer Comfort Climbs to Highest Level Since April' was published on 2012-11-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nConsumer confidence  climbed last week\nas Americans\u2019 ratings of the economy reached the highest level\nin more than four years.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to minus 34.4 in\nthe period ended Nov. 4, the best reading since April, from\nminus 34.7 the previous week. Twenty percent of those surveyed\nhad a positive view of the world\u2019s largest economy, the most\nsince March 2008.  The gains may further invigorate household spending and\npropel retailers like Macy\u2019s Inc. ahead of the year-end\nholidays. The end of the contentious presidential race, combined\nwith an improving job market, may continue to boost sentiment\neven as the lingering effects of superstorm Sandy limit any\nshort-run rebound, according to economist  Joseph Brusuelas .  \u201cWith the election now in the rear-view mirror and the\nholidays ahead, the underlying improvement in the trend across\nall major consumer confidence readings will reassert itself in\ncoming weeks,\u201d said Brusuelas, a senior economist at Bloomberg\nLP in New York. \u201cThat being said, given the damage from the\nstorm, a transitory downdraft in consumer comfort should be\nexpected.\u201d  In a separate report today, Labor Department figures showed\nthe number of Americans filing first-time applications for\n unemployment benefits  declined last week as the effects of\n Hurricane Sandy  started to show up.  Jobless claims  dropped by\n8,000 to 355,000 in the week ended Nov. 3.  Stocks rose as JPMorgan Chase & Co. paced a rally in\nfinancial shares. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index gained 0.1\npercent to 1,396.42 at 9:33 a.m. in New York.  Economy Gauge  The comfort index\u2019s state of the economy gauge rose to\nminus 60.1 from minus 63.1 the previous week. The barometer\nmeasuring Americans\u2019 views of their personal finances was little\nchanged at minus 3.6 after minus 3.5 the previous week. The\nbuying climate index decreased to minus 39.3 from minus 37.4 the\nprevious week.  \u201cThe toughest economic recovery we have seen over the last\nseveral years appears to be finally gaining some traction with\nnoticeable improvements in retail sales, consumer confidence,\nunemployment and housing market,\u201d Steven Grimes, chief\nexecutive officer of Retail Properties of America Inc., a real\nestate investment service based in  Oak Brook ,  Illinois , said on\na Nov. 6 earnings conference call.  The rating on the  U.S. economy  has improved 11 percentage\npoints in the past month and 17 points since a recent low on\nAug. 19, today\u2019s figures showed.  The pickup in confidence is coinciding with more household\nspending. Retail sales in September and August had the best\nback-to-back showing since late 2010. Purchases rose 0.8 percent\nin September, the biggest gain since February, after advancing\n0.5 percent in August, the Commerce Department said on Oct. 29.  Labor Market  Progress in the labor market is also lifting Americans\u2019\nmoods. Employers added 171,000 workers in October, more than\nforecast, the Labor Department reported on Nov. 2.  \u201cThings are looking up, if I look at the job survey it\u2019s\nlooking better,\u201d said Don Krueger, 60, from  New York . Although\nhe recently lost his job in the financial services industry, he\nis optimistic about his employment prospects and is making\npurchases.  \u201cI\u2019ll be spending money, fixing up my house, maybe doing a\nfew real-estate transactions, taking advantage of some of the\nlow prices right now,\u201d said Krueger. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident I\u2019m\ngoing to get a job pretty quickly.\u201d  Presidential Election  In the week leading up to the election, the Bloomberg index\namong Democrats fell to minus 23.5 from minus 22.9 the previous\nweek. Republican sentiment decreased to minus 39.6 from minus\n37.8. Sentiment among Independents, or swing-voters, rose to\nminus 39.7, the highest since June, from minus 40.7 the prior\nweek.  \u201cThere was a clear political element to economic views\nheading into the election,\u201d with Democrats being the least\npessimistic, said  Gary Langer , president of New York-based\nLanger Research Associates, which compiles the index for\nBloomberg. \u201cIn political terms, the index was in poor\ncondition,\u201d having been closer to levels previously associated\nwith a loss by the incumbent or his party.  President  Barack Obama  prevailed over Republican  Mitt\nRomney  in an electoral sweep by carrying swing states such as\nColorado, Ohio and  Virginia .  Today\u2019s figures showed sentiment among those working full-\ntime and households earning more than $50,000 a year climbed to\nthe highest levels since January 2008.  Hurricane Sandy  Sentiment may suffer a temporary setback due to Sandy, the\nAtlantic superstorm that hit the Northeast U.S. last week and\ncaused widespread power outages, flooding and led to at least\n100 deaths. The storm caused as much as $50 billion in economic\ndamage, according to Eqecat Inc., a provider of catastrophic\nrisk models.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, compiled by Langer\nResearch Associates in New York, conducts telephone surveys with\na random sample of 1,000 consumers 18 and older. Each week, 250\nrespondents are asked for their views on the economy, personal\nfinances and buying climate; the percentage of negative\nresponses is subtracted from the share of positive views and\ndivided by three. The most recent reading is based on the\naverage of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every\nparticipant in the survey had a positive response to all three\ncomponents, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The\nmargin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.
