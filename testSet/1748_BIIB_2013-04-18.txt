 "context": "The following article called 'Elan Says Buyback Tender Strike Price Set at $11.25 per ADR' was published on 2013-04-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nElan Corp. (ELN)  said the strike price\nfor a buyback of 116.4 million shares was set at $11.25 per\nAmerican depository receipt, indicating a takeover bid by\nRoyalty Pharma may be set at that level.  Among the shares tendered, representing 14.8 percent of\ncurrent shares, 92.3 percent were sold by one corporate\nstakeholder, Elan said in a statement today. That shareholder is\n Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , which held an 18 percent stake in the\ncompany, according to Elan spokesman Jonathan Birt. Royalty\nPharma said this week it may set a takeover offer price of\n$11.25 if the shares are tendered at that price.  Elan, led by Chief Executive Officer Kelly Martin, is\nbuying back the shares to return a portion of the $3.25 billion\nit received after divesting its stake in the multiple sclerosis\ndrug Tysabri to U.S. partner  Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB)  Royalty Pharma\u2019s\ntakeover offer challenges Martin\u2019s plan to embark on company\nacquisitions to bring in new products.  Excluding J&J, which confirmed its share sale in a\nstatement, 73.1 percent of all shares weren\u2019t tendered,\nsuggesting that about 60 percent of the shareholding did not\ntender, UBS analyst Guillaume van Renterghem said in a note\ntoday.  Offer Prospects  \u201cThe fact that 60 percent of shares were not tendered\nmakes us believe that the likelihood of Royalty Pharma being\nsuccessful in its attempt to buy Elan has significantly\nreduced,\u201d van Renterghem said. \u201cA significant downside risk\nexists if the deal does not go through and the offer expires.\u201d  J&J\u2019s sale will result in an after-tax gain of about $213\nmillion, which it will invest in its business, the company said\nin the statement.  Elan shares rose 0.5 percent to 8.97 euros ($11.73) in\nDublin. Elan\u2019s American depository receipts climbed 0.2 percent\nto $11.90 at 12:01 p.m. in  New York .  The institutional shareholders holding on to their stakes\nindicates a vote of confidence in Elan, prompting the positive\nreaction in the market, van Renterghem said. J&J\u2019s relationship\nwith Elan had already been winding down after an Alzheimer\u2019s\ndrug they were jointly developing with Pfizer Inc.,\nbapineuzumab, failed in a late-stage clinical trial last year,\nhe said.
