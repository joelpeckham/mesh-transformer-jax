The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLONDON (Reuters) - The UK Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) on Wednesday awarded 123 licenses to 61 companies to explore for and develop new fields in the North Sea, in the latest sign of confidence in the aging basin that has enjoyed a revival in recent years.\nFILE PHOTO: Vessels that are used for towing oil rigs in the North Sea are moored at William Wright docks in Hull, Britain November 2, 2017. REUTERS/Russell Boyce/File Photo Companies ranging from Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Norway\u2019s Equinor, to smaller independents including Siccar Point, Chrysaor and Premier Oil were awarded 229 blocks covering a total area of 26,659 square km, the OGA said in a statement.\n\u201cThe OGA expects this round to lead very quickly to activity, providing a welcome boost to exploration,\u201d it said.\nFourteen of those licenses are expected to progress straight to field development planning, it said.\nThe round could unlock about a dozen undeveloped discoveries containing an estimated 320 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), it added.\nThe North Sea was one of the world\u2019s first offshore basins, and has produced oil for more than four decades.\nAlthough output in the basin has sharply declined since peaking in the late 1990s, it has seen a revival in recent years after large projects such as the BP-operated, 130,000-barrels-per-day Quad 204 in the western Shetlands came on line.\nThe OGA estimates the North Sea holds reserves of 1.5 billion boe.\n\u201cThe OGA\u2019s first mature licencing round, following the Norwegian model, appears to have been a great success,\u201d Wood Mackenzie analyst Kevin Swann said in a note.\n\u201cThe UK is in desperate need of new projects to fill a development pipeline that is all but empty beyond the early 2020s,\u201d Swann said.\n\u201cThe eight firm exploration wells among the awards, with big companies like Shell, BP, Equinor and ConocoPhillips among those set to drill, is a big vote of confidence in the UK. It shows the big players are not ready to leave UK waters yet.\u201d\nReporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Dale Hudson and Amanda Cooper\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of BP p.l.c. was 37.952232360839844 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of BP p.l.c. was ",
