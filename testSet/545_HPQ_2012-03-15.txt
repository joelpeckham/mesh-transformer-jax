 "context": "The following article called 'Costa Rica Tax Changes Pass to Supreme Court After Congress Vote' was published on 2012-03-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCosta Rica\u2019s Congress last night\ngave initial approval to an overhaul of the tax system aimed at\nparing a fiscal deficit equal to more than 5 percent of gross\ndomestic product.  The legislation now awaits a  Supreme Court  ruling on\nopposition allegations that its fast-track treatment by\nlawmakers was unconstitutional. The tribunal takes an average 18\nmonths to decide on constitutional matters, court spokeswoman\nVanlly Cantillo said.  The new system would add about $650 million annually to\ngovernment revenue, according to the Finance Ministry. Changes\ninclude replacing the 13 percent sales tax with a 14 percent\nvalue-added tax and imposing a 15 percent tax on dividends\nearned by companies that enter the country\u2019s free-trade zones\nafter 2015.  Costa Rica\u2019s $40 billion economy, the second-biggest in\nCentral America, is weighed down by a fiscal deficit equivalent\nto about $2 billion, approximately the amount the country earns\nfrom tourism. Central bank President Rodrigo Bolanos said in\nJanuary that as a result, economic growth will slow to 3.8\npercent this year from 4.2 percent in 2011.  The legislation\u2019s approval by Congress was the \u201cbiggest\nand most progressive\u201d fiscal agreement in the nation\u2019s history,\nFinance Minister Fernando Herrero said. Thirty-one of 50\nlegislators present voted in favor.  \u201cThis is a fundamental step to contain the risk facing the\nnational economy,\u201d Herrero said in a statement.  Given a favorable ruling by the Supreme Court, the\nlegislation would require a second approval by Congress and then\nneed presidential ratification before becoming law.  U.S. companies  Intel Corp.
