The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe 100 wealthiest people on the planet dropped $17.9 billion from their collective net worth this week after the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index fell short of hitting an all-time high.  Carlos Slim , the world\u2019s richest person, lost $5 billion during the week, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Mexican lawmakers announced legislation Monday that threatens to rein in the country\u2019s telecommunications monopolies, raising the possibility of a breakup for Slim\u2019s  America Movil SAB (AMXL) .  The stock plunged to its lowest price in almost four years. The 73-year-old is worth $67.8 billion -- $184 million ahead of  Bill Gates . The wealth gap between the billionaires is the closest it\u2019s been since the index debuted in March 2012.  \u201cIt looked like we were oh-so-close. We didn\u2019t make it and gave up some ground,\u201d said Walter \u201cBucky\u201d Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. \u201cIt\u2019s a given that we\u2019re going to get a new high on the S&P. The question is: What happens after that?\u201d  The  S&P 500  climbed Thursday to within two points of its record closing level of 1,565.15, set in October 2007, closing yesterday at 1560.70, up 0.6 percent for the week. The index has more than doubled from its bottom in 2009, fueled by corporate earnings that topped estimates and monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  set an all- time high for the eighth day in a row Thursday.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.6 percent during the week, closing at 297.44.  Gates, Icahn  Gates, the 57-year-old  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder, is the world\u2019s second-richest person with $67.6 billion.

Billionaire  Carl Icahn  was down $290 million for the week. The 77-year-old is reviewing  Dell Inc. (DELL) \u2019s books as he pushes alternatives to a proposed $24.4 billion leveraged buyout of the personal computer maker that faces mounting resistance from investors.  Icahn has amassed a stake in Dell and urged the company Monday to pay a special dividend of $9 a share. Dell\u2019s board is seeking bids higher than the $13.65 a share offer by Chief Executive Officer  Michael Dell  and Silver Lake Management LLC to take the company private. Icahn is worth $19.8 billion.  Paulson\u2019s Staying  John Paulson , the 57-year-old billionaire hedge-fund manager who was considering a move to Puerto Rico, said he won\u2019t set up a permanent residence on the island.  \u201cIn light of the media attention surrounding a relocation to Puerto Rico, he has no plans to move to Puerto Rico,\u201d said Paulson & Co., John Paulson\u2019s hedge fund, in a statement released yesterday. \u201cWhile Mr. Paulson has considered real estate investments and has vacationed on the island, he has no plans to establish a permanent residence there.\u201d  Bloomberg News reported Monday that Paulson, a lifelong New Yorker, had been exploring a move to Puerto Rico, where a new law would eliminate taxes on gains from the money he has invested in his own hedge funds. Paulson has a $11.2 billion fortune.  The  Bloomberg Billionaires Index  takes measure of the world\u2019s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes and Bloomberg News reporting.
