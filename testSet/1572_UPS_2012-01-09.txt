The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIran\u2019s revolutionary court sentenced\na former U.S. soldier of Iranian descent to death for spying\namid rising tensions over concern the  Persian Gulf  nation may try\nto close the Strait of Hormuz if Western sanctions are imposed.  The court found Amir Mirzaei Hekmati guilty of\ncollaborating \u201cwith a hostile country and spying for the\nCentral Intelligence Agency,\u201d Iran\u2019s state-controlled Fars news\nagency said, citing its reporter.  Hekmati, who was born in  Arizona  in 1983, said he joined\nthe U.S. military in 2001 after completing high school,\naccording to an earlier report by Fars. Iranian state television\nbroadcast video images of him last month.  The sentencing comes as the European Union discusses\nimposing a ban on Iranian oil imports due to the country\u2019s\nnuclear program when the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers meet on Jan.\n30. Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi said Dec. 27\nthat his nation would block oil shipments through the  Strait of\nHormuz , a transit point for a fifth of the world\u2019s crude, if\nsanctions are imposed, the   Islamic Republic News Agency  said.  Crude oil for February delivery rose as much as 59 cents to\n$102.15 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York\nMercantile Exchange  and was at $101.66 at 9:41 a.m. London time.\nThe contract fell 0.3 percent on Jan. 6 to $101.56, the lowest\nclose since Dec. 30, and has risen 2.9 percent this year.  The U.K.\u2019s Royal Navy said today it\u2019s deploying one of its\nmost modern destroyers, HMS Daring, to the Persian Gulf in a\n\u201clong planned\u201d and \u201croutine\u201d replacement of another ship.  Blocking Strait  The move is not in reaction to developments in relation to\n Iran , a navy spokesman, who declined to be identified in line\nwith government policy, said in a telephone interview today,\nconfirming a report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.  Iran has the ability to block the Strait of Hormuz \u201cfor a\nperiod of time,\u201d and the U.S. would take action to reopen it,\nU.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman General Martin Dempsey said\nin an interview aired yesterday on the CBS \u201cFace the Nation\u201d\nprogram.  An Iranian blockade could disrupt world trade in goods as\ncompanies divert ships from the Persian Gulf to safer regions.\nSuch a move could force companies including Ford Motor Co.,  BASF\nSE (BAS)  and Caterpillar Inc. to seek safer routes for transporting\nitems including car parts and chemicals, John Manners-Bell,\nchief executive officer of Transport Intelligence Ltd., a\nWiltshire, England-based logistics consultant, said Jan. 5.  \u2018Any Reason\u2019  \u201cIf for any reason the strait were closed it would have a\nhuge impact on the economy in the  Middle East  and would cause a\nsystematic restructuring of flows of goods around the world,\u201d\nManners-Bell, who used to manage European marketing at  United\nParcel Service Inc. (UPS) , said by phone.  A pipeline that would allow crude oil from the  United Arab\nEmirates  to bypass the Strait of Hormuz separating it from Iran\nhas been delayed because of construction difficulties, two\npeople with knowledge of the matter said.  As many as 270 construction issues have pushed back the\ncompletion date, said the two people, declining to be identified\nbecause they\u2019re not allowed to speak publicly on the matter. The\n$3.3 billion project won\u2019t be ready until at least April, one of\nthem said.  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAndrew J.
