 "context": "The following article called 'Proview Scrap Piles Rise While Waiting on Apple Cash Infusion' was published on 2012-03-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAs workers stream from factories in\nShatou Jiao Free Trade Zone, none emerge from Proview Technology\n(Shenzhen) Co.\u2019s green-glass and white-tile plant.  A walk round back tells the reason. The mothballed south\nChina factory of what was once the world\u2019s fourth-biggest maker\nof computer monitors is being dismantled for scrap.  Almost a year and a half since Proview Shenzhen shut after\nmissing payments to suppliers and banks, the company teeters on\nbankruptcy. Founder Rowell Yang and creditors led by  Bank of\nChina  Ltd. are now wringing out Proview\u2019s last possession of\nvalue: rights to the iPad trademark in China that  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \nwants and may have to dip into its $98 billion cash pile to get.  \u201cThe creditors hope that Proview Shenzhen can be renewed\nand restart production,\u201d Roger Xie, an attorney for the\ncompany, said in a March 2 interview at his office in downtown\nShenzhen. \u201cProview Shenzhen has two hopes. One is to transfer\nor license the trademark. The other is for Apple to compensate\nthem and purchase the trademark to give Proview Shenzhen the\nability to clear its debts.\u201d  Apple last week appealed a Shenzhen court ruling that its\n2009 purchase of the iPad trademark in China from a Taiwan\nsister company of Proview was invalid. Consumers in  China \nassociate the iPad name with Apple\u2019s tablet, and it would be\nunfair to give Proview the value of that trademark which Apple\ncreated, the Cupertino, California-based company told the Higher\nPeople\u2019s Court of Guangdong.  Apple may unveil a new iPad tablet in the U.S. today.  Proview, which began selling its own product called the\niPAD in 2000, shuttered its Shenzhen factory in November 2010.\nIn contrast with the building\u2019s facade, shattered windows scar\nthe back, and rubbish is strewn on the yard.  Scrap Piles  During a March 2 visit, workers wearing blue dust-masks\nappeared from time to time to augment two towering piles of\nscrap in what used to be a loading bay. Metal sheets, pipes and\ntubes protruded from the heaps.  \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d said Yang, when asked whether the factory\nwas being gutted, in a March 5 telephone interview. \u201cThe Banks\nhave taken over the assets, and can sell them.\u201d  Proview peaked at 10 percent of the global monitor market\nin 2006, when they ranked No. 4, said Alberto Moel, a Hong Kong-\nbased analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  \u201cThey could have at that point sustained themselves but\nthey missed the window,\u201d Moel said. \u201cCompetitors ramped\nproduction and took share. They blew up, but for a while, they\nactually were somebody.\u201d  Community Pillar  Proview\u2019s plant is a half-hour car ride due east of Xie\u2019s\noffice, along an expressway that tunnels through rolling green\nhills. Exiting the highway, a winding road curves down the\nhillside, around a hairpin turn before emerging into the heart\nof Yantian district, across the border from  Hong Kong .  Yantian was formally established in 1998, and is home to\nmore than 200,000 people and a deep-water port, as well as the\nShatou Jiao Free Trade Zone, according to the local government\u2019s\nwebsite.  Within four blocks of entering the district, visitors pass\nthe Yantian People\u2019s Court, where dozens of creditors sued\nProview. Xie declines to give the exact number, saying only it\nwas \u201c20, 30, 50\u201d or more. Those cases ultimately led to the\nYantian court-monitored arbitration that put an eight-bank group\nin control of Proview Shenzhen\u2019s assets from March 2009.  At the courthouse, two guards at the door ask numerous\ntimes \u201cAre you with Apple?\u201d And again, even after a\ngovernment-issued press card is produced.  Court Documents  After finally gaining entry, an official who refused to\nidentify himself during two hours of negotiations for access to\ncourt documents, said that records of suits involving Proview\nand its creditors are not available to the public.  Xie also declined to provide the documents.  Proview is well regarded in the community as one of its\nbest-known exporters, according to Yang. The willingness of\ncreditors to allow the company to reorganize its debt rather\nthan push it into bankruptcy was because of intervention by the\nShenzhen municipal government, which asked the banks to help in\nFebruary 2009, he said.  Proview\u2019s special place can be seen on every street. While\nthere are many businesses in the trade zone, including Ritech\nTechnology, Spectrum Quality Toys and Europtronic, Proview is\nthe only one identified on tourist information maps posted by\nthe district government along its tree-lined streets.  Proview first set up a factory there in 1992, moving into\nits current premises in 1998, a year after the company\u2019s Hong\nKong initial public offering, share sale documents show.\nRelative newcomer Apple opened its first store in China in 2008.\nLiu Zixian, a former director of the Shatou Jiao zone, was\nappointed to the board of Proview in 2004,  filings  show.  Plans to Restart  The Shenzhen plant was one of four factories of Hong Kong-\nlisted  Proview International Holdings Ltd. (334)  A lighting and audio\nproducts unit in Wuhan is the only one now operating, Yang said.  \u201cWe are trying to restructure and get an injection of\ncapital,\u201d Yang said. \u201cWe are working with an investor on\ndifferent plans, including both with a settlement payment, and\nwith no settlement payment. It\u2019s very complicated, but we still\nhope to restart production.\u201d  The Higher People\u2019s Court of Guangdong is to give its\njudgment on Apple\u2019s appeal within three months.  \u201cIf somehow for whatever reason the iPad case settles in\ntheir favor and they have some money to invest, the last thing\nI\u2019d invest it in is the business they were in,\u201d said\nBernstein\u2019s Moel. \u201cThe industry has moved on without them. It\u2019s\nmore concentrated, less profitable and more competitive.\u201d  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:\nEdmond Lococo in Beijing at \n elococo@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nMichael Tighe at \n mtighe4@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 16.325454711914062 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
