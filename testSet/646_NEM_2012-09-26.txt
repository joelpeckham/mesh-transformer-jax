 "context": "The following article called 'Gold May Hit $2,500 in 3 Years as Banks Buy, Newmont Says' was published on 2012-09-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGold may rise to $2,500 an ounce in\nthree years as investors buy the metal as a hedge against\ninflation, said  Richard O\u2019Brien , chief executive officer of\n Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the second-biggest producer by sales.  Demand from central banks on price dips will probably help\ncreate a floor for gold prices at around $1,600, O\u2019Brien, 58,\nsaid in a phone interview yesterday from Las Vegas, where he\u2019s\nattending the MINExpo conference.  \u201cThe downside is fairly limited,\u201d the CEO of the\n Greenwood Village , Colorado-based company said. \u201cIf we see some\neconomic growth we could see $2,500 in the next three or four\nyears.\u201d A global economic recession would be negative for all\ncommodities, including gold, O\u2019Brien said.  Gold has risen for 11 straight years, reaching a record\n$1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6, 2011, in  New York  as investors\nadd to holdings using exchange-traded products and central banks\nexpand reserves. O\u2019Brien said in September 2011 that gold may\nreach $2,000 an ounce by the end of that year and $2,300 by the\nend of 2012.  Central banks and the  International Monetary Fund  were the\nlargest bullion owners with 29,500 metric tons at the end of\nlast year, or 17 percent of all mined metal, World Gold Council\ndata show.  O\u2019Brien said central banks will probably purchase at\nleast 450 tons of gold next year as they buy the metal to\ndiversify reserves and protect against inflation.  Central banks bought 254.2 tons in the first half of 2012\nand may add almost 500 tons for the full year, the London-based\nWorld Gold Council said last month.  Kazakh Reserves  Kazakhstan expanded its  gold reserves  for a 13th\nconsecutive month in August, buying 1.4 metric tons, data on the\nIMF\u2019s website showed. South Korea bought 16 tons in July, and\nParaguay purchased 7.5 tons that month, the data show.  Gold for December delivery fell 1 percent to $1,748.70 at\n9:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Gold futures have risen 11\npercent this year. The metal will average $1,772 in 2013, $1,652\nin 2014 and $1,540 in 2015, according to the median of analysts\u2019\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cWe are just in the middle of what will continue to be a\nvery  bull market  for gold coming into the future,\u201d O\u2019Brien said\nin a Sept. 24 speech at the Las Vegas conference. The metal is\ntrading \u201cmore like a currency than like a commodity.\u201d  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , based in Toronto, is the biggest gold\nproducer.
