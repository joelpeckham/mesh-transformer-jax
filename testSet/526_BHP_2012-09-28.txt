The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd.\ndropped plans to buy a 30 percent stake in Mongolian coal\nexporter  Winsway Coking Coal Holding Ltd. (1733)  for HK$2.39 billion\n($308 million), its second failed acquisition this month.  The agreement was terminated because it won\u2019t be able to\nget approval from governments and regulators by a Sept. 30\ndeadline, the aluminum producer known as Chalco said in a\nstatement to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. Mongolia\npassed a law this year restricting foreign state-owned companies\nfrom controlling key assets.  Yesterday\u2019s decision is the second time this month Beijing-\nbased Chalco has abandoned a bid for a Mongolian coal miner\nbecause it wasn\u2019t able to get regulatory approvals. The company\nsaid on Sept. 3 it terminated a C$925 million ($941 million)\noffer for a stake in  SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ)   Foreign companies seeking more than 49 percent of strategic\nassets in  Mongolia  need approval from Parliament, according to a\nstatement on the government\u2019s website in May. The restriction\nmeans Mongolia joins Indonesia and Argentina in seeking to\ncontrol ownership of resource assets to secure its economic\nfuture.  Chalco, China\u2019s largest aluminum producer, proposed in\nApril to become Winsway\u2019s biggest shareholder by buying about\n1.1 billion shares at HK$2.12 apiece from the company\u2019s\nchairman. Winsway said in a separate Hong Kong stock exchange\nfiling yesterday that the share sale was abandoned on Sept. 28\nbecause the deal wouldn\u2019t get government approvals on time.  Coal Prices  Chalco was seeking coal and iron-ore assets after  profit \nfrom its mining unit fell 67 percent last year on higher raw\nmaterial and power costs.  Metallurgical-coal prices have tumbled this year as\nmanufacturing in China, the world\u2019s biggest steelmaker,\ncontracted at the fastest pace since March 2009 and mines in\n Australia  resumed output after flooding halted operations last\nyear.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world\u2019s biggest coking coal\nexporter, settled the fourth-quarter benchmark contract for the\nfuel at $170 a metric ton, 40 percent less than a year earlier,\nDoyle Trading Consultants LLC said on Sept. 12.
