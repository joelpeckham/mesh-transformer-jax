The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied below 3-1/2 year highs on Monday as resistance emerged in Europe and Asia to U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran, while rising U.S. drilling pointed to higher North American production.\nA burn-off flare is seen at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation's (CPS) Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery in Colombo, Sri Lanka May 11, 2018. REUTERS/ Dinuka Liyanawatte/Files Brent crude was up 20 cents at $77.32 a barrel by 1315 GMT and U.S. light crude rose 10 cents to $70.80.\nBoth oil futures contracts hit their highest since November 2014 last week at $78 and $71.89 a barrel respectively as markets anticipated a sharp fall in Iranian crude supply once U.S. sanctions bite later this year.\nIt is unclear how hard U.S. sanctions will hit Iran\u2019s oil industry. A lot will depend on how other major oil consumers respond to Washington\u2019s action against Tehran, which will take effect in November.\nChina, France, Russia, Britain, Germany and Iran all remain in the nuclear accord that placed controls on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme and led to a relaxation of economic sanctions against Iran and companies doing business there.\nSome oil analysts have said they expect Iranian crude exports to fall by as little as 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), while others put the figure closer to 1 million bpd.\nMichael Wittner, analyst at Societe Generale, forecasts U.S. sanctions will remove 400,000-500,000 bpd of Iranian crude from the global oil market.\n\u201cIn 2012 the reduction in Iranian crude production and exports was around 1 million bpd,\u201d Wittner said. \u201cThis time around, we expect much less of an impact.\u201d\nGreg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader, says it is still \u201cfar from certain\u201d that sanctions \u201cwill bite in the way intended\u201d.\n\u201cGermany has said it will protect its companies from U.S. sanctions, Iran has said French oil giant Total has yet to pull out of its fields and all the while it seems the Chinese are ready to fill the void created by the U.S.\u201d\nThe surge in oil prices comes at a time of tight supply amid record Asian demand and voluntary output restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers including Russia.\nOn Monday, however, markets were held in check by news of a rise in U.S. drilling for new oil production.\nU.S. drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to May 11, bringing the total to 844, the highest level since March 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.\n\u201cSoaring U.S. shale output will continue to put a cap on prices,\u201d said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at futures brokerage FXTM.\nAdditional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by David Goodman\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was 123.98999786376953 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. was ",
