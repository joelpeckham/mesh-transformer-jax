On this news, HSBC's American depositary receipt price has fallen sharply during intraday trading on February 20, 2018.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
