 "context": "The following article called 'Wall Street\u2019s Ways Make Jury Selection Tricky: Ann Woolner' was published on 2011-02-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA hedge-fund billionaire who soon\nwill face a jury wants to know whether people hate  Wall Street .\nOf course they do, and no wonder:  A money manager stands charged with threatening to kill\nregulators.  Attorneys collecting money for victims of  Bernard Madoff \naccuse hedge-fund honchos of knowingly profiting from his  Ponzi\nscheme . Citibank, HSBC Holdings and Bank of America\u2019s Merrill\nLynch unit knew or should have known Madoff was a crook, say the\nlawyers, led by trustee  Irving Picard . JPMorgan Chase \u201caided\nand abetted\u201d the scheme, they say in a lawsuit the bank calls\n\u201cmeritless.\u201d The other companies deny complicity, too.  In  bankruptcy court , all sorts of creditors, including\nother banks, are suing Lehman Brothers Holdings, claiming it\ncheated them out of millions of dollars. Lehman says it\u2019s the\nvictim, not the perp.  And every few days, yet another financial whiz or business\nexpert pleads guilty to  insider trading .  Meantime, Wall Street geniuses whose reckless greed and\nunregulated schemes sent the country into an economic tailspin\ntake home million-dollar bonuses while Americans lose their jobs\nand their homes because of the crisis.  So it\u2019s easy to understand why Raj Rajaratnam might have\ntrouble finding 12 sentient adults who don\u2019t have a sour view of\nhim and his kind. The co-founder of Galleon Group LLC heads to\ntrial in  Manhattan  on Feb. 28, charged with insider trading.  Here\u2019s one of the questions his lawyers want to ask\npotential jurors: \u201cDo today\u2019s Wall Street executives lack\nintegrity?\u201d  Are they kidding? Do they really want to know the depth and\nbreadth of public distrust of Wall Street?  Five-Point Scale  To try to keep that sort of bias out of the jury box, this\nweek they proposed to the judge a 15-page questionnaire for\nprospective jurors that contain questions such as, \u201cHow honest\ndo you think Wall Street executives are?\u201d Answers would be\ngiven on a five-point scale, from \u201cnot at all honest\u201d to\n\u201cextremely honest.\u201d  They probably aren\u2019t going to like what they find.  An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll last May  found  that 58\npercent of Americans believe \u201ccorporate corruption and broker\npractices\u201d make markets unfair. A mere 35 percent believed\n\u201cthe stock market is a fair and open way to invest one\u2019s\nmoney.\u201d  I\u2019m surprised trust in Wall Street was even that high.  There may have been worse times for an accused white-collar\ncriminal to come to trial, like after the 2001 and 2002\ncollapses of Enron, WorldCom and the rest. But this isn\u2019t a\ngreat time either.  Juror Test  It won\u2019t be possible for Rajaratnam\u2019s lawyers to insulate\nthe jury box from that kind of sentiment. Even would-be jurors\nwho admit harboring \u201cstrong\u201d negative views about Wall Street,\nas the questionnaire puts it, wouldn\u2019t be automatically\neliminated.  The test is whether they can set those views aside to base\na verdict strictly on the evidence at trial. Few people will\nadmit that they can\u2019t be fair. But when judges are convinced\nthat would-be jurors are too biased, they can kick them out of\nthe pool for cause.  On the other hand, when a judge declines to excuse an iffy\npanelist, it falls to the lawyers to decide what to do. The\ndefense can boot such a person out by using one of the 10\n\u201c peremptory \u201d strikes. If the jury pool contains more than 10\njurors whose views worry the defense, lawyers will have to\nchoose which ones concern them most.  (Prosecutors get six such challenges. They\u2019ll be hunting\nfor people too sympathetic to Wall Street.)  Enron Experience  When former Enron chief executives  Jeffrey Skilling  and  Kenneth Lay  stood trial in Houston, the hometown of the\ncompany\u2019s rise and demise, their lawyers tried to weed out\npotential jurors who displayed the sort of anti-Enron sentiment\nthat seemed to pervade the city.  One said she had lost $50,000 to $60,000 on Enron, but the\njudge kept her in the pool until a defense lawyer removed her.  During argument over Skilling\u2019s appeal last year, U.S.\nSupreme Court Justice  Stephen Breyer  said he counted anywhere\nfrom three to six potential jurors who admitted bias, yet the\njudge didn\u2019t dismiss them from the pool and often didn\u2019t\nsufficiently question them.  Still, the high court ruled 6-3 that pre-trial prejudice\nwasn\u2019t grounds for reversing Skilling\u2019s conviction. (Breyer was\none of the three dissenters.)  Bear Stearns Case  At any rate, prosecutors can\u2019t rely on juror prejudice to\ncarry their case. Some jurors who acquitted two Bear Stearns\nhedge-fund managers in 2009 said afterwards that that\u2019s exactly\nwhat prosecutors were attempting, and they didn\u2019t much like it.  The defendants,  Ralph Cioffi  and Matthew Tannin, \u201cwere\nscapegoats for Wall Street\u201d juror Serphaine Stimpson said\nafterwards.  When the Rajaratnam trial opens, both sides will try to\nseat a jury favorably predisposed to their claims. Given the\ntimes, and the long list of Wall Streeters gone bad, that will\nbe harder for the defense than for prosecutors.    Ann Woolner  is a Bloomberg News columnist.
