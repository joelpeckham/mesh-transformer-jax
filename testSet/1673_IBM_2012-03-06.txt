 "context": "The following article called 'IBM\u2019s Watson Gets Wall Street Job After \u2018Jeopardy\u2019 Win' was published on 2012-03-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInternational Business Machines\nCorp. (IBM) \u2019s Watson computer, which beat champions of the quiz show\n\u201cJeopardy!\u201d a year ago, will soon be advising Wall Street on\nrisks, portfolios and clients.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest U.S. lender, is Watson\u2019s\nfirst financial services client, IBM said yesterday. It will\nhelp analyze customer needs and process financial, economic and\nclient data to advance and personalize digital banking.  IBM expects to generate billions in new revenue by 2015 by\nputting Watson to work. The technology giant has already sold\nWatson to health-care clients, helping  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  and Seton\nHealth Family analyze data to improve care. IBM executives say\nWatson\u2019s  skills  -- understanding and processing natural\nlanguage, consulting vast volumes of unstructured information,\nand accurately answering questions with humanlike cognition --\nare also well suited for the finance industry.  Financial services is the \u201cnext big one for us,\u201d said\nManoj Saxena, the man responsible for finding Watson work. IBM\nis confident that with a little training, the quiz-show star\nthat can read and understand 200 million pages in three seconds\ncan make money for IBM by helping financial firms identify\nrisks, rewards and customer wants mere human experts may\noverlook.  Banks spent about $400 billion on  information technology \nlast year, said  Michael Versace , head of risk research at\nInternational Data Corp.\u2019s Financial Insights, which has done\nresearch for IBM.  Cloud-Based Service  Watson the financial assistant will be delivered as a\ncloud-based service and earn a percentage of the additional\nrevenue and cost savings it is able to help financial\ninstitutions realize. Watson, including its work in the health-\ncare and finance industries, will contribute \u201ca portion\u201d of\nIBM\u2019s  target  of $16 billion of analytics revenues in 2015,\nSaxena said, and that portion will \u201chave a B next to it.\u201d  Watson may add $2.65 billion in revenue in 2015, adding 52\ncents of earnings per share,  Ed Maguire , an analyst at CLSA in\n New York , estimated in a November research note.  IBM, the world\u2019s biggest computer-services provider,\nreported  revenue  of $107 billion in 2011 and earnings of $13.06\na share. The company ended 2011 with $11.9 billion in cash.  IBM shares closed above $200 for the first time yesterday,\nfactoring in stock splits. The stock fell 1.7 percent to $197.26\nat the close in New York today.  Language of Wall Street  Watson \u201ccan give an edge\u201d in finance, said  Stephen Baker ,\n author  of books The Numerati and Final Jeopardy, a Watson\nbiography. \u201cIt can go through newspaper articles, documents,\nSEC filings, and try to make some sense out of them, put them\ninto a context banks are interested in, like risk.\u201d  In addition to Citigroup, Armonk, New York-based IBM has\nbeen working with financial institutions teaching Watson the\nlanguage of  Wall Street , and adding content including regulatory\nannouncements, news and social media feeds. IBM won\u2019t say which\nother institutions Watson is already working with.  \u201cIt\u2019s not selling them software, it\u2019s selling them\noutcomes,\u201d Saxena said in a phone interview.  Watson offers a \u201cmore global\u201d picture by looking beyond\nfinancial data, Saxena said. For example, Watson can comb 10-Ks,\nprospectuses, loan performances and earnings quality while also\nuncovering sentiment and news not in the usual metrics before\noffering securities portfolio recommendations. It can also\nmonitor trading, news sources and  Facebook (FB)  to help a treasurer\nmanage foreign exchange risk.  \u2018Huge Marketing Edge\u2019  Some of the biggest financial institutions have already\nbuilt big data centers. IBM is competing with most other major\ntechnology companies to sell them tools to analyze and use\naccumulated information, Versace said.  \u201cApparently Citi gets it -- analytics is the new core in\ncompetitive banking,\u201d Versace said. \u201cThe ability to\nefficiently and effectively exploit big data, advanced modeling,\ntext analytics, in memory and real-time decisions across\nchannels and operations will distinguish those that thrive in\nuncertain and uneven markets, from those that fumble.\u201d  Watson gives IBM \u201ca huge marketing edge\u201d in the race\namong tech giants including Google Inc. and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  to\nobtain intelligence for businesses by teaching machines to\nunderstand sentences and paragraphs rather than searching for\nsingle words or phrases, said author Baker.  Parts of Watson could already be combined with other IBM\ntechnologies to help banks with regulatory compliance by\nsurveying internal documents and flagging those that seem amiss,\nBaker said. Watson was designed to be loaded with information\nrather than grapple with a live streaming feed, making it likely\nIBM will partner it with other technologies.  Applications Beyond Banking  Beyond banks and other financial institutions, and\ninsurance companies, Watson may have applications for\ntelecommunications companies, and perhaps even call centers,\nsaid Saxena, who joined IBM when it acquired his company Webify\nSolutions Inc. in 2006.  IBM plans to use Watson in financial services \u201cmostly for\nportfolio risk management, they\u2019re not going to do stock\npicking,\u201d CLSA\u2019s Maguire said in a Feb. 17 phone interview.\n\u201cThey think that Watson can make a difference.\u201d Still, Watson\nisn\u2019t perfect. It is weak in languages other than English, and\nits processing of social media streams from platforms including\nFacebook and Twitter can be sluggish. The lag is \u201cgetting\nshorter\u201d, Saxena said.  Precise Answers  A year ago last month, about 15 million viewers watched\nWatson beat former Jeopardy champions Ken Jennings and Brad\nRutter -- a highly publicized victory in artificial intelligence\nthat IBM always aimed to apply to the business world.  Watson had to learn how people speak and write, and\nevaluate its level of understanding, said  Eric Brown , a member\nof the team that built him in an IBM research facility in New\nYork. Precise answers delivered with confidence distinguish\nWatson from Web searches, enabling the technology to advise\nreal-life decision makers, Brown said.  \u201cI\u2019m sure they use all this stuff internally to manage\ntheir own portfolio,\u201d said CLSA\u2019s Maguire. \u201cIBM\u2019s treasury is\nbigger than a lot of trading desks. If they went into asset\nmanagement they would kick ass, but that\u2019s not what they do.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nBeth Jinks in New York at \n bjinks1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nPeter Elstrom at   pelstrom@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was 134.52459716796875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was ",
