 "context": "The following article called 'Sinopec's Third-Quarter Profit Beats Estimates as China Fuel Demand Rises' was published on 2010-10-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina Petroleum & Chemical Corp. ,\nAsia\u2019s biggest refiner, posted a 15 percent gain in third-\nquarter profit, beating estimates, as faster industrial\nproduction growth boosted fuel consumption by factories.  Net income  at Sinopec, as China Petroleum is known, rose to\n19.6 billion yuan ($2.9 billion), or 0.224 yuan a share, from a\nrevised 17.1 billion yuan, or 0.197 yuan, a year earlier, the\ncompany said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange\ntoday. That compares with a mean estimate of 18.16 billion yuan\nin a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts.  Manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace in four months\nin September, adding to signs that economic growth is\nstabilizing even as the government curbs increases in lending\nand takes steps to cool the property market. China imported a\nrecord amount of crude oil last month to meet demand in the\nworld\u2019s fastest-growing major economy.  \u201cSinopec, among other energy producers in China, will\ncontinue to benefit from increasing domestic demand over the\nlong run,\u201d Yin Xiaodong, a Beijing-based energy analyst with\nCitic Securities Co., said by telephone.  China overtook the U.S. last year as the biggest automobile\nmarket and Germany as the largest exporter. Domestic automobile\nsales may exceed 17 million units this year, increasing fuel\nrequirements, the National Energy Administration said this week.  Shares of  Sinopec  have risen 7.7 percent in Hong Kong\ntrading this year, compared with a 6.1 percent gain in the\nbenchmark Hang Seng index. The stock advanced 0.7 percent to\nclose at HK$7.44 today, before the earnings announcement.  Full-Year Profit  Full-year net income may rise 1 percent to 64.43 billion\nyuan, according to a mean estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg.  The Beijing-based company will build up its exploration and\nproduction business to counter the risks in refining, Chairman\nSu Shulin said on Aug. 23.  Sinopec\u2019s earnings growth may lag behind domestic rivals\n PetroChina Co.  and Cnooc Ltd. because of its greater exposure to\nthe production and sales of fuels whose prices are capped by the\nstate, according to analysts including Gordon Kwan, head of\nregional energy research at Mirae Asset Securities Ltd.  Crude in New York averaged $76.21 a barrel in the July to\nSeptember period compared with $68.24 a barrel a year earlier.\nThe government increased fuel prices by about 3 percent this\nmonth and as much as 4.6 percent in April.  Sinopec, which gets 80 percent of its revenue from\nproducing and distributing fuels, may step up acquisitions of\noil and gas fields to diversify from refining. The company\nagreed in March to buy a share in an Angolan field from its\nparent, China Petrochemical Corp., for $2.5 billion. The parent\nagreed this month to pay $7.1 billion for a stake in Repsol YPF\nSA\u2019s Brazilian unit.  Chinese companies spent a record $32 billion last year\nacquiring energy and resources assets overseas to meet domestic\ndemand. Cnooc, China\u2019s biggest offshore oil explorer, agreed in\nMarch to buy a 50 percent stake in Argentine producer Bridas\nCorp. for $3.1 billion. PetroChina won in December Canadian\ngovernment approval to purchase a stake in two Alberta oil-sands\nprojects for C$1.9 billion ($1.9 billion).
