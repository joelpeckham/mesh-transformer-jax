Wilson, agreed to buy some of Petro-Hunt LLC\u2019s North\nDakota fields for about $1.45 billion in cash and stock.  Petro-Hunt, a closely held company owned by the Hunt\nfamily, and an affiliated entity will get $700 million in cash\nand $750 million in shares, Houston-based Halcon said in a\nstatement today. The purchase includes about 81,000 net acres in\nfour North Dakota counties with current net production\nequivalent to more than 10,500 barrels of oil a day.  The acquisition is the fourth and largest for Halcon, the\nSpanish word for falcon, since it was formed in November 2011.\nWilson, who sold Petrohawk for $12.1 billion to  BHP Billiton\nLtd. (BHP)  in August 2011, has said he will also eventually sell\nHalcon, which has a $1.52 billion market valuation. The company\nwill focus on developing fields and isn\u2019t looking at more big\ndeals, Wilson said today on a conference call with analysts.  \u201cThis hawk is ready to soar,\u201d said Wilson, Halcon\u2019s\nchairman and chief executive officer. \u201cWe\u2019ll have grown from an\nidea into a well-staffed  oil company  producing over 25,000\nbarrels of oil equivalent per day with the closing of this\ntransaction.\u201d  Halcon rose 1.6 percent to $7.18 at the close in New York.  Capital Spending  With the purchase, Halcon is more than doubling its land\nholdings in the Bakken and Three Forks formations in  North\nDakota  and Montana. North Dakota oil production reached a  record \nof 701,134 barrels a day in August, up 3.7 percent from the\nprior month. The assets in today\u2019s agreement hold reserves\nestimated at the equivalent of 42.4 million barrels of oil.  Petro-Hunt will own about 22 percent of Halcon after the\ndeal closes, which is expected in December, according to the\ncompany. Halcon will finance the cash portion by selling $300\nmillion of stock at $7.16 a share to the Canada Pension Plan\nInvestment Board and with bank borrowings, according to the\nstatement.  Halcon expects to expand its planned $1.1 billion capital\nspending plan by $300 million to accelerate drilling and extend\npipelines in the area, Wilson said.
