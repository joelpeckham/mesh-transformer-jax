 "context": "The following article called 'Mexico Inflation Breached Target in January as Drought Costs Rose: Economy' was published on 2012-02-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMexico \u2019s  inflation rate  surpassed the\nupper limit of the central bank\u2019s target range for the first\ntime since 2010, leaving policy makers little room to lower\nborrowing costs this year to help stimulate the economy.  Annual inflation in January quickened at the fastest pace\nsince December 2010 to 4.05 percent, exceeding all 14 estimates\nof economists surveyed by Bloomberg. From a month earlier,\nprices rose 0.71 percent, the national statistics institute said\non its website  today . The monthly figure exceeded all 18\nestimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Mexico\u2019s inflation rate has risen four months in a row as\nthe worst drought on record pushes up costs for staples such as\ntortillas, tomatoes and beef. With the U.S. economy\nstrengthening, and price increases expected to breach the 4\npercent upper limit of the central bank\u2019s target range for\nseveral months, analysts don\u2019t hold much hope for a rate cut.  \u201cThis makes it difficult for the central bank to have a\nmore relaxed monetary policy in the short term,\u201d said  Rafael Camarena , a Mexico City-based economist at  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,\nwhose current call is for rates to decrease in March. \u201cIn the\ncoming weeks, we have to review our forecast to see if we will\ncontinue with a cut in March or not.\u201d  U.S. stocks were little changed, a day after the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index rallied to a seven-month high, as investors\nweighed an agreement by Greek political leaders on measures\nneeded to secure rescue funds.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent to 1,348.93 as of 10:58 a.m.\nNew York time. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 7.19\npoints, or 0.1 percent, to 12876.76 today.  Growth, Inflation  Elsewhere today, U.K. manufacturing jumped in December by\nfive times as much as economists forecast and the total trade\ndeficit shrank to the smallest since 2003. Factory output\nincreased 1 percent from the previous month, while the  trade gap \nin goods and services narrowed by more than half to 1.11 billion\npounds ($1.7 billion).  China \u2019s inflation unexpectedly accelerated in January on\nincreased spending from a weeklong holiday, limiting room for\nmonetary easing as  Europe \u2019s debt crisis damps exports and the\nproperty market cools. Prices rose 4.5 percent from a year\nearlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on its website.  Speaking last night in the nation\u2019s capital, Mexico\u2019s\nFinance Minister Jose Antonio Meade played down the impact of\nthe drought, saying inflation is under control.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on the horizon that makes us think that\ninflationary targets are at risk,\u201d Meade said at an event in\nMexico City. \u201cThe drought has not yet had a strong impact in\nproduction regions. Its impact has been contained.\u201d  Food, Tradable Goods  Food, beverages and tobacco account for 23 percent of the\ninflation basket measured by the statistics institute, according\nto data from  Citigroup Inc.\u2019s Banamex (BANAMEX)  unit. Elsewhere in Latin\nAmerica, the weighting of food in consumer price indexes ranges\nfrom 18.9 percent in  Chile  to 39 percent in  Peru .  The peso traded at 12.7291 per  U.S. dollar  at 9:58 a.m.\nMexico City time, down 0.1 percent from yesterday.  The yield on government fixed-rate peso debt due in\nDecember 2013 rose 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to\n4.745 per cent at 9:59 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The price of the securities fell 0.05\ncentavo to 105.76 centavos per peso.  Mexicans paid 3.23 percent more for agricultural and\nlivestock prices from a month earlier, which economists see as a\nsign that the drought in the northern region is driving up\nprices. Tradable goods rose 0.85 percent, a category economists\nassociate with last year\u2019s peso slump passing through to costs.  Inflation \u2018Temporary\u2019  Core prices, which exclude food and energy, gained 0.45\npercent in January, more than the 0.40 percent median estimate\nof 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  It is too soon to move up calls for the central bank to\nraise  interest rates  based on January\u2019s inflation figure, said\nDelia Paredes, chief economist at Grupo Financiero Banorte, in\nMexico City.  \u201cIt\u2019s temporary and due to the drought,\u201d Paredes said.\n\u201cAlthough we are seeing relatively good economic activity for\nthe first half of the year, the second half could decelerate and\nI think that will help inflation remain at 4 percent.\u201d  The central bank, led by Governor Agustin Carstens, on Jan.\n20 kept the benchmark rate at 4.5 percent for a 24th consecutive\nmeeting, saying \u201cthe current monetary policy posture is\nconducive to reaching the permanent inflation target,\u201d\naccording to the meeting\u2019s minutes.  Banco de Mexico  targets 3 percent inflation, plus or minus\none percentage point.  Divided Opinion  Board members disagreed on the risks to inflation and\neconomic growth, diverging on whether the outlook on both fronts\nhad improved or deteriorated, the minutes, published Feb. 3,\nshowed.  Economists raised their estimate for both inflation and\ngrowth this year, according to the median estimate of 22\nanalysts in a bi-weekly survey conducted by Citigroup Inc.\u2019s\nBanamex unit.  The Feb. 7 poll estimated inflation would end 2012 at 3.78\npercent, up from 3.74 percent in the previous survey, and\nforecast economic growth of 3.2 percent this year, up from 3.1\npercent previously.  Pass-Through  The survey also showed analysts expect no change in the\ncentral bank\u2019s overnight rate until March 2013, raising it 25\nbasis points, or 0.25 percentage point.  Mexico\u2019s benchmark IPC stock index has risen 3.8 percent in\nthe last month in local currency terms. Yields on government\npeso-denominated, fixed-rate bonds maturing in 2024 have fallen\neight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.596 percent\nover the same period.  While the peso has been recovering this year, an 11 percent\nslump in the currency in 2011 will still have a \u201cmild\u201d impact\non consumer prices, said  Gabriel Casillas , chief Mexico\neconomist at  JPMorgan Chase & Co .  Other possible inflation drivers are \u201chigher tortilla\nprices reflecting higher global corn prices, as well as a weak\ndomestic corn harvest because of the drought,\u201d Casillas said by\nphone Feb. 7.  Expectations  JPMorgan raised its year-end inflation forecast to 4\npercent from 3.5 percent on Feb. 3 and Banorte\u2019s Paredes\npredicted inflation will peak at 4.4 percent in June before it\nsubsides to 3.8 percent by the end of 2012.  Consumer prices have absorbed the shocks to the country\u2019s\nexchange rate \u201cvery well,\u201d central bank Deputy Governor Manuel Ramos Francia said Jan. 12. Central bank studies have shown the\nexchange rate\u2019s impact on consumer prices has been limited in\nthe past, according to the bank\u2019s minutes.  The peso has bounced back in the year to date to strengthen\n9.5 percent, the best performance against the dollar among the\n16-most traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Consumer prices for the first half of January exceeded\neconomists\u2019 expectations, rising 0.32 percent, which was higher\nthan 12 of the 16 estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nThe annual inflation rate rose to 3.82 in December, the highest\nin a year.  Growth in  Latin America \u2019s second-biggest economy will slow\nto around 3.5 percent this year from 4 percent in 2011, Finance\nMinister Meade said Jan. 5.  The central bank next meets to decide on rates March 16.
