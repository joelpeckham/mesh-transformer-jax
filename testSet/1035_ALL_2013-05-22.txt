(ALL) , the largest publicly\ntraded U.S. home and auto insurer, will retire about $3 billion\nin debt as Chief Executive Officer Thomas Wilson takes advantage\nof near record-low interest rates.  The insurer plans to repay or pre-fund $1.2 billion of debt\nmaturing this year and next, and purchase through tender offers\nportions of $4.3 billion in outstanding debt at a premium, the\nNorthbrook, Illinois-based company said today in a statement.\nThe transactions will be funded by a combination of cash,\nissuance of preferred stock and debt.  Wilson, 55, is seeking to reduce his company\u2019s cost of\ncapital as the Federal Reserve keeps borrowing costs low to help\nstimulate the U.S. economy. Allstate\u2019s $250 million of 20-year\nbonds maturing in June pay a 7.5 percent coupon. The company\u2019s\n$400 million of 5.35 percent notes due in 2033 yielded about 4\npercent on May 20, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting\nsystem of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  \u201cThe net result will be more equity in the capital\nstructure, lower capital cost and a longer maturity profile,\nwith no meaningful impact on ongoing earnings,\u201d Wilson said in\nthe statement. \u201cThese actions further enhance our strategic and\ncapital flexibility and take advantage of the current\nunprecedented low cost of these capital sources.\u201d  The transactions will reduce second-quarter earnings, the\ninsurer said in the statement, without providing a figure. The\nshare buyback plan won\u2019t be affected, the company said.  Allstate said in a separate statement today that it had\nbegun its tender for securities including the 2033 notes and\n$800 million of 5.55 percent bonds due in 2035. The offers\nexpire on June 19.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc. are acting as dealer managers for the offers.  The insurer climbed 0.8 percent to $49.45 at 11:19 a.m. in\nNew York. The company has advanced 23 percent this year.
