 "context": "The following article called 'Canada Stocks Rise as Oil Producers Offset Drop in Phone Shares' was published on 2013-09-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanadian  stocks  rose, with the\nbenchmark gauge poised for the best quarterly performance in a\nyear, as gains in consumer-staples companies and oil producers\noffset a decline in phone shares amid concern that a U.S. budget\nimpasse may shut down the government.  Trilogy Energy Corp. soared 11 percent after providing an\nupdate on its operations in  Alberta . Telus Corp. and  Rogers\nCommunications Inc. (RCI/B)  slipped at least 1 percent after an analyst\nwith Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce lowered his price\ntargets for the nation\u2019s largest wireless carriers due to\nregulatory risks.  BlackBerry (BB)  Ltd. increased 0.7 percent to snap\nthree days of losses after reporting second-quarter earnings.  The  Standard & Poor\u2019s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 2.46 points,\nor less than 0.1 percent, to 12,844.08 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The\nbenchmark Canadian equity gauge has jumped 5.9 percent this\nquarter, the biggest gain since September 2012, and is up 3.3\npercent in 2013.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anxiety going into the weekend,\u201d said\n Andrew Pyle ,  fund manager  with ScotiaMcLeod Inc. in\nPeterborough, Ontario. He manages about C$210 million ($204\nmillion). \u201cNobody should be naive out there, to think if we get\na worst-case scenario with respect to the U.S. budget impasse\nthat  Canada  comes out of this unscathed. You could see some very\nheavy losses in the TSX.\u201d  The  U.S. Senate  voted to finance the government through\nNov. 15, sending the bill to the House and setting up a weekend\nof negotiations and brinkmanship three days before federal\nspending authority runs out and a few weeks until the country\nreaches its borrowing limit.  Destabilizing Effect  President  Barack Obama  said in a televised statement that\nCongress\u2019s failure to approve funding would have a destabilizing\neffect on the economy. Democrats and Republicans can\u2019t agree on\nthe inclusion of funds for Obama\u2019s health-care law in the bill.  Energy stocks added 0.1 percent as a group, as six of 10\n industries  in the S&P/TSX rose. Trading volume was 20 percent\nbelow the 30-day average.  Trilogy Energy soared 11 percent to C$28.80 after reporting\nan operating update for its Montney and Duvernay oil projects.\nThe company said unexpected plant outages reduced third-quarter\nvolumes to about 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and\nanticipates levels returning to normal in the fourth quarter.  Athabasca Oil Corp. (ATH) , which is seeking a joint-venture\npartner for its Duvernay holdings, jumped 9.3 percent to C$7.97,\nthe most in seven weeks.  BlackBerry Earnings  BlackBerry added 0.7 percent to C$8.28, the first increase\nin six days. The smartphone maker reported more complete second-quarter  earnings , including a loss of 47 cents a share from\ncontinuing operations and a 45 percent plunge in sales to $1.57\nbillion, after disclosing preliminary results on Sept. 20.  \u201cThe slight upside likely reflects that there was nothing\nhidden in the results,\u201d said  Bill Kreher , an analyst with\nEdward Jones & Co., in a phone interview from  St. Louis .  Jean Coutu Group Inc. rose 1.8 percent to C$18.29 to pace\ngains among consumer-staples companies.  Telus dropped 1.2 percent to C$34.52 and Rogers retreated 1\npercent to C$44.64. Analyst Robert Bek with  CIBC World Markets \ncut his price targets for the two wireless carriers by 11\npercent and 17 percent, respectively, due to the Canadian\ngovernment\u2019s increasing attention to the space.  Canada\u2019s largest carriers signaled on Sept. 23 their intent\nto bid in a wireless spectrum auction in January, with no sign\nof interest from major foreign companies after Verizon\nCommunications Inc. said earlier this month it wouldn\u2019t enter\nthe Canadian market.  \u2018Emerging Trend\u2019  Teck Resources Ltd., Canada\u2019s largest diversified miner,\ndropped 4.1 percent to C$28.10 following two days of gains.\nParetosh Misra, analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the company\nmay move ahead with an oil sands project, as investing in energy\nassets is an \u201cemerging trend\u201d among miners.  Martinrea International Inc. (MRE) , a metal auto-parts maker,\nslumped 10 percent to C$10.96 after the company said it received\na press release discussing a claim from Nat Rea, former vice\nchairman of the company. Martinrea has not received the claim or\nreviewed the allegations and will \u201crespond appropriately in due\ncourse.\u201d  Rea, who was fired in June 2012, said he filed a statement\nof claim alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to\nseveral deals involving suppliers and customers and is calling\nfor a new board of directors. The claims have not been proven in\ncourt.
