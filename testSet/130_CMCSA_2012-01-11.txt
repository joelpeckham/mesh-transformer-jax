 "context": "The following article called 'Warner Bros. Faces Push-Back With Plan to Bar New DVD Rentals for 8 Weeks' was published on 2012-01-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWarner Bros ., leading a push to spur\nmovie purchases by delaying the availability of DVD rentals, is\nrunning into resistance from two of its biggest customers.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) \u2019s Blockbuster, the largest U.S. movie-\nrental chain, and  Coinstar Inc. (CSTR) , operator of the Redbox DVD\nkiosks, are pushing back against the  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  film\nunit\u2019s efforts to make consumers wait 56 days before they can\nrent the latest releases. The current delay for Redbox is 28\ndays after a DVD goes on sale to the public.  Warner Bros. is calculating the potential gains outweigh\nthe risk of alienating the retailers. While  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  is\ngoing along, Blockbuster stores are buying the studio\u2019s movies\nfrom others the day they go on sale and renting them to\ncustomers right away, according to a person with knowledge of\nthe matter who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.  \u201cAs a company that\u2019s really not focused on new releases,\nNetflix doesn\u2019t really care about a move from 28 days to 56,\u201d\nsaid  Eric Wold , a San Francisco-based analyst at B. Riley & Co.\n\u201cFor the other companies, new releases really dominate their\nrentals, so that kind of delay would really hurt them.\u201d  Coinstar, which has an agreement with Warner Bros. that\nexpires at the end of this month, hasn\u2019t agreed to lengthen its\n28-day window and has suggested it too may find alternatives.  No Revised Accord  \u201cThe current agreement Coinstar has with Warner Bros. is\nto receive movie titles 28 days after their release,\u201d Marci Maule, a spokeswoman for the Bellevue, Washington-based company,\nsaid yesterday in an e-mail, reiterating earlier statements.\n\u201cNo revised agreements are in place.\u201d  Coinstar, operator of more than 34,000 DVD-rental kiosks,\nhas \u201cworkarounds\u201d to obtain new releases if studios seek to\nimpose a longer delay, Chief Executive Officer Paul Davis said\non an Oct. 27 conference call.  Peter Binazeski, a Warner Bros. spokesman, said the company\nhad no comment on talks with Blockbuster or Coinstar.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) \u2019s Universal Pictures,  News Corp. (NWSA) \u2019s Fox and\nWarner Bros. previously made deals with Coinstar and Los Gatos,\nCalifornia-based Netflix for a 28-day delay.  Netflix, the streaming and DVD rental service, agreed with\nWarner Bros. yesterday to double the period to 56 days.  The longer window is part of an effort at Warner to get\ncustomers to buy movies rather than rent them, Mark Horak,\npresident of Warner Home Video North America, said yesterday in\nthe statement announcing the Netflix deal.  U.S. consumer spending on home-video entertainment fell 2.1\npercent to $18 billion last year, the seventh straight annual\ndecline, according to the industry-backed Digital Entertainment\nGroup.  Rental Stores  Rental revenue at stores like Blockbuster tumbled 28\npercent, the DEG said. Purchases of DVDs fell 20 percent, the\nDEG data suggest, while spending on Blu-ray discs gained 20\npercent to $2 billion. Kiosk rentals, led by Redbox, grew by 31\npercent, the DEG said.  Another part of the strategy, Horak said, is to promote\nUltraViolet, a technical standard that allows consumers to buy\nmovies online from multiple sources and watch them on a variety\nof devices, including TVs, computers and smartphones.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the largest Internet retailer, announced\nyesterday at the  Consumer Electronics Show  in  Las Vegas  that\nit is rejoining the UltraViolet initiative and will make films\npurchased by consumers accessible on devices such as its Kindle \nFire tablet.  Netflix probably is getting a reduced price on DVDs in\nreturn for waiting longer, Wold said. Before Netflix started its\nstreaming business, new releases accounted for about 30 percent\nof customer requests, he said. That percentage probably declined\nwhen streaming was introduced.  \u201cThey always push consumers toward catalog titles\nanyway,\u201d Wold said.  Dish, which bought Blockbuster out of bankruptcy in April,\ngained 0.3 percent to $28.88 yesterday at the close in  New York .\nCoinstar advanced 2.3 percent to $44.18, while Time Warner added\n0.4 percent to $36.97. Netflix declined 2.4 percent to $95.83.
