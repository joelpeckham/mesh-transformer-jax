 "context": "The following article called 'Myriad\u2019s Human-Gene Patent Rehearing Ordered by High Court' was published on 2012-03-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  U.S. Supreme Court (1000L)  ordered a\nlower court to revisit whether human genes can be patented in\nlight of the justices March 20 decision that limited the ability\nto obtain legal protection for some diagnostic medical tests.  The justices today ordered the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for\nthe Federal Circuit to reconsider its decision that allowed\npatents on genetic material used in  Myriad Genetics Inc. (MYGN)  tests\nfor breast and ovarian cancer.  The  high court  on March 20 said that patents shouldn\u2019t be\nallowed on tests that look at, for instance, the proper dosage\nfor a medicine based on a body\u2019s reaction to a drug. Such tests\nmerely cover natural phenomenon and aren\u2019t inventions, the court\nruled. The Federal Circuit, which specializes in U.S. patent\nlaw, must consider the effect of that ruling on the Myriad\npatents.  \u201cThe message is, \u2018We\u2019re not prejudging what the outcome\nshould be in this case, but we don\u2019t think you\u2019ve analyzed it in\nthe right way,\u2019\u201d said Nick Groombridge, a patent lawyer with\n Paul Weiss  in  New York  who also teaches law at Columbia and\nRutgers Universities.  The March 20 decision involved a dispute between Nestle\nSA\u2019s Prometheus unit and units of the  Mayo Clinic  and whether\ncertain types of diagnostic tests met the threshold of\neligibility for a patent. A June 2010 decision by the Supreme\nCourt also addressed what types of inventions qualify for legal\nprotection.  Array of Opponents  Myriad said the case doesn\u2019t involve all of its patents\nthat cover the screening tests. Still, the company said, it\nwould defend the claims that are the subject of the lawsuit.  \u201cIt has great importance to the medical, pharmaceutical,\nbiotechnology and other commercial industries, as well as the\nhundreds of millions of people whose lives are bettered by the\nproducts these industries develop based on the promise of strong\npatent protection,\u201d Myriad Chief Executive Officer Peter Meldrum said in a statement.  The Myriad case pits the biotechnology industry, which\nsupports gene patents, against an array of opponents --including\ndoctors, researchers and patients -- who say gene patents will\nstifle innovation and improperly permit a monopoly on part of\nthe human body. The case affects the field of personalized\nmedicine, in which doctors determine whether a patient is\nsusceptible to a particular disease or would be more responsive\nto certain medications.  Human Genes  \u201cThe question of whether human genes and the information\nthey convey are patentable is of paramount importance to the\nfuture of  patent law , the advancement of medical science and\npatients\u2019 health,\u201d the challengers to the Myriad patents argued\nin their appeal.  The group, whose legal team includes the  American Civil\nLiberties Union , is pressing a test case against Salt Lake City-\nbased Myriad. The company makes tests for the hereditary risk of\nbreast and ovarian cancer.  The Prometheus patents \u201cexcluded too many other people\nfrom developing new things,\u201d said James Mullen, a patent lawyer\nwith Morrison & Foerster in  San Diego  who specializes in helping\nbiotechnology companies obtain patents. He said that the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s decision to have the Federal Circuit look at the patents\nanew is good news for patents on gene-related technology.  \u201cIf they wanted to put a stake through the heart of these\nclaims, they\u2019d do it,\u201d Mullen said of the  Supreme Court . \u201cIf\nthey delve into isolated DNA claims, they would have the ability\nto disrupt and cripple biotechnology across the board.\u201d  Myriad Rises  Myriad rose 56 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $23.34 at 4 p.m.,\nits biggest one-day jump since Feb. 23. About 2.5 million shares\nwere traded, almost four times the three-month daily average.  About 20 percent of human genes have some level of patent\nprotection, according to a 2005 article in Science magazine. The\nbiotechnology industry says patents let it attract  venture\ncapital  to pay for research into new medicines and the causes of\ndiseases.  The central legal issue is whether so-called isolated DNA -\n- genetic coding that has been removed from the body and\nseparated from other material -- is a product of nature and thus\nineligible for patent protection under previous Supreme Court\nrulings.  In the March 20 decision, Justice  Stephen Breyer  wrote for\na unanimous court in warning against \u201ctying up the use of the\nunderlying natural laws.\u201d  Actual Politics  \u201cTo the extent that actual politics intrude on the thought\nprocess of the Supreme Court, I wonder if they\u2019re not concerned\nwith patent policy that results in an increase in costs to\npatients,\u201d Mullen said.  Genes are encoded strands of nucleotides in different\nsequences that are responsible for inherited traits. In\nisolating genes, Myriad strips out unneeded information to home\nin on aspects that determine whether a person has a higher risk\nof breast and ovarian cancer.  In court papers, Myriad said that \u201chuman intervention\u201d\nbrings isolated DNA within the scope of the U.S. patent laws.\nThe company says the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued\n2,645 patents for isolated DNA over the past 30 years.  The case is Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad\nGenetics, 11-725.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nGreg Stohr in  Washington  at \n gstohr@bloomberg.net .
