 "context": "The following article called 'Orders for U.S. Durable Goods Probably Increased in April' was published on 2012-05-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOrders for  durable goods  probably\nclimbed in April, a sign manufacturing will keep contributing to\nthe U.S. expansion, economists said before a report today.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years\nincreased 0.2 percent after falling 3.9 percent the prior month,\naccording to the median forecast of economists surveyed by\nBloomberg News. Orders excluding transportation equipment, which\nis often volatile, may have advanced 0.8 percent.  A rebound in auto making as growing confidence in the\neconomy prompts Americans to replace older models may ripple\nthrough manufacturing, keeping assembly lines busy this quarter.\nAt the same time, slowdowns in  Europe  and parts of  Asia  may\nrestrain demand, leaving factories more dependent on U.S.\ncustomers to sustain gains.  \u201cManufacturing right now is at a point where it\u2019s keeping\nup with consumer and business demand,\u201d said  Russell Price , a\nsenior economist at Ameriprise Financial Inc. in  Detroit . \u201cMost\nof the demand is here domestically. New orders are just starting\nto moderate from Europe.\u201d  The Commerce Department\u2019s durable goods report is scheduled\nto be released at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Estimates of the 75\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg ranged from a decline of 2.8\npercent to a 4.2 percent gain.  A drop in airplane bookings probably restrained the\nincrease in total demand, economists said. Boeing Co., the\nlargest U.S. aircraft maker, said it received orders for four\nplanes last month, down from 53 in March.  Business Investment  Orders for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft, a\nproxy for  business investment  in items such as computers,\nengines and communications gear, advanced 0.8 percent after a\n3.6 percent drop the previous month, according to the median\nforecast.  Auto manufacturing has been bolstering factory growth.\nDuring the past four months, cars have sold at the fastest pace\nin four years, according to industry data.  Regional manufacturing gauges for this month have been\nmixed. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  showed\nfactories in the region expanded at a faster pace in May, while\na similar measure for the  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia \nshowed manufacturing shrank for the first time since September.  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT)  is among manufacturers seeing an\nimprovement in demand in some areas. The largest producer of\nchipmaking equipment said on May 17 that third-quarter sales may\nexceed some analysts\u2019 estimates as customers spend to increase\noutput of smartphone components.  \u2018Strong\u2019 Market  \u201cThe market for smartphones and tablets is very strong,\u201d\nChief Executive Officer Mike Splinter said in a phone interview.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing constraints in the chip-building parts of the\nsupply chain.\u201d  Shares of machinery makers have kept pace with the broader\nstock market this year. The Standard & Poor\u2019s Machinery\nSupercomposite Index, which includes companies like Caterpillar\nInc. and Cummins Inc., has climbed 6 percent, compared with a\n4.9 percent increase for the broader  S&P 500 Index .  A separate report today may show 370,000 Americans filed\nfor jobless benefits for a third straight week, a sign of\nstability in the labor market, according to the median estimate\nin a Bloomberg survey ahead of Labor Department figures due at\n8:30 a.m. in Washington.  \nTo contact the reporter on this story:\nTimothy R.
