 "context": "The following article called 'Christie Calls for More Inspections of Private Halfway Homes' was published on 2012-06-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie\nordered more inspections of privately run halfway houses after a\nreport that the facilities were rampant with sexual assaults,\ndrugs and a trail of violence, including homicide, by escapees.  The  New York Times (NYT)  cited a 10-month investigation in its\nreport on Community Education Centers Inc., a closely held\ncompany with political connections to Christie, a Republican who\nfaces re-election in 2013. Since 2005, 5,100 former prison\ninmates have escaped from the state\u2019s privately run halfway\nhouses, including at least 1,300 since Christie took office in\n2010, the Times said.  William J. Palatucci, a political adviser to Christie, is a\nsenior vice president at Community Education. The Times report\non the company was published as Christie, 49, negotiates a  tax\ncut  with lawmakers and tries to win approval of his $32.1\nbillion budget before a July 1 deadline.  \u201cWhile many of the disturbing accounts reported in today\u2019s\n New York  Times documenting lax oversight and accountability in\nsome of New Jersey\u2019s halfway houses took place prior to this\nadministration, we have an obligation to ensure the community\nplacements program is effectively and safely operating today,\u201d\nChristie, a former U.S. prosecutor, said in a statement.  Democratic Assemblyman  Joseph Cryan , an undersheriff from\nUnion County who serves on his chamber\u2019s Law and Public Safety\nCommittee, said the operations of the West Caldwell-based\ncompany should be suspended until an investigation determines\nthe validity of claims by the Times. He and Assemblyman Charles Mainor, a Democrat from  Jersey City  who heads the law committee,\ncalled for hearings.  \u2018Protecting the Public\u2019  The Times reported that in 2010, David Goodell fled the\nLogan Hall halfway house in  Newark  and killed his girlfriend,\nwho was from Garfield.  Brigid Harrison , a law and political\nscience professor at  Montclair State University , said the\nreports may be \u201cenormously damaging\u201d for Christie.  \u201cAny political opponent will seize on the very compelling\nstories of the victims,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.  Democratic Senator Barbara Buono criticized corrections\nofficials\u2019 oversight of the centers, which handle as many as \n3,714 offenders at six locations, according to the company\u2019s \nwebsite.  \u201cThey should be protecting the public, not turning a\nprofit for a politically connected company,\u201d she said in an e-\nmail.  Privately Run  Reached by telephone today, Palatucci said the Times story\nwas an attempt to state a preference for a public policy and\nbring about a change in the privatization of halfway houses. He\nsaid the report overlooked independent data that didn\u2019t bear out\nassumptions made in the story.  \u201c New Jersey \u2019s got the best system in the country,\u201d said\nPalatucci, who was co-chairman of Christie\u2019s inaugural\ncommittee. \u201cIt can always be fine-tuned and improved, but let\u2019s\nfocus first on acknowledging that the community corrections\nsystem in New Jersey has worked well.\u201d  \u2018Hit-Job Journalism\u2019  Palatucci said the state currently has 2,742 beds in so-\ncalled community-corrections centers compared with 2,700 10\nyears ago. Under former Democratic Governor  Jon Corzine , New\nJersey increased funding to the facilities to $61.5 million from\n$51.3 million, he said.  Michael Drewniak , a spokesman for Christie, said the story\nwas \u201chit-job journalism at its absolute worst.\u201d  \u201cThe Times paints a wantonly false and inflammatory story\nthat ignores the true successes of community corrections in our\nstate and a long bipartisan-supported approach that balances re-\nentry services for those most amenable to rehabilitation\nprograms with traditional prison,\u201d Drewniak said in an e-mail\nearlier today.  Steven Goldberg, a spokesman for Corzine, declined to\ncomment on the story when reached by telephone.  \u201cThe political threat to someone like  Chris Christie  is if\na major, heinous crime occurs by one of these escapees,\u201d Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey\nPolitics at  Rider University  in Lawrenceville, said in a\ntelephone interview.  In 1988, a crime spree by convicted murderer Willie R.\nHorton, released from a Massachusetts prison on a weekend pass,\nled to the political downfall of then-Governor  Michael Dukakis ,\nwho had supported such furloughs.  \u201cNo politician wants a Willie Horton story on their\nrecord, and that\u2019s the story here,\u201d Dworkin said.
