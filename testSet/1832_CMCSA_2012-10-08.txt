 "context": "The following article called 'Zombies Join Kevin Spacey in Cannes Seeking Web Money' was published on 2012-10-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nZombies and secret agents will join actor  Kevin Spacey  on the French Riviera this week for a TV trade show that will pit content-hungry Websites such as  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  and Hulu LLC against traditional broadcasters.  The success of companies streaming videos over the Internet are a blessing for production companies behind shows such as \u201c American Idol \u201d and \u201cMasterchef\u201d that are offering dramas, reality series and comedies at the Cannes Mipcom fair, the world\u2019s biggest market for TV programs. Those sites as well as  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) \u2019s Lovefilm are willing to pay top dollar for rights to lure viewers from TV to the Web.  \u201cNetflix and Hulu are competing aggressively and they are going to the source for rights -- the producers,\u201d said  Jack Davison , a consultant at London-based TV adviser 3Vision, who has worked for broadcasters such as  BBC  Worldwide and  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) \u2019s  MTV Networks . \u201cIt\u2019s new money for the production companies, and a new person to pitch to.\u201d  The streaming sites, which allow consumers to watch movies and films anytime, are challenging established broadcasters and are increasingly commissioning exclusive content. With spending on digital platforms set to more than double to $6.7 billion in 2015 according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, they are changing the TV landscape -- evident at Mipcom, where Hulu Chief Executive Officer  Jason Kilar  will give a keynote.  Netflix, which has more than 27 million subscribers in the U.S., Britain, Ireland,  Canada  and  Latin America , aims to expand in  Scandinavia  this year. Hulu operates in the U.S. and Japan.  Audience Shift  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a shift of audience from TV to online,\u201d said Claire Tavernier, head of new media division FMX at  FremantleMedia , the production arm of Europe\u2019s biggest broadcaster  RTL Group SA (RTL) . The company has been \u201cknocking on the doors\u201d of companies such as Hulu, Netflix and  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s YouTube site and has sold about 115 hours of content to Netflix.  Producers coming to Cannes this year include the makers of zombie series \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d and \u201cThe Voice\u201d producer  Mark Burnett , who will promote his latest series, \u201cThe Bible,\u201d a 10-hour drama from Genesis to Revelation. Producer  Harvey Weinstein , who is behind films including \u201cInglourious Basterds,\u201d will pitch his latest TV endeavors such as \u201cThe No. 1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency.\u201d  \u2018Serious Money\u2019  FremantleMedia, with shows such as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d and \u201cThe Farmer Wants a Wife,\u201d has a deal with Hulu to distribute its shows internationally, including \u201cA Day in the Life,\u201d a documentary series by filmmaker Morgan Spurlock chronicling a day in the life of someone notable such as businessman  Richard Branson  or chef  Mario Batali .  \u201cNetflix, Hulu and others have disrupted the whole chain by coming to the market and competing and paying serious money for TV rights,\u201d said Stewart Clarke, an editorial director at researcher Informa Telecoms & Media.  Google\u2019s YouTube site yesterday  said  it\u2019s adding new video channels from  France , Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. to the 100 it has introduced in the last year to show exclusive content backed by \u201csome of the biggest producers, well-known celebrities and emerging media companies.\u201d Google, which said its top 25 original channels are averaging over a million views every week, said the new content will feature topics such as cooking, wellness, parenting and sports.  New Buyers  Hulu, based in  Los Angeles , is attending Mipcom as a buyer and seller, said Andy Forssel, senior vice president of content.  \u201cWe represent a new set of buyers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe upside for all these production companies is a new buyer and new money to make, or getting a green light for something they couldn\u2019t make in the past.\u201d  Hulu and Netflix also have started commissioning original content. Netflix won the rights for \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d a political drama with actor Kevin Spacey based on a series of the same name by the BBC, over competitors including pay-TV operator  HBO . Spacey is in Cannes to promote the show. Netflix ran its first original series \u201c Lilyhammer \u201d this year, starring Steven Van Zandt in a series about a  New York  gangster trying to start a new life in  Norway .  \u2018The Hour\u2019  Shine Group, the production company founded by  Elisabeth Murdoch  and acquired by her father  Rupert Murdoch \u2019s  News Corp. (NWSA)  last year, has a deal with Netflix to show episodes of \u201c The Hour ,\u201d a thriller about TV journalism in the 1950s, after it aired on the BBC, said  Gordon Synn , a digital media consultant at the company.  Endemol NV (EML) , the company behind \u201cBig Brother\u201d and \u201cDeal or No Deal,\u201d is working with Hulu to screen Australian dramas that haven\u2019t been seen in the U.S., said head of distribution  Cathy Payne .  Competition from Websites has prompted broadcasters to strike back and start similar services.  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , the U.K.\u2019s biggest pay-TV company, introduced a video-on-demand service this year, and the country\u2019s broadcasters unveiled YouView, a set-top box enabling viewers to watch movies and TV shows on demand.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the biggest U.S. cable operator, started streaming service  Xfinity Streampix .  Rising Competition  Concerns that competition will hamper subscriber growth have weighed on Netflix shares. The stock dropped 25 percent on July 25 on concern the company may not meet its full-year target of adding 7 million U.S. users.  BSkyB Chief Operating Officer Mike Darcey predicts many new Web services will struggle to compete for the best content in the longer term. \u201cI have my doubts as to whether\u201d digital platforms \u201ccan sustain at a high level in terms of volume and quality,\u201d he said.  BSkyB, with more than 10 million subscribers, spends more than 2 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) a year on producing its own content. Netflix\u2019s costs to acquire content in 2012 will rise to more than $2 billion, Wedbush Securities estimates. Hulu has said it will spend $500 million on shows and films this year.  Quinn Taylor , senior vice president for movies, miniseries and acquisitions at ABC Entertainment Group, which produces programs for  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) \u2019s ABC network, said that while video-streaming sites might increase competition, they\u2019re still far from replacing the established broadcasters.  \u201cOf course they are driving prices up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the amount of content they need and can afford right now doesn\u2019t touch what we need.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Kristen Schweizer in Cannes, France via  kschweizer1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at  kwong11@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Comcast Corporation - Class A was 15.46965217590332 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Comcast Corporation - Class A was ",
