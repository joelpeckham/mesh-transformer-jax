 "context": "The following article called 'Election Rules, Barclays, Insider Trading: Compliance' was published on 2012-07-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  Federal Election Commission  on\nFriday said that it would require groups funding issue ads, such\nas the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Crossroads GPS, to disclose\ntheir donors.  The FEC ruling applies only to what are known as\n\u201celectioneering communications,\u201d so-called issue ads that run\nbefore an election and mention a federal candidate without\nurging viewers to vote for or against the person. \u201cIndependent\nexpenditures,\u201d which advocate support or opposition to a\ncandidate, aren\u2019t affected by the FEC decision.  The commission said all groups should report donors of\n$1,000 or more effective March 30. That\u2019s when a U.S. District\nCourt judge threw out FEC rules allowing groups to hide their\ncontributors. The case was brought by Representative  Chris Van\nHollen , a Maryland Democrat, who argued that the 2002 campaign-\nfinance law required such disclosure.  That district court ruling has been appealed, and the FEC\nsaid it could reverse its policy if a higher court overturns the\ndecision. A phone calls to the Chamber wasn\u2019t immediately\nreturned.  \u201cThe FEC statement is not new policy, but rather\nreiterates the Van Hollen decision,\u201d said Jonathan Collegio, a\nCrossroads spokesman.

(MCK) , the largest U.S drug distributor, reached a\n$151 million settlement with states over claims it caused\nMedicaid programs to pay too much for prescription drugs.  The agreement resolves allegations that McKesson overbilled\nstates by reporting inflated prices for medications, state\nattorneys general said Friday.

Barclays Says FSA Investigating Finance Director Over Fees  Barclays Plc (BARC)  said the Financial Services Authority is\ninvestigating four current and former senior employees including\nFinance Director Chris Lucas over the sufficiency of disclosure\nof fees payable.  \u201cThe FSA is investigating the sufficiency of disclosure in\nrelation to fees payable under certain commercial agreements and\nwhether these may have related to Barclays capital raisings in\nJune and November 2008,\u201d Barclays said in a statement on\nFriday. \u201cBarclays considers that it satisfied its disclosure\nobligations and confirms that it will cooperate fully with the\nFSA\u2019s investigation.\u201d  The bank made the disclosure Friday as it reported first-\nhalf  profit  that beat  analyst  estimates.  \u201cWe are sorry for what has happened,\u201d Chairman Marcus\nAgius said in a statement. \u201cHowever, our leadership continues\nto focus on the delivery of our financial performance targets.\u201d  The bank is also being investigated over whether it\nadequately disclosed fees it agreed to pay to the Qatar\nInvestment Authority as it sought to raise money from investors\nincluding the sovereign wealth fund, according to a person with\nknowledge of the situation.  \u201cThe bank entered into an agreement for the provision of\nadvisory services by Qatar Investment Authority to Barclays in\nthe Middle East,\u201d the lender said in a June 2008 statement\ndetailing the fundraising. The FSA is probing whether that\ndisclosure was adequate, said the person, who declined to be\nidentified because the terms of the investigation are private.  Stephen Benzikie, an external spokesman for Qatar Holding,\npart of the Qatar Investment Authority, and Liam Parker, an FSA\nspokesman, declined to comment.  Dutch Regulators Probe Libor, Euribor Submission Process  Dutch regulators are conducting a probe into potential\nrigging of interbank lending rates, as a global scandal\ntriggered by the manipulation of Libor widens.  \u201cThe Dutch central bank is conducting an investigation in\nthe broadest sense into possible manipulation of the Libor and\nEuribor submission process,\u201d said Kees Verhagen, a spokesman\nfor the Amsterdam-based central bank. The probe is being carried\nout jointly with financial markets regulator AFM and in\ncooperation with international supervisors, he said by telephone\nFriday.  The central bank declined to say which firms are under\ninvestigation. Dutch newspaper Het Financieele Dagblad reported\non Friday that Rabobank Groep, the only Dutch bank on the Libor\npanel, fired four traders in 2008 and 2011 for possible\ninvolvement in manipulation of the rate. The bankers, based in\nLondon, were suspected of rigging rates to help colleagues boost\nprofit, the paper said.  Rabobank spokesman Hendrik Jan Eijpe declined to comment on\nthe employees. The bank is cooperating with the investigations\nby regulators, he said.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan\u2019s biggest\npublicly traded bank, earlier this month said it suspended two\nLondon-based traders as investigators probe the suspected\nmanipulation of benchmark  interest rates . The two traders\nformerly worked at Rabobank, one of at least 12 banks being\nprobed by regulators over allegations they rigged the London and\neuro interbank offered rates, a person with knowledge of the\nsituation said on July 9.  The U.K. and the U.S. are criminally investigating how\nderivatives traders and rate submitters colluded to rig Libor,\nand other interest rates. Barclays was fined 290 million pounds\n($456 million) in June by U.S. and U.K. regulators for\nsubmitting false rates. The lender on Friday apologized for its\nrole in the scandal.  U.K. Insider-Trade Ring Members Sentenced to Up to 42 Months  Six men who were found guilty in the U.K.\u2019s largest\ninsider-trading-ring prosecution were sentenced to jail terms of\nas long as 42 months in prison.  The men, who traded on inside information taken from the\nprint rooms for  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , received\nsentences ranging from 18 months to three-and-a-half years\nFriday at a London criminal court. They were found guilty of\nmaking 732,044 pounds ($1.15 million) after a four-and-a-half\nmonths-long trial.  \u201cYou knew precisely what you were doing and the fraudulent\ntrading was carefully planned,\u201d Judge Jeffrey Pegden told the\ndefendants. \u201cYour offending is so serious as to only justify\nimmediate custodial sentences.\u201d  The arrests of the eight men came at the height of the\nfinancial crisis in 2008 as the U.K. Financial Services\nAuthority was under criticism from lawmakers and other\nregulators for failing to do enough to combat market abuse. The\nLondon-based FSA, which was created in 1997, had only filed\nthree criminal insider-trading cases before the raids in the\nprint-room investigation.  For more, click here.  BofA, Wells Fargo Used Firms That Led to CFPB Accord  Bank of America Corp. ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) \nwere among the largest clients of firms whose products led to a\n$210 million settlement between  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  and\nfederal regulators.  Intersections Inc. (INTX)  and Affinion Group Holdings Inc. both\nprovided credit-monitoring programs that were marketed and sold\nby third-party vendors to Capital One cardholders, according to\nsettlement  documents  dated July 17. Bank of America, Wells Fargo\nand Citigroup were listed in securities filings as major\ncustomers by one or both of the providers, with Bank of America\naccounting for more than half of annual revenue at\nIntersections. The vendors weren\u2019t named, and regulators didn\u2019t\naccuse Intersections or Affinion of misconduct.  Capital One settled accusations July 18 that vendors used\ndeceptive, high-pressure practices to sell optional products\nsuch as credit monitoring and payment protection. It was the\nfirst public enforcement case brought by the year-old Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau, and Director  Richard Cordray  said\nmore firms that marketed similar products will face sanctions.  \u201cWe know these deceptive marketing tactics for credit-card\nadd-on products are not unique to a single institution,\u201d\nCordray said last week. \u201cWe expect announcements about other\ninstitutions as our ongoing work continues to unfold.\u201d He\ndidn\u2019t name any of the firms, and Jen Howard, a CFPB\nspokeswoman, declined to comment on enforcement plans.  The dispute concerns so-called payment protection, which\npays credit-card bills in case of job loss or disability, and\nmonitoring services that alert customers to changes in their\ncredit profiles.  Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup spokesmen\ndeclined to comment on whether they received complaints or faced\nenforcement actions similar to those at McLean, Virginia-based\nCapital One, and the CFPB hasn\u2019t accused them of wrongdoing.  Intersections is a publicly traded firm based in Chantilly,\nVirginia, while Affinion, based in Stamford, Connecticut, is\nowned by private-equity firms  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and\n General Atlantic LLC .  James Hart, an Affinion spokesman, declined to comment on\nthe company\u2019s relationship with current clients. Affinion hasn\u2019t\nworked with Capital One since 2001, when Intersections took over\nmanagement of credit-protection products, Hart said. Leslie\nGarrett, a spokeswoman for Intersections, declined to comment on\nspecific clients.  For more, click here.  Halliburton Says Has Started Internal Investigation on Iraq Work  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , the world\u2019s second-largest oilfield\nservices provider, has begun internal investigations into its\noperations in Angola and Iraq.  The probes are looking at payments made to third-party\nagents related to customs matters in Angola and Iraq, as well as\nvisa issues in Iraq, Houston-based Halliburton said Friday in a\nfederal filing.  Halliburton alerted U.S. Justice Department and Securities\nand Exchange officials during the second quarter that it had\nbegun the inquiry after meeting with them about another internal\ninvestigation the company has under way about possible\nviolations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA.  Halliburton has previously said it received an anonymous e-\nmail in December 2010 alleging that current and former employees\nviolated Halliburton\u2019s own business-conduct codes and the FCPA,\nmainly through its dealings with an Angolan vendor. The e-mail\nhas alleged \u201cconflicts of interest, self-dealing and the\nfailure to act on alleged violations,\u201d Halliburton has said in\nfederal filings.  Two Duke Energy Directors Resign, Call for CEO Replacement  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  directors Theresa M. Stone and John D.\nBaker II, who joined the board when the company took over\nProgress Energy Inc., resigned and called on Duke to begin the\nprocess to replace its chief executive officer.  Stone and Baker, who previously served on the Progress\nboard, announced their resignations in separate  letters  filed\nFriday with the  North Carolina  Utilities Commission. The state\nagency is investigating Duke\u2019s decision to fire  Bill Johnson ,\nthe former Progress CEO, within hours of completing its $17.8\nbillion takeover on July 2.  Johnson, who was supposed to become CEO of the new company,\nwas replaced by Duke CEO  Jim Rogers . Two other former Progress\nboard members, E. Marie McKee and James B. Hyler, told the\ncommission on July 19 they were considering resigning over the\nexecutive change. The board of the combined company had voted\n10-5 to replace Johnson, with all former Progress members\nopposed.  \u201cThe board should immediately identify and adopt a process\nfor selecting a new CEO and institute that process as soon as\npossible,\u201d Baker wrote in a letter to Rogers and Ann Maynard\nGray, the company\u2019s lead director. \u201cOnly after taking these\nimmediate steps will the board be able to work together for the\nbest interests of Duke\u2019s shareholders.\u201d  SEC Freezes Trader Assets in Probe of Cnooc\u2019s Nexen Purchase  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission obtained a\ncourt order to freeze assets of traders who allegedly reaped\nmore than $13 million by trading illegally ahead of  Cnooc Ltd. (883) \u2019s\nannouncement that it would buy  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   Hong Kong-based Well Advantage Ltd., controlled by Zhang\nZhi Rong, and other unidentified traders stockpiled shares of\nNexen based on confidential information about the deal, the SEC\nsaid in a July 27 statement announcing a complaint filed in\nfederal court in Manhattan. The court order froze about $38\nmillion in assets, the SEC said.  Nexen\u2019s stock rose more than  50 percent  on July 23 after\nCnooc, China\u2019s largest offshore oil and gas explorer, said it\nwould pay $15.1 billion in cash to acquire the Calgary-based\ncompany. Well Advantage\u2019s owner Zhang, a billionaire, is the\ncontrolling shareholder of  China Rongsheng Heavy Industries\nGroup Holdings Ltd. (1101) , a Hong Kong-based company that engages in\nsignificant business activities with Cnooc, the SEC said.  \u201cThis may be the tip of an iceberg suggesting that the\ngovernment in China has to be more careful about their business\nand business partners,\u201d said Joseph Fan, co-director of the\nInstitute of Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of\nHong Kong.  Many individuals doing business with state-owned\nenterprises are well connected and there are complicated\nrelationships and transactions between them, Fan said.  Zhang wasn\u2019t available for comment, Glorious Property\u2019s\npublic relations manager Doris Chung said.  China Rongsheng Heavy Industries said in a statement that\nZhang doesn\u2019t have any executive role, and business operations\nwon\u2019t be affected. The shipbuilder won an order from state-owned\nCnooc to build a deepwater pipe-laying vessel in 2007 and Cnooc\nwas one of the cornerstone investors in its initial public\noffering in Hong Kong in November 2010.  Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission and Cnooc\ndeclined to comment on the case.  For more, click here.  Anglo Irish Debt Exchange Was \u2018Negative Inducement,\u2019 Judge Says  The measures the Irish government used to persuade\nbondholders to take losses as it restructured Anglo Irish Bank\nCorp. were unfair to the minority of investors who didn\u2019t want\nto take part, a U.K. court ruled.  Judge Michael Briggs on July 27  called  the mechanism a\n\u201cnegative inducement\u201d to force bondholders to accept the\noffer. The case was brought by Anglo Irish bondholder Assenagon\nAsset Management SA.  The ruling focuses on the legality of so-called exit\nconsent measures under which the nationalized lender offered\nholders of the bonds a choice between receiving a smaller amount\nin exchange for their notes or being effectively wiped out.\nOther countries, including Greece, used similar methods to\nrestructure their debt.  The exchange offer was \u201cfair, transparent\u201d and all note\nholders were provided with comprehensive notice in advance,\nIrish Bank Resolution Corp., the successor to Anglo Irish, said\nin a statement. \u201cIBRC is firmly of the view that these\nsecurities would have been valueless without the\nrecapitalization of the bank by the Irish State.\u201d  The IBRC said it was given permission to appeal and is\n\u201cconsidering its options.\u201d  The case is Assenagon Asset Management SA v. Anglo Irish\nBank Corp.,  High Court  of Justice Chancery Division, HC11C01320.  In the Courts  ABP Suit Against Ace Securities Can Proceed, Judge Says  A lawsuit brought by Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, Europe\u2019s\nsecond-biggest pension fund, against a  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) \naffiliate over residential mortgage-backed securities can\nproceed, a New York judge ruled.  Ace Securities Corp. must face two claims in the suit, for\ncommon-law fraud and fraudulent inducement, New York State\n Supreme Court  Justice Jeffrey Oing in Manhattan said Friday. The\njudge dismissed claims of aiding and abetting fraud and\nnegligent misrepresentation. The plaintiffs could refile the\naiding-and-abetting claim, he said.  ABP, based in Heerlen, Netherlands, sued Ace Securities,\nDeutsche Bank and four other bank affiliates in state court in\nManhattan in September, saying it bought residential mortgage-\nbacked securities while relying on allegedly false and\nmisleading statements.  ABP has sued other banks in the same court over similar\nallegations, including Credit Suisse Group AG, JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   Ace Securities, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was\nformed by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. to facilitate the sale\nof residential  mortgage loans  through securitizations, ABP said\nin the complaint.  Oing dismissed Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank Home Lending\nLLC and DB Structured Products Inc. from the case, leaving Ace\nSecurities, Deutsche Bank Securities and another Deutsche Bank\naffiliate as defendants.  \u201cWe are encouraged that the judge dismissed several claims\nand defendants and is still considering whether to dismiss the\nentire case on statute of limitations grounds,\u201d  Duncan King , a\nNew York-based spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said in a statement.  The ruling \u201cshows that investors will be able to get to\ndiscovery on these claims,\u201d Geoffrey C. Jarvis, an attorney\nwith Grant & Eisenhofer who is representing ABP, said after\nFriday\u2019s hearing. The fraud allegation is the \u201ckey claim\u201d in\nthe suit, he said.  The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. Ace Securities\nCorp., 652460/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  Iceland\u2019s Kaupthing Sues to Rescind $1.5 Billion of Transactions  The caretakers of failed Icelandic lender  Kaupthing Bank hf \nhave filed about 50 lawsuits in order to rescind transactions\nthat were executed in the last months prior to the bank\u2019s\ncollapse.  \u201cThe aggregate nominal amount claimed by Kaupthing in\nthese cases is equivalent to approximately 180 billion\nIcelandic\u201d kronur ($1.5 billion), the bank said in an e-mailed\nstatement from Reykjavik.  Kaupthing and two other Icelandic lenders defaulted on $85\nbillion in 2008, triggering an economic collapse in the north\nAtlantic island and an International Monetary Fund-led bailout.  The bank is now aiming to complete the winding-up\nproceedings by seeking an agreement with creditors which would\ngive them a stake in the future value of the bank\u2019s assets.\nKaupthing has 5.2 billion euros ($6.4 billion) in assets and 17\nbillion euros in claims.
