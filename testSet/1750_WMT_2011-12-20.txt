 "context": "The following article called 'At Wal-Mart a Microcosm of U.S. Inequalities: Jeffrey Goldberg' was published on 2011-12-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLast week, in a column about\nthe new billion-dollar Crystal Bridges Museum of American\nArt in Bentonville, Arkansas, I mentioned an economist\u2019s\n estimate  that the heirs of  Sam Walton , the founder of Wal-\nMart Stores Inc., are collectively worth about the same as\nthe bottom 30 percent of all Americans. Alice Walton, who\nfounded the museum, is herself worth about $21 billion.  This imbalance wouldn\u2019t seem so stark if Wal-Mart,\nwhose stock makes up much of the Walton family\u2019s wealth,\nhadn\u2019t made itself into the world\u2019s largest retailer in\npart by paying its workers so poorly, and by providing them\nwith only the stingiest health-care benefits -- or none at\nall.  After  the column  appeared, I received many e-mails\nfrom Wal-Mart workers. Most noted the dissonance between\ntheir lifestyles and that of Alice Walton and her siblings.  There were also some criticisms of the column. Felix Salmon, a blogger, took issue with the statistic showing\nthat the six Walton heirs are worth more than the bottom\n100 million or so Americans.  He  wrote : \u201cThis sounds outrageous, until you stop for\na second and take note of the fact that  Jeffrey Goldberg ,\nindividually, has a net worth greater than the bottom 25%\nof all Americans. According to the latest data we have,\n24.8% of American households had zero or negative net worth\n-- add them all together, and get zero. Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s\nnet worth, it\u2019s safe to say, is greater than zero.\u201d  Categories of Wealth  Although it\u2019s true that I have a net worth, and that I\nmight very well be in the 2 percent (based on an exhaustive\nanalysis of my checking account and my anemic 401(k), I\ndon\u2019t believe I would qualify for membership in the 1\npercent), I\u2019m not sure that Salmon\u2019s implicit argument --\nthat Alice Walton, like Jeffrey Goldberg, is rich, so\nwhat\u2019s the big deal? -- would carry weight with those who\nrecognize the existence of different categories of wealth.  And it seems as though Salmon is inadvertently\nbuttressing the argument, made by the Occupy Wall Street\nmovement among others, that something is awry in the U.S.\nwhen a quarter of all Americans have no net worth at all\nand Alice Walton has $21 billion in inherited wealth.  Salmon makes other, more interesting points. He\nquestions whether Walton could influence  Wal-Mart (WMT) \u2019s\nmanagement to raise wages. \u201cMaybe she could; I\u2019m not\nconvinced,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: In what way\ndoes building a beautiful museum prevent her from doing\njust that? The only way, it seems to me, is if we\u2019re in\nsome kind of zero-sum game, here, where the alternative to\nbuilding the museum would be for Walton to take the money\nshe would otherwise have spent on Crystal Bridges, and give\nit directly to Walmart workers.\u201d  I don\u2019t know what prevents Walton from arguing on\nbehalf of Wal-Mart\u2019s underpaid women (underpaid,  according\nto one study , even in relation to their male colleagues). I\nhave no doubt that Sam Walton\u2019s daughter could get herself\na respectful hearing with current management. But I\u2019ve\nnever heard even the faintest suggestion that she has taken\nan interest in the lives of the people who work at her\nfather\u2019s stores. If she sponsored an art museum as well as\na network of day-care centers for Wal-Mart employees, or a\nfleet of mobile dental clinics, well, I don\u2019t think my\ncomplaints would have quite as much salience.  Giving Something Back  To my surprise, not even her art museum seems to take\nan interest in the lives of Wal-Mart employees. I asked the\nmuseum\u2019s executive director, Don Bacigalupi, if he planned\nto provide local Wal-Mart workers with opportunities to\nlearn more about art.  \u201cWe\u2019re certainly delighted to welcome professional\nvisitors from all over the workforce here in northwest\n Arkansas  and elsewhere,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how to\nanswer the question.\u201d  I explained further, asking if he would institute\ncultural programs that might give something back to the\nworkers who make Wal-Mart so profitable.  \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cOur populations are people who work in\nall kinds of industries. They are all welcome to come.\u201d  Indifference to Wal-Mart, even a kind of disdain,\npermeates the  museum . At the gift shop, which sells Alessi\nsugar bowls for $90, wine and cheese totes for $61.95 and\nhandmade belts for $850, I noted to a saleswoman that most\nof the shop\u2019s offerings seemed beyond the reach of Wal-Mart\nemployees.  \u201cWell, this isn\u2019t a Wal-Mart,\u201d she said. Maybe, I\nsuggested, the museum should open a mini-Wal-Mart on site\nwith more affordable  Chinese-made  decorative items.  \u201cThat would be terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a\nplace for commercialism.\u201d  After I left the museum, I visited a couple of nearby\nWal-Marts to see what the rank-and-file thought of Alice\nWalton\u2019s vanity project. At the Springdale, Arkansas, Wal-\nMart, I couldn\u2019t find a single employee who had visited the\nmuseum, or was contemplating visiting it. One worker I met\nin the parking lot said that the museum wasn\u2019t meant for\nWal-Mart workers. Others were resentful. One middle-aged\nwoman noted how odd it was that the Wal-Mart heirs could\nspend so much on paintings but Wal-Mart workers couldn\u2019t\nget health-care benefits. \u201c Merry Christmas ,\u201d she said.  Many Wal-Mart employees I spoke to had only the\nfoggiest understanding of the  relationship  between their\nlabors and Alice Walton\u2019s wealth. A 21-year-old part-time\nemployee I spoke to had no idea who Alice Walton was. I\nexplained that she was Sam Walton\u2019s daughter, and that she\nand her siblings owned roughly half the company. \u201cHalf of\nWal-Mart?\u201d he asked, a look of shock on his face. \u201cMan,\nthey must be millionaires.\u201d  (Jeffrey Goldberg is a Bloomberg View columnist and a\nnational correspondent for the Atlantic.
