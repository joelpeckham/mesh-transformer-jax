 "context": "The following article called 'Bank Investors Dismiss Moody\u2019s Cuts as Years Too Late' was published on 2012-06-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMoody\u2019s Investors Service suffered a\ndowngrade of its own as markets responded to the company\u2019s\nrating cuts of 15 of the world\u2019s largest banks by bidding up the\nvalue of their stocks and bonds.  Shares of 12 of the firms affected by yesterday\u2019s action\nrose as of 11:38 a.m. in New York, and the cost to protect\n Morgan Stanley (MS)  debt against losses dropped to the lowest in more\nthan seven weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, after\nthe bank was cut two levels rather than a threatened three\ngrades. Credit-default swaps tied to  Bank of America Corp. ,\nwhich was lowered to within two levels of junk along with\n Citigroup Inc. (C) , also improved. The Bloomberg Europe Banks and\nFinancial Services Index added as much as 1.5 percent.  \u201cThe ratings agencies themselves are looking for a raison\nd\u2019etre\u201d as regulations in the U.S. and Europe try to reduce\ninvestors\u2019 dependence on the credit assessments, David Zervos,\nchief market strategist at Jefferies & Co., said in an interview\non Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cMarket Makers.\u201d \u201cThey like to be\nnoisy, and this is a way to be noisy. I don\u2019t think the effects\nare big in the end.\u201d  The prospect of downgrades had weighed on banks since\nMoody\u2019s said Feb. 15 it was reviewing 17 financial firms with\ncapital-markets operations because of fragile confidence and\ntighter regulations that pinched revenue. Pressure mounted as\nEurope\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis intensified and cast doubt on the\nhealth of some of the continent\u2019s lenders.  Market \u2018Shrugging\u2019  By the time the results came out four months later,\ninvestors such as Thornburg Investment Management Inc.\u2019s George Strickland had concluded the worst-case scenario for downgrades\nwas already reflected in securities prices.  \u201cIf anything, the market is reacting with relief,\u201d said\nStrickland, who helps oversee $14 billion of fixed-income assets\nas a managing director at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg.\nMorgan Stanley bonds likely will rally, said Strickland, whose\nfirm owns the firm\u2019s debt. \u201cThe market is shrugging it off.\u201d  The review concluded with none of the financial firms cut\nmore than Moody\u2019s had forecast, removing a drag on bank stocks\nbrought on by the uncertainty,  David Konrad , a KBW Inc. analyst\nin New York, wrote today.  \u201cWe view the Moody\u2019s downgrade as another overhyped story\nof 2012,\u201d  David Trone , analyst at JMP Securities LLC, wrote to\nhis clients. \u201cThe corporate market thinks for itself and credit\nrating agencies are often lagging indicators.\u201d  Stocks React  Financial stocks in the  Standard & Poor\u2019s  500 Index climbed\n0.8 percent at 11:21 a.m. New York time, the biggest gain among\n10 industries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  JPMorgan\nChase & Co. (JPM)  advanced as much as 2.8 percent and ranked among the\ntwo biggest gainers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Credit-default swaps on New York-based Morgan Stanley\ndeclined 28 basis points to 353.3 basis points as of 10:21 a.m.\nin New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s the\nlowest on an intraday basis since May 4. Swaps are used to\nprotect investors against losses on company debt, and the price\nincreases along with doubt about a firm\u2019s creditworthiness, so\ntoday\u2019s decline reflects an improving outlook.  Morgan Stanley\u2019s long-term senior unsecured debt rating was\nreduced two grades to Baa1, and nine other firms received two-\nlevel reductions, Moody\u2019s said yesterday in a statement.  Credit\nSuisse Group AG (CSGN) \u2019s  rating  was lowered three levels to A2 and\nZurich-based  UBS AG (UBSN) , the other firm singled out for a potential\nthree-level cut, dropped just two instead.  European Banks  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe\u2019s largest bank, was lowered one\ngrade instead of two, while  Barclays Plc (BARC)  was reduced two steps.\nEdinburgh-based  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  was lowered one\nstep, as was London-based  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain\u2019s\nbiggest mortgage lender.  \u201cAll of the banks affected by today\u2019s actions have\nsignificant exposure to the volatility and risk of outsized\nlosses inherent to capital-markets activities,\u201d Greg Bauer,\nMoody\u2019s global banking managing director, said in the statement.  The 43-company Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial\nServices Index erased earlier losses and rose 0.1 percent to\n73.01. Credit-default swaps on Barclays, BNP Paribas and  Societe\nGenerale  all fell, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs slid 16.9 basis\npoints to 277.4 basis points, the lowest since May 8, and\nCitigroup decreased 13.4 basis points to 245.6, Bloomberg prices\nshow. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Stronger Now  \u201cAmerican banks are stronger today than they were three\nyears ago,\u201d said  Gerard Cassidy , an analyst with RBC Capital\nMarkets, adding that market prices have long reflected concerns\nraised by Moody\u2019s. \u201cYes, their ratings are lower, but is Citi\ntomorrow going to have to pay an extra 50 basis points for\ncommercial paper? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d  In March, a month after announcing its review, Moody\u2019s cut\nSydney-based  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  and Tokyo-based  Nomura\nHoldings Inc. (8604)  one level each. Nomura is rated lowest of the 17\nfirms at Baa3, one grade above junk.  The downgrades reflect risks that the market has recognized\nfor years, investors said. The S&P 500 Financials Index dropped\n61 percent over the last five years, while the Bloomberg\nEuropean banks  index (BEBANKS)  is down 75 percent. Morgan Stanley\u2019s swap\nprices are more than double what they were a year ago, while\nCitigroup\u2019s have jumped about 70 percent.  Advance Warning  \u201cMoody\u2019s is not going to detect some problem in advance\nand move a rating to warn the public,\u201d said  Ken Fisher , chief\nexecutive officer and founder of Woodside, California-based\nFisher Investments, which has about $44 billion under\nmanagement. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a stock or a bond, the free market\nalready did that. Moody\u2019s goes along afterwards and effectively\nvalidates what the market\u2019s already done.\u201d  Large U.S. banks had ratings in the Baa range -- similar to\nBBB at Standard & Poor\u2019s -- in the 1980s and early 1990s, said\n David Hendler , an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in New York. That\nera followed Latin America\u2019s sovereign-debt defaults of the\n1980s, which forced lenders to set aside funds to cover bad\nloans to countries there.  \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they\u2019ve come full circle back to triple-\nB,\u201d Hendler said. \u201cThe industry has been through a triple-B\nphase before, and they will come back from it.\u201d  Collateral Impact  While bank stocks and bonds initially climbed yesterday,\nthe downgrades may have longer-term effects on operations,\nforcing some firms to post more collateral to trading partners\nin derivatives deals.  Citigroup and Bank of America, as the lowest-graded\ncompanies after Nomura, may be at a disadvantage in businesses\nsuch as trading derivatives that aren\u2019t centrally cleared. That\nmarket provides about 15 percent of the industry\u2019s trading\nrevenue, Kinner Lakhani, a Citigroup analyst, wrote in an April\n30 note. Both firms lost market share among the top nine banks\nin fixed-income trading last year, according to Bloomberg\nIndustries.  \u201cFor the banks that are in the BBB category, I\u2019m sure that\nwill have a negative impact on their ratings-sensitive\nbusinesses, like derivatives,\u201d Anil Lalchand, a credit analyst\nat DoubleLine Capital LP in Los Angeles, which manages $35\nbillion, said in a telephone interview.  While higher-rated banks such as JPMorgan and HSBC received\ncredit for retail businesses that serve as \u201cshock absorbers\u201d\nfrom the volatility of capital-markets-related units, Bank of\nAmerica and Citigroup\u2019s consumer divisions were \u201cthinner or\nless reliable\u201d cushions, Moody\u2019s said.  Future Downgrades  All the U.S. firms remained on negative outlook, which\nmeans their grades could be cut again, because government\nsupport may wane, Bob Young, managing director of North American\nbanking for Moody\u2019s, said in an interview.  Morgan Stanley, owner of the world\u2019s biggest brokerage,\navoided the largest potential downgrade because of possible\nsupport from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., according to\nMoody\u2019s. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman also cited his firm\u2019s\ncapital ratios in meetings with Moody\u2019s to convince the ratings\ncompany that a three-level cut wasn\u2019t deserved.  The rating cuts underscore how much less creditworthy\nMoody\u2019s views global banks compared with smaller rivals.\nMinneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by\ndeposits, is still rated Aa3, five levels higher than fourth-\nranked Citigroup or Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of\nAmerica, which is second behind JPMorgan, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Banks Respond  Citigroup said in a statement that the downgrade was\n\u201carbitrary and completely unwarranted,\u201d and called Moody\u2019s\napproach \u201cbackward-looking.\u201d Morgan Stanley said its ratings\ndon\u2019t reflect the actions it has taken to cut risk. Credit\nSuisse said it was pleased to remain among the top-rated large\nbanks, while Bank of America said it has strengthened its\ncapital and risk management.  The reductions by Moody\u2019s are \u201ca mea culpa from 2007 and\n2008,\u201d said James Leonard, a credit analyst in Chicago at\n Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  \u201cThe banks have gotten so much better in the\nlast few years in terms of capital, yet their ratings keep going\ndown. What does that tell you? That the ratings were so wrong\nbefore.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nDakin Campbell in  San Francisco  at \n dcampbell27@bloomberg.net ;\nMichael J.
