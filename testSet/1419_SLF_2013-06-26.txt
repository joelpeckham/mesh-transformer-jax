GSW, Berlin\u2019s largest residential landlord by market value,\nrose as much as 5.3 percent to 30 euros in  Frankfurt trading ,\nthe biggest gain since November 2011, boosting its market value\nto 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion). CEO Bernd Kottmann and\nChairman Eckart John von Freyend, who oversaw his appointment,\nwill both leave the company in July, the Berlin-based company\nsaid in a statement after the market closed yesterday.  Their departure ends two months of conflict that culminated\nat a Berlin meeting last week at which shareholders passed a no-confidence motion against Kottmann and voted to dismiss Freyend.\nThe ouster represents a rare show of force by shareholders in\n Europe \u2019s largest economy, where corporate-governance rules lag\nbehind U.K. and U.S. standards, said Peter Papadakos, an analyst\nwith Green Street Advisors in  London .  GSW, which owns 60,000 apartments in Berlin, said on March\n11 that CEO Thomas Zinnoecker would resign and announced a week\nlater that Kottmann would succeed him. PGGM NV, which  owns about\n3 percent  of GSW, called for votes on the appointment, saying\nthe speed with which Kottmann was chosen raised questions about\nthe thoroughness of the search.
