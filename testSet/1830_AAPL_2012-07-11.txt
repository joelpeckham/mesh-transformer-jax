The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIt\u2019s the most-asked question by\nconsumers about any new tech gadget: \u201cShould I get this now or\nis something better coming along soon?\u201d  For buyers of Amazon\u2019s Kindle Fire, we now have the answer:\nYou should have waited.  Google (GOOG) \u2019s new Nexus 7 is aimed directly at the Kindle Fire,\nthe seven-inch color tablet that was the runaway hit of the last\nholiday season. The Nexus 7 obliterates every reason for buying\nthe current Kindle, and sets a high bar for whatever Amazon\ncomes up with to replace it.  The Nexus 7 is Google\u2019s first foray into selling a tablet\nunder its own brand. It\u2019s currently available for pre-order from\n Google Play , the company\u2019s online store, with customer\ndeliveries expected to begin next week. It costs $199 for a\nmodel with eight gigabytes of storage, same as the Kindle, or\n$249 for 16 gigabytes.  The device is manufactured by Taiwan-based  Asustek (2357) , and\nGoogle chose its partner wisely. Asus makes some of the\nprettiest tablets and personal computers this side of Apple, and\nthe Nexus 7 is as attractive and smooth as the Kindle Fire is\nchunky and clunky.  At 7.8 inches tall and 4.7 inches wide, the Nexus 7 is\ncompact enough to slide into a jacket pocket. A rubbery,\ntextured back makes it easy to grip. Like the Kindle Fire, it\nworks only over a Wi-Fi connection; while the screens are the\nsame size, the Nexus 7\u2019s has a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels,\ncompared to the Kindle Fire\u2019s 1024 x 600.  More and Better  The Google tablet also has a more powerful, quad-core\nprocessor from  Nvidia (NVDA) , twice the internal memory and better\nbattery. At four-tenths of an inch thick and 12 ounces, it\u2019s\nalso thinner and 18 percent lighter.  Go down the list of standard tablet features, and the Nexus\n7 wins every one. Camera? None for the Kindle; the Nexus has a\nfront-facing camera and microphone for video calls.  Bluetooth? The Kindle doesn\u2019t have it; the Nexus 7 does.  GPS? Yes on the Nexus, along with a newly-enhanced Google\napp that lets you save maps for use even when you\u2019re offline.\nThe Kindle has nothing like it.  The Kindle has the Nexus beat in one significant area: the\ndepth and breadth of the online stores that are designed to keep\nthem stuffed with content. The Kindle is deeply integrated with\n Amazon (AMZN) \u2019s shops for e-books, music, movies and videos, which are\nall far richer than the sparsely stocked Google Play store.  Amazon Alternatives  On the other hand, Amazon makes an excellent free app that\nallows you to buy and read Kindle e-books on the Nexus 7. And\nthere\u2019s always  Netflix (NFLX)  for movies and Spotify for music, among\nmany others, as long as you\u2019re willing to manage the various\naccounts and log-ins yourself. (With the Kindle Fire, a single\nAmazon password is all you need.)  The Nexus 7 marks the debut of yet another iteration of the\nAndroid operating system: version 4.1, which Google calls\n\u201cJelly Bean.\u201d (Who knows why Google\u2019s sweets-themed naming\nsystem seems so much sillier than  Apple (AAPL) \u2019s  big cats  for its Mac\nreleases?)  Google\u2019s constant Android updates can be maddening for\nconsumers, who often find that even recently purchased devices\nwon\u2019t run the latest software.  Still, this new version is the most polished yet. It\u2019s fast\nand smooth, without any of the herky-jerkiness in reorienting\nthe device from landscape to portrait, or in transitions from\none screen to another, that afflicted earlier releases.  Google Now  There is also a passel of new features, notably Google Now.\nThis is a neat app that, with a single finger-swipe, supplies\nuseful information about where you are and what you\u2019re doing at\nany given moment.  Right now, for example, it\u2019s telling me how long it would\ntake to drive home given current traffic conditions, what the\nweather\u2019s like, nearby mass-transit departure times and the\nclosest restaurants. At an airport, it might show flight\ninformation; in a city, nearby places of interest.  Of course, Android wouldn\u2019t be Android without a head-\nscratcher or two. For instance, you can\u2019t view your home screen\nor display all your apps in landscape mode. Google says it will\naddress that one by the time Jelly Bean shows up on larger,\niPad-size tablets.  And that\u2019s the real endgame here. There\u2019s no doubt Apple is\nGoogle\u2019s No. 1 enemy in its struggle to establish Android on\ntablets, but no Android device has yet gained any traction going\nhead-to-head against the mighty iPad. So Google, which needs a\nhit device to convince developers to help it dent Apple\u2019s\nenormous lead in tablet-specific apps, went smaller and cheaper.  Apple, meanwhile, isn\u2019t standing still; if reports are to\nbe believed, it is working on its own smaller, cheaper iPad.  As for the Kindle Fire, in its current form you\u2019d have to\nconsider it collateral damage.  ( Rich Jaroslovsky  is a Bloomberg News columnist. The\nopinions expressed are his own.)
