 "context": "The following article called 'Facebook IPO Cuts Operators Out of Cash From Messaging' was published on 2012-04-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFacebook Inc. (FB) \u2019s increasing reach,\nbolstered by an initial public offering that may value the\ncompany at more than $100 billion, will hurt mobile-phone\noperators\u2019 sales from services such as text messaging,  Magister\nAdvisors  said.  \u201cFacebook\u2019s IPO is about the worst thing that could happen\nto network operators,\u201d Victor Basta, managing director of\nLondon-based Magister Advisors, which has advised companies such\nas Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s movie-streaming unit Lovefilm, said in a\nnote today. \u201cThey\u2019re supporting the end users\u2019 social\nnetworking habits, but they see very little, if any, commercial\nbenefit and the downside risks are significant.\u201d  European carriers including  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and Royal\nKPN NV have struggled to adapt to the surging demand for social\nmedia on mobile phones, with consumers increasingly\ncircumventing traditional text message charges by sending free\nmessages over the Internet. Operators may lose $23.2 billion in\nSMS revenue this year, after $13.9 billion in 2011, as\nsubscribers turn to outside social messaging apps, according to\nresearcher Ovum.  As Facebook feels more pressure to meet investors\u2019\nexpectations for profitability, wireless operators will have to\ndeal with more traffic on their networks and Facebook will have\na difficult time justifying sharing revenue with mobile\ncompanies, Basta said. Facebook applications such as the chat\nfeature may eat into operators\u2019 income for features such text\nmessaging, he said.  Data Plans  Still, many operators are embracing Facebook as they want\ncustomers to adopt more-expensive data plans to surf the Web.\n Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  has begun a partnership with the social\nnetworking site to drive traffic among Indian customers.  France\nTelecom SA (FTE) , the owner of the Orange mobile brand, announced\nplans last year to sell phones with unlimited access to Facebook\nin some markets in Europe and  Africa .  \u201cThe fundamental challenge for network operators will be\nfinding a way of becoming part of the Facebook ecosystem rather\nthan simply external enablers,\u201d Basta said.  A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on anything\nrelating to the IPO. Magister Advisors said it is not involved\nwith the transaction.  Facebook, based in  Menlo Park ,  California , filed in\nFebruary to raise $5 billion. The company\u2019s implied valuation\nrose to $102.8 billion on March 30 in what is expected to be the\nlast auction of internally circulated stock traded on the\nSharesPost Inc. exchange. The world\u2019s most popular social-\nnetworking site plans to hold its IPO in May, a person familiar\nwith the company\u2019s plans said last month.
