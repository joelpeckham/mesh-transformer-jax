 "context": "The following article called 'Austria \u2018Warehouse\u2019, Credit Suisse, NYC: Compliance' was published on 2012-06-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustria should consider warehousing\nrisky and non-performing assets of its nationalized lenders in a\nvehicle that isn\u2019t governed by banking laws, according to Klaus\nLiebscher, the manager in charge of the nation\u2019s bank aid.  Liebscher heads the Finanzmarktbeteiligung AG agency.  Putting toxic assets of rescued banks into a state-backed\nbody without a banking license may have advantages for Austrian\ntaxpayers, Liebscher said in an interview last week. Such a\nmodel would mimic Germany\u2019s FMS Wertmanagement, the agency that\nis winding down 176 billion euros ($221 billion) of assets from\nnationalized Hypo Real Estate Holding AG.  Austria nationalized two banks in 2008 and 2009 and\npartially took over another one this year to prevent their\ncollapse. The nation had to inject fresh capital into all three\nlenders to make sure they meet regulatory requirements after\nlosses on bad debt and on swaps depleted reserves. All major\nratings companies have warned the government that its banks are\nthe biggest risk to the Alpine republic\u2019s credit rating.  Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG, which Austria\nrescued after former owner Bayerische Landesbank walked away in\n2009, may need about 1.5 billion euros in state aid by October\nto meet regulators\u2019 capital requirements. That\u2019s after taxpayers\nalready injected 1.35 billion euros.  Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter has in the past\nrejected proposals for such a model. She told journalists\nearlier this week that such plans would have to be approved by\nthe EU, and that Austria wasn\u2019t seeking such approvals\ncurrently.  For more, click here.  Compliance Policy  U.K. Softens Vickers\u2019 Bank Plan on Capital, Prompting Criticism  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne softened the\nrecommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking on how\nmuch capital lenders must hold, prompting criticism from the\nreport\u2019s author.  In the government\u2019s first detailed response to the\nproposals made by former Bank of England Chief Economist John\nVickers, the Treasury said that banks will only have to hold 3\npercent of capital against total assets in line with Basel III\nrequirements rather than the 4.06 percent recommended in the\nICB\u2019s September report. That will make it less costly for banks.  Osborne is adopting the overwhelming majority of the\nVickers report, which recommended that banks separate consumer\nand investment banking operations and each have a separate board\nwith at least two thirds of their members sitting on only one\nboard. Banks will also be forced to have their own risk\ncommittees.  In a further softening of the ICB\u2019s proposals, Britain will\nallow the consumer units of banks operating in the U.K. to hedge\ncurrencies and some simple derivatives for small and mid-sized\ncompanies. More complex derivatives trades won\u2019t be allowed.\nVickers last year proposed all those functions remain outside\nthe consumer operations of a bank.  The opposition Labour Party attacked Osborne for not\npresenting the plans in Parliament.  The Treasury plans to pass all legislation relating to\nVickers recommendations by 2015 and fully implement them by\n2019, resisting pressure from the industry to slow down their\nadoption.

NYC Loses Jobs With Overseas Rule Exemptions, Gensler Says  New York financial firms would move jobs overseas if the\nU.S. grants the industry\u2019s request to exempt companies\u2019 foreign\nbranches from some Dodd-Frank Act rules, said  Gary Gensler ,\nchairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Gensler made the remarks yesterday in an interview on\nBloomberg Television.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are among\nU.S. firms to argue that applying Dodd-Frank rules to their\noverseas branches or subsidiaries would threaten their ability\nto compete with foreign-based rivals. Imposing the law\u2019s margin\nrequirements on non-U.S. swaps would \u201ceviscerate our ability to\nserve clients overseas and cede the global market,\u201d JPMorgan\nAssociate General Counsel Don Thompson said at a House hearing\nFeb. 8.  The CFTC is set to propose guidance on June 21 on how the\nU.S. may govern the international reach of Dodd-Frank rules on\nderivatives, people familiar with the plan have said.  The CFTC also is planning an order providing overseas-based\nswap dealers and some affiliates of U.S. banks as much as a year\nto comply with all of Dodd-Frank regulations, Gensler said in a\nspeech prepared for an  Institute of International Bankers \u2019\nconference in New York. The delay may affect compliance with\ncapital and some risk management regulations, Gensler said.  Overseas swap dealers would still be required to register\nwith the CFTC and report trades to swap data repositories,\nGensler said. The CFTC is seeking to have a system for allowing\ncompliance with overseas regulations substitute for Dodd-Frank\nrules.  For the video, click here.  Global Bank Pay Rules Aren\u2019t Being Applied Evenly, FSB Says  International efforts to enforce a common set of rules on\nbanker pay may be hampered by diverging national positions on\nwhich staff should be covered by the measures, the Financial\nStability Board said.  There are \u201cimportant differences\u201d in how nations have\nimplemented the curbs, which were set by regulators in 2009 to\nreduce excessive risk taking, the FSB said June 13 in a report\non its website. These include a potentially \u201cwide variation\u201d\nin the range of employees that authorities target.  \u201cMember jurisdictions have made different choices\nregarding the institutions and employees that are covered,\u201d\naccording to the report, drawn up for a meeting next week of the\nGroup of 20 nations. Divergences exist even within the 27-nation\nEuropean Union, the FSB said.  Public outrage and shareholder rebellions have forced some\nbanks this year to retreat from their initial pay plans. In a\nbid to placate investors,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive Officer\nRobert Diamond agreed to forgo about 11 percent of his total\ncompensation until the bank increases profits. In a non-binding\nApril vote,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  shareholders voted to reject that\nbank\u2019s executive pay plan.  The measures are part of efforts to prevent a repeat of the\n2008 financial crisis.  Dark Pool Limits Sought in House Committee by NYSE, Nasdaq  NYSE Euronext and  Nasdaq  OMX Group Inc., the biggest owners\nof American stock exchanges, are urging U.S. legislators to\nsupport changes to rules that caused a proliferation of broker-\nrun markets that draw orders away from public venues.  Dark pools and brokers should be required to provide better\nprices than those available on exchanges or offer quotes\npublicly at the best levels, the companies said in a written\npresentation to staff of the House Committee on Financial\nServices that Bloomberg obtained. Lawmakers are holding  hearings \non the structure of U.S. markets in Washington on June 20. Dark\npools, unlike exchanges, are private venues that execute orders\nwithout displaying bids and offers in advance.  The Securities and Exchange Commission should explain why\nRegulation ATS, approved in 1998 to integrate alternative venues\nthat compete with exchanges listing stocks into the broader\nmarketplace, \u201cremains sound policy,\u201d  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  and Nasdaq\nOMX said. That rule and another set of changes the SEC approved\nin 2005 overhauled trading and led to the creation of more than\nfour dozen venues that compete with the New York Stock Exchange\nand Nasdaq. Executives at both companies have pushed for changes\nto how dark pools operate over the past three years.  Richard Adamonis , a spokesman for NYSE Euronext, and Joseph\nChristinat of Nasdaq OMX declined to comment.  Dark pools accounted for 13.6 percent of U.S. equities\nvolume in April, according to data compiled by Rosenblatt\nSecurities Inc.  For more, click here.  Compliance Action  Credit Suisse Urged by SNB to Boost Capital This Year  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  needs a \u201cmarked increase\u201d in\ncapital this year to prepare the bank for a possible worsening\nof Europe\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis, the Swiss central bank said.\nThe shares fell as much as 11 percent.  \u201cFor Credit Suisse, given the low starting point and the\nrisks in the environment, it is essential that it already\nsubstantially expand its loss-absorbing capital base during the\ncurrent year,\u201d the Swiss National Bank said in its annual\nfinancial stability  report  yesterday. The central bank said\nimprovements can be achieved by suspending dividend payments or\nselling new shares in addition to the banks\u2019 plans for cutting\nassets.  The SNB\u2019s stress scenario assumes that the euro area falls\ninto a \u201cdeep recession,\u201d which spreads to other European\ncountries including Switzerland and to the U.S. This could be\ntriggered by a disorderly default of several smaller peripheral\ncountries in the euro area, the central bank said.  Credit Suisse \u201chas been at the forefront\u201d in adapting to\nregulatory change and attaches \u201chighest priority to an\nindustry-leading capitalization,\u201d the Zurich-based lender said\nin a statement yesterday. The bank \u201chas also established\ntransparency on its plan for both building up common equity\nthrough retaining earnings and further asset reduction,\u201d Credit\nSuisse said.

Separately, the Swiss National Bank will review its\ncommunications procedures as a newspaper reported the bank\u2019s\nbrief of its annual report may have created the opportunity for\ninsider trading in Credit Suisse derivatives.  The SNB will review how it publishes its annual financial\nstability report, the central bank said in an e-mailed statement\ntoday. The bank has so far presented preliminary information to\njournalists under embargo before the official publication of the\nrelease, \u201cto explain the partly complex content of the\nreport,\u201d it said.  Credit Suisse shares plunged 10 percent to 17.01 Swiss\nfrancs yesterday after the central bank said, as part of the\n annual report , that the lender needs a \u201cmarked increase\u201d in\ncapital this year. Turnover in  puts  that give the right to sell\nCredit Suisse shares jumped on June 11, the day the SNB briefed\njournalists, Zurich-based Tages-Anzeiger reported today.  Tobias Lux, a spokesman for the Finma market regulator,\nwasn\u2019t immediately available to comment. Alain Bichsel, head of\nmedia relations at the SIX Swiss Exchange, declined to comment.  Commerzbank to Fix Money-Laundering Controls After Review  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany\u2019s second-largest lender, agreed to\nimprove its anti-money laundering program after Federal Reserve\nexaminers determined the bank failed to establish internal\ncontrols in its New York branch.  Commerzbank will submit a plan to the Fed within 60 days\ndetailing how it will revise its program for monitoring bulk\ncash transactions and improve due diligence on customers,\naccording to an enforcement action the regulator released\nyesterday.  Transactions going back to September 2010 will also be\nreviewed by a consultant and the bank.  \u201cCommerzbank has committed to take all necessary measures\nto comply with the additional compliance and reporting\nrequirements agreed with U.S. regulators,\u201d Margarita Thiel, a\nspokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based bank, said in an e-mailed\nstatement.  NYSE-Nasdaq Feud Misses Congress as Greifeld Drops Hearing  The top executives of  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and NYSE\nEuronext won\u2019t get to face off before lawmakers next week over\nhow brokers affected by  Facebook Inc. (FB) \u2019s botched initial public\noffering should be compensated.  Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer  Robert Greifeld  declined an\ninvitation to testify June 20 at a House Financial Services\ncapital markets subcommittee hearing, according to two people\nwith knowledge of the plans. The decision means Greifeld won\u2019t\nhave to spend several hours sitting at the same table as NYSE\nEuronext CEO  Duncan Niederauer , who has led the fight against\nNasdaq\u2019s compensation plan for customers affected by the glitch.  Representative Scott Garrett, the  New Jersey  Republican who\nis chairman of the subcommittee, called the hearing to discuss\nmarket-structure issues. The  Facebook IPO , however, might have\ndominated the hearing had Greifeld and Niederauer appeared\nbefore the panel together.  Executives from Direct Edge Holdings LLC,  Knight Capital\nGroup Inc. (KCG) ,  Invesco Ltd (IVZ)  and GETCO LLC have also received\ninvitations to testify, according to one of the people, who\nwasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about the planning.  Joseph Christinat, a Nasdaq spokesman, and Richard\nAdamonis, a spokesman for NYSE, declined to comment.  Courts  ECB Tells Court Releasing Greek Swap Files Would Inflame Markets  The  European Central Bank  said it can\u2019t release files\nshowing how Greece may have used derivatives to hide its\nborrowings because disclosure could still inflame the crisis\nthreatening the future of the single currency.  Bloomberg News is suing the ECB to provide the documents\nunder European Union freedom-of-information rules. The papers\nmay help show the role EU authorities played in allowing Greece\nto mask its deficit for almost a decade before the nation\u2019s\ntroubled finances necessitated a 240 billion-euro ($301 billion)\nbailout and the biggest debt restructuring in history.  Bloomberg\u2019s lawsuit, filed in December 2010, requested\naccess to two internal papers drafted for the central bank\u2019s\nsix-member Executive Board. They show how Greece used swaps to\nhide its borrowings, according to a March 3, 2010, note attached\nto the papers and obtained by Bloomberg News.  These documents \u201cplayed a role\u201d in shaping policy and\n\u201chighlighted there were issues\u201d when the ECB undertook a\nreview of its eligibility criteria for collateral in its funding\noperations, the ECB lawyer told the court.

Ex-SEC Enforcement Attorney Pleads Not Guilty to Wire Fraud  Daryl Hudson III, a former senior counsel in the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\u2019s enforcement division,\npleaded not guilty in federal court after being charged with\nseven counts of wire fraud.  Hudson, who is chairman and chief executive officer of\nHampden Kent Group LLC, was arraigned yesterday in U.S. District\nCourt in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was indicted May 23 and\nfaces as long as 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine on\neach charge if convicted.  He worked at the SEC from 1982 to 1985, according to the\nindictment.  Hudson, 59, of the District of Columbia, is accused of\nengaging in a scheme to defraud Santa Fe-based  Bluenergy\nSolarwind Inc.  by falsely representing that he could secure debt\nfunding to help the company grow, according to a statement by\nNew Mexico U.S. Attorney Kenneth J. Gonzales.  \u201cThe allegations in the indictment concern one disgruntled\nclient who, over a three-week period, misled my client about its\nbusiness and in fact could not demonstrate any product or\nrevenues to obtain financing,\u201d David A. Streubel, a lawyer for\nHudson, said in an e-mail yesterday.  When the full story is explained in court, he said, \u201cMr.\nHudson will be completely exonerated.\u201d  The case is U.S. v. Hudson, 12-01250, U.S. District Court,\nDistrict of New Mexico (Albuquerque).  SEC Seeks to Reinstate Claims Against Goldman Sachs\u2019s Tourre  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked a court\nto reinstate fraud claims it dismissed against  Fabrice Tourre ,\nthe  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  trader accused of misleading\ninvestors in a collateralized debt obligation.  U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan last June\nthrew out some of the SEC\u2019s claims after Tourre argued that he\ncouldn\u2019t be held liable under U.S. securities law for foreign\ntransactions that occurred outside the country. Jones cited a\n2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that U.S. securities laws don\u2019t\nprotect foreign investors who buy stocks on overseas exchanges.  The SEC initially sued the London-based trader in April\n2010, saying he defrauded investors by not disclosing that hedge\nfund Paulson & Co. had helped pick the underlying securities for\na CDO called Abacus and planned to bet against them. After\nreaching a $550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman\nSachs, the SEC filed a new claim against Tourre, saying he gave\nthe company \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d as it misled investors.  Pamela Rogers Chepiga, a lawyer representing Tourre, didn\u2019t\nimmediately return a call seeking comment on the SEC\u2019s filing\nafter regular business hours.  The case is SEC v. Tourre, 10-03229, U.S. District Court,\nSouthern District of New York (Manhattan).  Stanford Gets 110-Year Sentence for $7 Billion Ponzi Scheme  R. Allen Stanford, found guilty of leading a $7 billion\ninternational fraud, was sentenced to 110 years in prison after\na prosecutor said he treated his victims like \u201croad kill.\u201d  U.S. District Judge David Hittner imposed the sentence\nyesterday in Houston and ordered Stanford to forfeit\n$5.9 billion. Jurors in March convicted the Stanford Financial\nGroup principal of 13 charges, including five counts of mail\nfraud and four of wire fraud.  The jury had found Stanford, 62, lied to those who bought\ncertificates of deposit issued by his Antigua-based Stanford\nInternational Bank Ltd. and sold in the U.S. by his Houston-\nbased securities firm. Prosecutors said Stanford wasted investor\nmoney on failing businesses, yachts and cricket tournaments and\nsecretly borrowed as much as $2 billion from his bank.  Defense lawyer Ali Fazel said there would be an appeal.  \u201cWe\u2019re very disappointed in the outcome,\u201d Fazel said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a harsh punishment, and it\u2019s tough on him. He is upset\nbecause he feels like he didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d  \u201cI never planned to, never did, either corporately or\npersonally, defraud anyone and never set out to do that,\u201d\nStanford told the judge.  Prosecutors had asked for a 230-year term, the maximum\nunder federal sentencing guidelines. Fazel requested a 10-year\nterm for his client.  The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S. District\nCourt, Southern District of Texas (Houston).
