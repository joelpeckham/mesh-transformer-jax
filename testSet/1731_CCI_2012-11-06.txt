The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRoyal KPN NV (KPN) , the Dutch phone company\npartly owned by Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim , is nearing an\nagreement to sell its German mobile-phone towers to  American\nTower Corp. (AMT) , according to people familiar with the matter.  American Tower has won the bidding against Swedish private-\nequity firm EQT Partners AB and the group of Antin\nInfrastructure Partners and TDF Group, said the people, who\nasked not to be identified because talks are private. The U.S.\nowner and operator of wireless broadcast sites, based in  Boston ,\nmay pay between 300 million euros ($383 million) and 400 million\neuros, they said.  \u201cKPN can certainly use the cash, as they\u2019re taking part in\nthe Dutch spectrum auction, and owning these towers is not\nnecessarily part of their core business,\u201d said Frank Claassen,\nan analyst at Rabobank International.  Final negotiations are ongoing and could still fall apart,\nwith a deal potentially announced by next week, said the people.\nKPN spokesman Stefan Simons declined to comment and officials at\nAmerican Tower, EQT and Antin Infrastructure did not immediately\nreturn calls for comment.  KPN, which has been selling mobile towers since 2008,\nagreed last week to sell part of its Dutch mobile towers to\nIndonesia\u2019s Protelindo as it tries to strengthen its balance\nsheet. To raise cash, the Hague-based firm tried unsuccessfully\nto sell Belgian mobile-phone unit Base and ended discussions on\na potential merger involving its German E-Plus wireless unit and\n Telefonica SA (TEF) \u2019s business in Germany.  Changing Behavior  KPN said last month that third-quarter profit fell 32\npercent amid increasing German price competition and declining\nmobile subscription revenue. KPN is struggling with changing\nconsumer behavior as smartphone customers communicate more via\nmessaging technology such as WhatsApp or with calling software\nsuch as Skype.  The company\u2019s shares rose 2.4 percent to 4.89 euros at the\nclose in Amsterdam, the biggest gain since Oct. 10.  Wireless carriers, including  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and Sprint\nNextel Corp., have sold towers, which carry transmission\nequipment, to companies that specialize in their management. The\nphone companies then pay the tower operator for using the\ninfrastructure.  Deutsche Telekom\u2019s  T-Mobile USA  agreed in September to sell\nthe rights to operate 7,200 cellular towers to  Crown Castle\nInternational Corp. (CCI)  for $2.4 billion, providing cash to invest\nin the carrier\u2019s U.S. wireless network.
