 "context": "The following article called 'Virgin, Novartis, Qualcomm, Dotcom: Intellectual Property' was published on 2013-07-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRichard Branson \u2019s Virgin Atlantic\nAirways Ltd. said it will exit aircraft seat manufacturing,\nhours after losing a six-year legal dispute over the patent on\nits premium berths.  Virgin plans to sell the engineering department of its\nThreesixty Aerospace unit to  Zodiac Aerospace SA (ZC)  after the U.K.\nSupreme Court ruled that the French company -- the world\u2019s\nbiggest maker of aircraft seats -- isn\u2019t liable for 49 million\npounds ($75 million) in damages sought by the airline.  Founded as Reynard Aviation in 1998 to help Virgin compete\nwith new products from British Airways,  Threesixty  worked with\nContour Premium Aircraft Seating to produce the J2000 berth and\nits successor, the flat-bed Upper Class Suite. A rift developed\nwhen Contour, later bought by Zodiac, sought to supply seats of\na similar design to carriers including  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)   \u201cThe business needs to focus on what it does best, which\nis designing and delivering products that our passengers love,\u201d\nVirgin said in an e-mailed statement.  Zodiac said separately that the purchase, for which it\ndidn\u2019t disclose a value, involves activities at Threesixty\nemploying about 20 people.  Britain\u2019s highest court ruled July 3 that Zodiac Seats U.K.\nLtd. of Cwmbran,  Wales , isn\u2019t liable for damages even after an\nearlier hearing ruled in Virgin\u2019s favor. That\u2019s because the\ncarrier amended the patent on its Upper Class seats following\nthe original decision in the wake of a European Patent Office\nruling that went against the U.K. judgment.  The July 3 ruling covers just one element of the\n intellectual property  dispute, Virgin spokeswoman Louise Holding\nsaid in a separate statement, adding that the carrier invests\nheavily in innovation to differentiate its product from rivals.  Zodiac Aerospace acquired its U.K. business via last year\u2019s\npurchase of Contour from Premium Aircraft Interiors Group Ltd.,\nowned by a Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc investment vehicle.\nThe company, based in Plaisir, near Paris, employs 30,000 people\nand has annual sales of 3.4 billion euros ($4.4 billion).  Threesixty Aerospace, based in Brackley, central England,\nreferred questions to Virgin Atlantic.  Novartis Sues Intas Pharmaceuticals for Patent Infringement  Novartis (HCBA)  AG sued  Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (INTAS)  for patent\ninfringement, claiming it sought U.S. approval to sell a generic\nversion of the immunosuppressant drug Myfortic before Novartis\u2019s\npatents expired.  Novartis, in a filing July 3 in federal court in\nWashington, seeks to block Intas and its U.S. unit, Accord\nHealthcare Inc., from importing and selling generic Myfortic in\nthe U.S. until its patents expire April 2017.  Novartis, based in Basel, Switzerland, alleges its patents\nwere violated when Intas filed a new drug application with the\nU.S.  Food and Drug Administration  seeking to manufacture and\nsell 180 milligram delayed-release tablets of generic Myfortic,\nclaiming Novartis\u2019s patents are invalid.  The medication is used to treat patients who have had\nkidney transplants.  \u201cDefendants products, if approved, will be administered to\nhuman patients in an amount effective to immunosuppress those\npatients, which administration constitutes direct\ninfringement,\u201d Frederick Haughey, a lawyer for Novartis, wrote\nin the complaint.  Chid Iyer, a lawyer for Ahmedabad, India-based Intas\nPharmaceuticals at Sughrue Mion Pllc in Washington, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment on the\nlawsuit.  The case is  Novartis AG (NOVN)  v. Accord Healthcare Inc. USA, 13-cv-01013, U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia \n(Washington).  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  Qualcomm Applies for Trademark to Be Used With SmartWatch  Qualcomm Inc., the maker of digital wireless communications\nequipment, may be planning to come out with a wristwatch mobile\ntelephone, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Patent and\nTrademark Office.  The San Diego-based company filed an application with the\npatent office June 26 to register \u201cQualcomm TOQ\u201d as a\ntrademark.  The company said in its application that it will use the\nmark with \u201cpersonal communication hub in the form of a\nwristwatch; portable electronic devices for transmitting and\nreviewing text, data, image, and audio files; hands-free devices\nfor mobile phones; battery chargers.\u201d  While  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  has filed a trademark applications in\nJapan for an \u201ciWatch\u201d trademark, as of July 3 the Cupertino,\nCalifornia-based company hadn\u2019t filed a comparable application\nin the U.S., according to the patent office database.  Both Apple and Qualcomm may be coming late to the party,\nhowever.  Pebble Technology Corp. , a watchmaker that raised more\nthan $10.2 million on crowdfunding website Kickstarter, has a\nsmart watch that will beat both to the market. Pebble\u2019s\nsmartwatch will be available in  Best Buy Co. (BBY)  stores beginning\nJuly 7.  The $150 watch, which is compatible with devices that run\nboth Apple\u2019s iOS and  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s Android mobile software, is\nalready available on Best Buy\u2019s and Pebble\u2019s websites.  Nestle Barred From Registering Kit Kat Shape as U.K. Trademark  Nestle SA (NESN) , the world\u2019s biggest food company, can\u2019t register\nthe shape of its Kit Kat bar as a trademark in the U.K.,\nConfectionery News  reported .  The U.K.\u2019s Intellectual Property Office in a June 20\nruling, rejected the application from the Vevey, Switzerland-based company, which had been opposed by  Mondelez International\nInc. (MDLZ) \u2019s Cadbury unit, according to Confectionery News.  The U.K.  ruling  is at odds with a finding from the Board of\nAppeals Office for the Harmonization in the Internal Market,\nwhich registers trademarks in the European Union and allowed\nregistration of the shape, Confectionery News reported.  The hearing officer for the U.K.\u2019s IP office said the\nreason his ruling excludes the registration is that he was\nprovided more expert evidence than the Board of Appeals had,\naccording to Confectionery News.

Prime Minister at Heated Spy-Law Hearing  Megaupload.com founder Kim Dotcom accused  New Zealand  Prime\nMinister John Key of lying as the two clashed at a parliamentary\nhearing on new spying laws.  Dotcom came face-to-face with Key July 3 for the first time\nsince armed police stormed his Auckland-suburb mansion in\nJanuary last year and his cloud-storage Internet site was shut\ndown by the U.S. on piracy charges. He sparred with Key, who\ndenied knowing about the Internet entrepreneur before the raid.  Key knew of him \u201cwell before the raid,\u201d Dotcom said.\n\u201cYou know I know,\u201d he said, turning to the prime minister and\ndrawing laughter from the gallery. \u201cWhy are you turning red\nprime minister?\u201d  \u201cWhy are you sweating?\u201d Key replied.  \u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d Dotcom retorted.  The confrontation took place at a hearing into new\nlegislation that was prompted by Dotcom\u2019s arrest in what the\nU.S. calls the biggest copyright infringement case in its\nhistory. New Zealand\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, the\nGovernment Communications & Security Bureau, was revealed to\nhave illegally spied on Dotcom as part of the U.S.-led\noperation.  Key argues that New Zealand\u2019s Security Intelligence Service\ncan already collect information on citizens, and that the laws\ngoverning the GCSB need to be clarified and brought up to date\nin a rapidly changing cyber-security environment.  The new law is \u201cmorally indefensible\u201d and would set New\nZealand on the same path as the U.S., which is facing\naccusations of mass cyber surveillance after leaks by former\nnational security contractor Edward Snowden, Dotcom said.  \u201cWe should avoid blindly following the U.S. into the dark\nages of spying abuse,\u201d he said.  Key apologized to Dotcom in September for the GCSB\u2019s\nactivity. Dotcom, 39, has sued the GCSB for intercepting his\ncommunications. He is scheduled to face a hearing on his\nextradition to the U.S. next month.  Dotcom was indicted in January 2012 in Virginia on charges\nof racketeering,  money laundering , copyright infringement and\n wire fraud .  The New Zealand case is Between Kim Dotcom and Attorney\nGeneral. CIV2012-404-001928.  High Court  of New Zealand\n(Auckland). The U.S. case is USA v. Dotcom, 12-cr-00003, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria).  For more copyright news, click here.  Obituary  Douglas Engelbart, Computer Mouse Creator, Visionary, Dies at 88  Douglas Engelbart, the visionary electrical engineer who\ninvented the computer mouse decades before the influx of\npersonal computers into homes and workplaces, has died. He was\n88.  He died July 3 at his home in Atherton, California, the  New\nYork  Times reported, citing his wife, Karen O\u2019Leary Engelbart.\nThe cause was kidney failure.  Engelbart\u2019s work at the Stanford Research Institute,\ntoday\u2019s SRI International, resulted in 21 patents. The last one,\n No. 3,541,541 , filed in 1967 and granted in 1970, was for the\ncomputer mouse, or as it was described in technical terms:  \u201cAn X-Y position indicator control for movement by the\nhand over any surface to move a cursor over the display on a\ncathode ray tube, the indicator control generating signals\nindicating its position to cause a cursor to be displayed on the\ntube at the corresponding position.\u201d  He had devised the palm-sized, wheel-based instrument in\n1963 as a way to move a computer-screen cursor by means other\nthan arrows on a keyboard. Other alternatives being weighed at\nthe time were a light-pen pointed at the screen, a tracking ball\nand a joystick.  On Dec. 9, 1968, at a computer conference in San Francisco,\nEngelbart unveiled his team\u2019s work in a presentation that became\nknown in tech circles as \u201cthe mother of all demos.\u201d During the\n90-minute session, linked to his lab by a homemade modem,\nEngelbart showed off then-novel feats including interactive\ncomputing, video conferencing, windows display and hypertext --\nplus the rectangular, three-button controller he used to control\nthe cursor on the screen.  \u201cI don\u2019t know why we call it a mouse,\u201d he told his\naudience that day. \u201cSometimes I apologize. It started that way\nand we never did change it.\u201d  The rationale for the name, he said in other interviews,\nwas quite simple: the device resembled the rodent, with its cord\nas a tail. He said nobody on his team could remember who used\nthe term first.  Engelbart had four children -- daughters Gerda, Diana and\nChristina, and son Norman -- with his first wife, the former\nBallard Fish, who died in 1997. He married the former Karen\nO\u2019Leary in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nVictoria Slind-Flor in Oakland, California, at   vslindflor@bloomberg.net .
