 "context": "The following article called 'Pharmacyclics Blood-Cancer Drug Controls Disease in Study' was published on 2012-12-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPharmacyclics Inc. (PCYC) \u2019s experimental\ntreatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a blood cancer that\naffects adults 50 and older, slowed progression of the disease\nwhen used alone and with another drug, studies showed.  In a study of 116 patients, the medicine, called ibrutinib,\nhelped control the malignancy in 68 percent who hadn\u2019t been\npreviously treated for the blood cancer and in 71 percent of\nthose who had relapsed or were at risk for relapse, Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia-based Pharmacyclics said today in a statement.  Ibrutinib is from a new class of medicines for chronic\nlymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, a cancer that  strikes  about 16,000\nAmericans a year at a median age of about 72. The goal is to use\nthe drug without chemotherapy, a standard treatment that can be\ntoo toxic for some elderly patients. The drug may generate as\nmuch as $5 billion a year if approved for CLL and other blood\ncancers, said  Michael Yee , an RBC Capital Markets analyst.  \u201cWe are very encouraged that these results with ibrutinib\ncontinue to support the possibility that we can address some of\nthe critical unmet needs,\u201d  John Byrd , leukemia research\nprofessor at Ohio State University Medical Center and lead study\nauthor, said in the statement.  Results also showed that 96 percent of patients in the\npreviously untreated group, and 75 percent of those at high\nrisk, lived 26 months without the disease worsening. The most\ncommon side effects were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and rash. The\nfindings showed no evidence of cumulative toxicity or long-term\nsafety concerns, according to the statement.  Blood Malignancy  CLL originates from white blood cells in bone marrow and\ncan spread to the liver, lymph nodes and spleen, according to\nthe  American Cancer Society . The disease may spread for years\nwithout any symptoms, and many patients aren\u2019t treated.  In a second study of 40 patients, ibrutinib worked in\ncombination with  Roche Holding AG\u2019s (ROG)  Rituxan. The drug helped\ncontrol the cancer in 83 percent.  Thirty-eight of the 40\npatients continued on the therapy without their disease\nworsening at a follow-up of three to six months. Results from\nthe studies will be formerly presented tomorrow at the  American\nSociety of Hematology  meeting in Atlanta.  Ibrutinib is designed to go after an enzyme within the so-\ncalled Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase pathway that enables abnormal\nwhite blood cells to proliferate. It is currently being tested\nin last of three phases of trials typically required for U.S.\napproval. Pharmacyclics is developing the drug with  New\nBrunswick , New Jersey-based  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , the world\u2019s\nbiggest health-care products company.  Slow-Growing  Because one form of CLL is slow growing, doctors typically\ndon\u2019t treat these patients, Pharmacyclics said in the statement.\nOthers who have a more aggressive form are given a three-drug\ncombination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and Rituxan.  This can be toxic for elderly patients, attacking cancerous\nand healthy cells,  Jan Burger , an associate professor at The\nUniversity of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said\nin an interview.  \u201cWe always hoped we\u2019d find something that\u2019s more targeted\nthat damages the leukemia cells but not the patient,\u201d Burger, a\nconsultant to Pharmacyclics who authored one of the company\u2019s\nstudies presented at the meeting. \u201cAnd ibrutinib is one of\nthese very promising new drugs.\u201d  Pharmacyclics shares gained $1.01, or 1.8 percent, to close\nat $56.02 yesterday in  New York . The share have more than\n tripled  this year on the drug\u2019s prospects.
