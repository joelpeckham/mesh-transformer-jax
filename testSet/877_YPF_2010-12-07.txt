 "context": "The following article called 'Repsol Makes Argentina's Largest Gas Find in 35 Years in Neuquen Province' was published on 2010-12-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRepsol YPF SA , Spain\u2019s largest oil\ncompany, found 4.5 trillion cubic feet of unconventional natural\ngas in Argentina, the country\u2019s largest discovery in 35 years.  Repsol found so-called tight gas reserves at the Loma\nLa Lata area in the Patagonian province of Neuquen after its YPF\nunit drilled four exploratory wells in the region, according to \na statement from Madrid-based Repsol today. The company also said\nthat it discovered so-called shale gas in the province.  Crude output at YPF, the biggest Argentina-based company by\nmarket value, climbed in the first nine months of the year for\nthe first time since 2003 as Chief Executive Officer  Sebastian Eskenazi  seeks to grow in Argentina and neighboring markets. The\ncompany plans to invest as much as $3.5 billion a year in\ncountries such as Brazil and Colombia as Argentine output slows.  \u201cThis is a new frontier,\u201d Repsol Chief Executive Officer\n Antonio Brufau  said today of the discovery in an interview in\nBuenos Aires. The find \u201cis very important for Argentina and\nYPF, and therefore for Repsol,\u201d he said.  The find boosts Loma La Lata\u2019s reserves five-fold,\naccording to the Argentine government\u2019s website. Repsol also\nplans to work with Vale SA to jointly produce gas for a potash\nmine Vale plans in Argentina, Eskenazi said at a news conference\nin Buenos Aires.  \u2018Redouble Efforts\u2019  The gas discovery \u201cmakes us all redouble our efforts to\nmaintain and strengthen Argentina\u2019s fiscal and trade surplus,\nand the accumulation of reserves and reduction of Argentina\u2019s\ndebt,\u201d President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said.  YPF, the country\u2019s largest employer, produces and processes\nabout 50 percent of the South American nation\u2019s oil and controls\nabout as much of the domestic fuel market.  Repsol surged 65 centavos, or 3.3 percent, to 20.35 euros\nin Madrid, after earlier gaining as much as 4.1 percent.  Last month, Repsol said it plans to raise as much as $2.36\nbillion through the sale of a 15 percent stake in the unit as it\nseeks to reduce its holdings in the Latin American nation.  Today\u2019s find is the largest since gas was first found at\nLoma La Lata more than three decades ago.  The YPF find may contain enough gas to supply the country\nfor as much as 50 years, Agustin Rossi, head of the ruling\nPeronist party in the lower house of Congress, said in an\ninterview earlier today on Argentina\u2019s C5N television.  Uncovers Oil  Drilling at the field also has uncovered some oil,\naccording to Eskenazi. Shale gas is natural gas produced from\nshale, while tight gas is so named because it is difficult to\naccess, trapped by surrounding rock and sand.  YPF may invest $3 billion to $3.5 billion a year to grow in\nBrazil, Colombia, Mexico and Canada, Eskenazi said in a May\ninterview in New York. Overseas sales will account for 50\npercent of total revenue in 10 years, up from 30 percent now, he\nsaid.  Crude oil for January delivery declined 44 cents, or 0.5\npercent, to $88.94 a barrel at 10:56 a.m. on the New York\nMercantile Exchange. The contract touched $90.76, the highest\nintraday price since Oct. 8, 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:\n Rodrigo Orihuela  in Buenos Aires at  rorihuela@bloomberg.net .
