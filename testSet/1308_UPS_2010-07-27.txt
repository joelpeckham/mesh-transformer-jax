 "context": "The following article called 'FedEx, UPS Signal Export-Led U.S. Growth Momentum' was published on 2010-07-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFedEx Corp. and United Parcel\nService Inc., two bellwethers of the U.S. economy, are signaling\ndurability of a global recovery powered by growth overseas\nrather than demand at home.  \n Both freight companies raised profit forecasts in recent\ndays on the strength of cross-border shipments, especially from\nAsia, reflecting confidence in trade flows even as the European\ndebt crisis threatens to weaken global demand.  \n While rising international deliveries suggest that a\n\u201cdouble-dip\u201d recession is unlikely for the global economy,\nthey reinforce forecasts for export-driven growth amid a lengthy\nperiod of unemployment around 9 percent in the U.S. The reliance\non foreign demand bolsters a theory espoused by Pacific\nInvestment Management Co. that the world\u2019s largest economy is in\na \u201cnew normal\u201d phase of slow growth.  \n \u201cThe international marketplace is what\u2019s driving growth at\nFedEx and UPS and any other big company that has international\nexposure right now,\u201d said  David Campbell , an analyst at\nThompson Davis & Co. in Richmond, Virginia. He recommends buying\nshares of both FedEx and UPS.  \n FedEx, based in Memphis, and UPS are considered gauges of\neconomic strength or weakness because they move consumer goods\nand business equipment from electronics to apparel and financial\ndocuments.  \n The two companies also raised their earnings forecasts\nearlier this year. The last time they previously raised earnings\nforecasts in tandem, in July 2005 and September 2005, the U.S.\neconomy experienced sustained growth of 3 percent for the\nfollowing year.  \n Rising Shares  \n Shares  of FedEx rose 5.6 percent yesterday and are up 19\npercent from a 2010 low reached June 30. UPS shares gained 1.9\npercent and have risen 16 percent from their low of the year\nreached in February.  \n FedEx forecast in a statement released yesterday that\nearnings for the quarter ending in August will be in a range of\n$1.05 to $1.25 a share, an increase from the previous outlook of\n85 cents to $1.05. FedEx said volume for international priority\npackages will jump more than 20 percent this quarter.  \n UPS increased its full-year forecast last week to as much\nas $3.45 a share, from a previous maximum of $3.30, on improving\ndemand in Asia and Europe.  \n Unemployment has been slow to fall after reaching a 26-year\nhigh of 10.1 percent in October. The economy lost more than 8\nmillion jobs during the latest recession. So far in 2010,\ncompanies have added 593,000 jobs.  \n Unemployment Rate  \n The jobless rate, which fell to 9.5 percent in June as the\nlabor force shrank, will average 9.6 percent this year,\naccording to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of\neconomists from July 1 to July 8.  \n Barton Biggs , the hedge-fund manager who sold half his\nequity holdings at the start of this month, said yesterday that\nhe has reversed course and is building up stock investments\nafter concluding the risk of a new global downturn has receded.  \n \u201cI\u2019ve definitely changed my mind to the degree of risk out\nthere,\u201d Biggs, managing partner of Traxis Partners LLC, said in\na radio interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Surveillance.\n\u201cEconomic data around the world in the last 10 days to two\nweeks has turned more positive. It has exceeded forecasts almost\nwithout exception. The odds of the world slumping into a\nsignificant slowdown has diminished.\u201d  \n Global gross domestic product will grow in the second half\nof the year at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent on a\npurchasing power parity basis, said  Joseph Lupton , senior\neconomist at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \n Final Sales  \n \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for a fundamental break in the recovery\nin any way,\u201d Lupton said. The global economy is in the midst of\n\u201ca natural downshift\u201d as factories cycle from orders driven\nprimarily by inventory replenishment to business more reliant on\nfinal sales.  \n Growth in Asia is being propelled largely by demand for\nelectronic components, fashion apparel and industrial parts from\ncountries including Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and India,\nsaid Campbell of Thompson Davis.  \n \u201cThe inventory stocking that started a year ago is\ncontinuing, but not at the levels we\u2019ve historically seen,\u201d\nCampbell said. \u201cCompanies are keeping fewer parts on hand,\nwhich means if they need a product or component, they have to\nuse airfreight and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with FedEx and\nUPS.\u201d  \n Airfreight Capacity  \n FedEx and UPS are also benefiting from a reduction in\nairfreight capacity over the last three years as carriers parked\nplanes and passenger airlines including  Delta Air Lines Inc., \nthe world\u2019s largest carrier, got rid of dedicated freighters.  \n There are about  2,800 freight planes  in service as of\nApril, 200 fewer than at the end of 2008, according to the\nInternational Air Transport Association, a Geneva-based trade\ngroup.  \n FedEx didn\u2019t forecast volume for the U.S. in the current\nquarter, other than saying that growth in the Express and Ground\nunits is \u201cbetter-than-expected.\u201d  \n Volumes for U.S. packages in the Express unit have risen no\nmore than 3.5 percent in each of the past four quarters, and\nfell in each of the previous 12 quarters on economic weakness\nand competition from UPS and  Deutsche Post AG\u2019s  DHL Express\nunit.  \n In typical economic cycles, UPS\u2019s domestic volume typically\nmatches or exceeds U.S. GDP.  \n Package Volume  \n The Atlanta-based company said last week that U.S. package\nvolume rose 1.2 percent for the second quarter, the best result\nin two-and-a-half years.  \n Domestic shipments will continue to grow roughly in line\nwith GDP for the rest of the year, UPS said, and it forecast\nindustrial production in the U.S. will outpace GDP.  \n \u201cThe business-to-business side is pretty good. The\nconsumer is another question. The more attached to consumers you\nare, the more risk,\u201d  Kurt Kuehn , chief financial officer of\nUPS, said in an interview on July 22.  \n UPS posted a 20 percent jump in international shipments for\nthe second quarter, the best results for that unit in four\nyears, led by a 40 percent surge in export volumes from Asia.  \n \u201cGrowth in Asia has been red hot, fueled by the tech\nsector and iPhones and handheld devices, and air freight is\ngoing to benefit greatly from that,\u201d said  Mark Vitner , an\neconomist at Wells Fargo Securities LLC in Charlotte, North\nCarolina. \u201cThis says more about the global economy and in\nparticular Asia than it does the U.S.\u201d  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Mike Dorning  in Washington at \n mdorning@bloomberg.net ;\n Mary Jane Credeur  in Atlanta at \n mcredeur@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Barton Biggs, managing partner at Traxis Partners LLC.
