 "context": "The following article called 'Obama Focuses on Taxing High Earners in Proposing Dividend Shift in Budget' was published on 2012-02-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPresident  Barack Obama  called for\n$1.4 trillion in fresh revenue from Americans at the top of the\nincome scale, proposing higher taxes on wages and investments\nand limiting breaks for retirement savings and health insurance.  The tax proposals in the administration\u2019s fiscal 2013\nbudget plan, released yesterday, were immediately rejected by\nbusiness groups and congressional Republicans, who said the\nideas are part of Obama\u2019s re-election strategy and gave them\nlittle chance of advancing into law in 2012.  \u201cWhether this occurs in Congress this year or this is the\ntax platform for this year\u2019s election, it\u2019s disconcerting for\nbusinesses,\u201d said  Caroline Harris , chief tax counsel at the\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation\u2019s largest business group.  In what he billed a bid for tax fairness and deficit\nreduction, Obama reversed his previous policy of taxing\ndividends more lightly than wage income. The budget plan would\nraise $206.4 billion over 10 years by treating dividends as\nordinary income for married couples making more than $250,000 a\nyear and individuals making more than $200,000.  \u201cWe simply can\u2019t afford to devote $206 billion for lower\ntax rates for the highest-income Americans,\u201d  Gene Sperling ,\nWhite House director of the National Economic Council, told\nreporters. \u201cOur system for taxing investment income for the\nmost well-off Americans is clearly broken.\u201d  Higher Rates  Obama is proposing a top  individual income tax  rate of 39.6\npercent in 2013, up from 35 percent. His budget would tax long-\nterm  capital gains  at a top rate of 20 percent, up from 15\npercent. The top dividend tax rate is now 15 percent.  An additional 3.8 percent tax on the unearned income of\ncouples earning $250,000 and individuals making at least\n$200,000 will take effect next year as part of the 2010 health-\ncare law. As a result, under Obama\u2019s plan some taxpayers would\npay 43.4 percent in federal taxes on their dividends next year.\nThat\u2019s almost triple what they now pay and comes on top of\ncorporate taxes.  A coalition of companies, including AT&T Inc. and  United\nParcel Service Inc. (UPS) , has been lobbying to maintain the current\nrates on capital gains and dividends. Democratic leaders in\nCongress may take their cues from Obama and propose a higher tax\nrate on dividends than on capital gains, said Jim McCrery, a\nlobbyist for the coalition.  \u201cThere was some comfort in knowing that the president was\nsupporting a top rate for both of 20 percent, and now that\u2019s\nbeen taken away,\u201d said McCrery, a former Republican member of\nCongress from  Louisiana  who sat on the House Ways and Means\nCommittee.  Policy Difference  Clint Stretch, managing principal of tax policy at Deloitte\nTax LLP in Washington, said the administration\u2019s proposal to tax\ndividends at higher rates than capital gains is surprising,\nbecause such gains tend to go to those with the highest incomes.  \u201cWhat is the policy difference that the administration has\nsuddenly found between qualified dividends and capital gains?\u201d\nhe said. \u201cWhy do they get different rates now?\u201d  The administration also wants to impose a 30 percent\nminimum tax for individuals with annual incomes of at least $1\nmillion, known as the Buffett rule after billionaire investor\n Warren Buffett , who originated the idea last year.  That would replace the alternative minimum tax, \u201cwhich now\nburdens middle-class Americans rather than stopping the richest\nAmericans from paying too little as was originally intended,\u201d\nthe administration said.  Tax Code Rewrite  Sperling said the AMT would be eliminated as part of a\nbroader rewrite of the U.S. tax code. The administration hasn\u2019t\nmade such a proposal, and the budget released yesterday didn\u2019t\ninclude repealing the AMT or imposing the Buffett rule.  Obama\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t say how much revenue the Buffett\nrule would generate and it doesn\u2019t provide details on how the\nproposal would affect individuals\u2019 tax calculations. The U.S.\ncollected $39.1 billion from the alternative minimum tax in\n2011, according to projections from the  Tax Policy  Center, a\nnonpartisan research organization in Washington.  The budget plan revives calls to allow the 2001 and 2003\ntax cuts for income and capital gains to expire at the end of\n2012 for families earning more than $250,000 a year. Obama wants\nto raise the top estate tax rate to 45 percent from 35 percent\nand lower the exemption amount to less than $4 million from more\nthan $5 million. Obama proposes capping at 28 percent itemized\ndeductions and other tax benefits for high-earning families.  Municipal Bond Interest  The list of capped tax breaks includes municipal bond\ninterest and employer-sponsored health insurance. In its budget,\nthe administration expanded the proposal to include\ncontributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as\n401(k) plans.  The president\u2019s plan would tax the profits-based\ncompensation paid to private equity managers at ordinary income\nrates instead of a preferential 15 percent rate. It also would\ncurtail tax breaks for corporate jets and oil and gas companies.  Obama reintroduced previous years\u2019 proposals to limit U.S.\ncompanies\u2019 ability to defer taxation on income earned overseas.\nHe proposed new breaks for businesses that hire more workers,\nmanufacture advanced vehicles, make capital investments or bring\njobs into the U.S.  \u201cThis is not an integrated plan for  tax reform ,\u201d said\nHank Gutman, principal in charge of federal tax legislative and\nregulatory services at KPMG LLP in  Washington . \u201cThese are ad\nhoc proposals to address issues the administration perceives as\nimportant.\u201d  Picking Winners  Representative  Dave Camp , who heads the House Ways and\nMeans Committee, said Obama\u2019s proposals wouldn\u2019t foster the\nneutral platform that businesses need to compete.  \u201cThe president has decided to play the age-old Washington\ngame of picking winners and losers and handing out favors to\nindustries he thinks will help him politically, making the code\nless fair and more complex for average Americans,\u201d said Camp, a\nMichigan Republican who is developing a tax-code overhaul.  Separately from the budget, Obama is proposing a rewrite of\nthe  corporate tax  system to eliminate tax benefits and lower the\ntop corporate rate from 35 percent. The administration plans to\nrelease more details of its corporate tax framework by the end\nof the month.  \u201cIt\u2019s easier to talk about it in the generic terms that a\nproposal coming out later could be discussed in than the\nspecifics of what goes into a budget book,\u201d said Pamela Olson,\ndeputy U.S. tax leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in\nWashington and the Treasury\u2019s top tax policy official under\nPresident  George W. Bush . \u201cYou can avoid talking about some of\nthe harsh things that you have to do in specific terms.\u201d  The administration also proposed a boost to tax enforcement\nfor the  Internal Revenue Service , increasing the agency\u2019s budget\nby 8 percent to $12.8 billion.
