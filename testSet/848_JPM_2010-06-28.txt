The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCredit investors are being \u201cpoorly\ncompensated\u201d for price volatility, sideling buyers until the\nfourth quarter, according to analysts at Barclays Capital.  \n Three-month volatility on the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of\ncredit-default swaps on investment-grade companies has more than\ndoubled to 84 percent since April, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg, while the benchmark\u2019s level has risen 60 percent.\nGreater volatility, the rate at which prices move up or down,\nmeans investors can make or lose more money than usual.  \n \u201cSpreads are wider than they were but volatility has gone\nthrough the roof,\u201d Barclays Capital credit strategist  Aziz Sunderji  said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s keeping real-money\ninvestors who are sitting on piles of cash on the sidelines.\u201d  \n Investor sentiment has been dented by \u201cvery weak\u201d sales\nof new homes in the U.S. and \u201cdovish\u201d central bank statements,\ncasting doubt on the strength of the recovery, London-based\nSunderji said. The U.S. economy grew at a 2.7 percent annual\nrate in the first quarter, less than previously calculated,\naccording to Commerce Department data.  \n The Markit iTraxx Europe index reached a two-week high of\n130.9 basis points on June 25, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nThe gauge fell 2.5 basis points today to 123.5. The index is\nnear the lowest since July 2008 when volatility is taken into\naccount, Sunderji said.  \n Unappealing Environment  \n \u201cThis is hardly an appealing environment for risk\ntaking,\u201d Sunderji said. \u201cThere are few catalysts for a\nsustained rally over the summer.\u201d  \n Sentiment should improve in the fourth quarter as\nvolatility declines and investors start to use the cash they\nhold, according to Sunderji.  \n \u201cWe expect volatility to subside, liquidity to increase\nand that will draw real-money investors into the market,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cBy then we may also have more clarity on issues such as\nbank funding and regulation.\u201d  \n Credit-default swaps are contracts based on bonds and loans\nthat are used to speculate on a company\u2019s ability to repay debt.\nAn increase indicates deterioration in the perception of credit\nquality; a decline, the opposite.  \n A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting\n$10 million of debt is equivalent to $1,000 a year.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n John Glover  in London at \n johnglover@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 29.054590225219727 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
