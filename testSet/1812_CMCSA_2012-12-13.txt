The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTom Watson , an eight-time major golf\nchampion, was named captain of the 2014 U.S. Ryder Cup team as\nthe American team will try to rebound from this year\u2019s final-day\ncollapse.  Watson will be 65 when the matches are played at the\nGleneagles Hotel in Perthshire,  Scotland , making him the oldest\nU.S. captain.  Sam Snead  was 57 when he led the U.S. team in\n1969.  The winner of five British Open titles and the U.S. captain\nin the biennial tournament between teams of U.S. and European\ngolfers in 1993, Watson was named to the post during a segment\nthis morning on the \u201cToday\u201d show on  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) \u2019s NBC\nnetwork, which televises the golf matches.  \u201cI was waiting for about 20 years to get the call,\u201d\nWatson said. \u201cI loved it the first time. It\u2019s a great honor to\nbe able to do it again. This time we need 14 1/2 points. I\u2019m a\nstage manager. I just hope I can set the stage for these players\nto perform their act.\u201d  Watson also was captain in 1993, leading the U.S. to its\nmost recent win in  Europe . Since 1981, the U.S. has prevailed in\nonly two matches on foreign soil. Watson is the first repeat\ncaptain since  Jack Nicklaus  in 1987.  The U.S. lost this year\u2019s three-day matches at Medinah\nCountry Club outside Chicago 14 1/2 to 13 1/2 as Europe equaled\nthe 13-year-old U.S. record for the biggest comeback in the\ncompetition\u2019s history. Europe entered the final day trailing 10-\n6 and outscored the U.S. 8 1/2 to 3 1/2 in 12 final-day singles\nmatches.  Of Watson\u2019s five British Open wins, four came in Scotland.\nHe played on U.S. Ryder Cup teams that won three times and tied\nonce, posting a 10-4-1 individual record, and missed capturing\nthe 2009 British Open at Turnberry in Scotland at age 59 when he\nlost in a playoff to  Stewart Cink .
