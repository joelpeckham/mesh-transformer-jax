 "context": "The following article called 'Flaherty Holds Spending to Return Canada to 2015 Balance' was published on 2013-03-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  plans to eliminate the country\u2019s deficit before the\nnext election in 2015 by limiting spending growth to the slowest\npace since the 1990s and banking on an accelerated recovery.  Flaherty\u2019s  budget  presented today projected  Canada  will\nswing to a surplus of about C$800 million in the fiscal year\nthat begins April 2015, from a C$25.9 billion deficit in the\nyear ending this month. Spending growth is forecast to average\n2.1 percent over the next five years, after rising about 26\npercent, or 4.9 percent a year, since 2007. Revenue is projected\nto grow an average 4.6 percent, more than double the current\nyear\u2019s pace, as Flaherty bets the country\u2019s  expansion  will pick\nup steam.  \u201cIt\u2019s credible, in that growth in revenue and expenditures\nare very doable and realistic,\u201d said  Michael Gregory , senior\neconomist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, even though the\n\u201cnet risk is that revenues don\u2019t live up to projection.\u201d  Flaherty is seeking to reverse a legacy of deficits that\nmay reach a cumulative C$170 billion amid the slowest expansion\nsince the 2009 recession that is hampering revenue. He\u2019s betting\nrecent efforts to restrain  government spending  will help the\ncountry keep its status as the sole Group of Seven nation with a\nstable top  credit rating .  Capital Expenses  \u201cIt requires discipline, but that discipline is being\nfollowed and it leads to a balanced budget,\u201d Flaherty, who has\nsaid he hasn\u2019t decided whether to run for office in the next\nelection, told reporters in Ottawa.  Canada is the only Group of Seven country with a stable AAA\ndebt rating from  Standard & Poor\u2019s , Moody\u2019s Investors Service\nand Fitch Ratings. Moody\u2019s said in a statement today the budget\nis in line with the government\u2019s Aaa bond rating.  Canada\u2019s currency extended gains after the budget was\nreleased. It traded at C$1.0244 per  U.S. dollar  at 5:36 p.m. in\nToronto. One Canadian dollar buys 97.62 U.S. cents.  Flaherty has pledged not to reduce transfers to individuals\nand provinces or raise taxes, other than closing loopholes, to\nspare most Canadians the brunt of deficit-cutting measures.  Instead, he is zeroing in on the C$120 billion Canada\u2019s\ngovernment spends on operating and capital expenses, which is\nless than half of total program spending.  Reducing Payrolls  The governing Conservatives lead by Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  already have been working to reduce the state payroll,\npledging to fire about 12,000 workers and cut another 7,000 jobs\nthrough attrition. Today\u2019s fiscal plans include about C$600\nmillion worth of additional savings from government over five\nyears.  Flaherty projected direct program spending excluding\npayments to individuals and provinces would drop to 5.8 percent\nof GDP in 2015 from 6.7 percent in 2012. That will decline\nfurther to 5.5 percent by 2017, near the lowest in 50 years.  Flaherty\u2019s plan also projects spending will be less than\nforecast in his last  update  in November, reflecting changes to\nhow the government accounts for budgeted expenses that never\noccur, and other factors such as weaker-than-expected inflation\nthat is reducing price-indexed payments.  Revenue though is being hampered by a slumping global\neconomy, with the government reducing its growth forecast for\nthis year to 1.6 percent, compared with a 2 percent November\nprojection. Combined with lower commodity prices, that will\nreduce revenue projections by C$14.8 billion between 2012 and\n2017, before new measures in the fiscal plan.  \u2018Consistently Wrong\u2019  \u201cStephen Harper and Jim Flaherty have consistently gotten\nit wrong with regard to their budget predictions,\u201d  Thomas Mulcair , leader of the opposition  New Democratic Party  told\nreporters in Ottawa. \u201cThe deficit was higher than had been\npredicted. Growth was lower. They\u2019re making a very high\nprediction for next year to come up with their under-C$20\nbillion deficit prediction. That will of course also have proven\nto be wrong.\u201d  One benefit from weakening global growth is lower borrowing\ncosts, reducing interest expenses by more than C$2 billion over\nthe next five years.  The government\u2019s also eliminates tariffs on baby clothing,\nimported hockey equipment and other sports equipment, a measure\nthat will cost C$76 million a year, budget documents show.  Revenue Measures  Today\u2019s plan includes revenue raising measures that include\nclosing of loopholes and steps to reduce  tax evasion , in part to\npay for new initiatives. Closing tax loopholes will generate\nanother C$4.4 billion in revenue over five years, while the\ngovernment expects to generate an additional C$2.4 billion from\nmore aggressive efforts to catch tax evaders.  Flaherty also announced he will remove 72 \u201chigher-income\u201d\ncountries, including  South Korea  and  China , from Canada\u2019s\npreferential tariff system, which allows\ngoods from developing nations lower duty rates. The change will\ncome into effect in 2015 and raise C$333 million annually.  Measures to bolster growth will cost C$6.9 billion from\n2012 to 2017, including a two-year extension on a temporary tax\nbreak and new direct funding for manufacturers who have been\nhardest hit by the global slowdown.  While total employment has increased by more than 950,000\njobs since July 2009,  manufacturing  jobs are still at near the\nlowest on record as factories struggle with the Canadian\ndollar\u2019s 45 percent gain over the past decade.  Dollar Impact  The higher dollar also has had a regional impact, with\nmanufacturing-heavy Ontario posting above national average\njobless rates in every month since June 2006. Flaherty today\nannounced new funding for a regional development agency in\nsouthern Ontario, and allocated C$1 billion for aerospace and\nmilitary manufacturers.  \u201cIt addresses the issues that are critical for the\ncompanies that are adding value to reboot the economic\nrecovery,\u201d said Jay Myers, chief executive of Canadian\nManufacturers and Exporters, an Ottawa-based advocacy group.  Much of Canada\u2019s expansion over the next year depends on a\nshift from  consumer spending , which has led growth for years, to\nbusiness investment. Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said\nFeb. 25 the \u201crotation\u201d of demand from the country\u2019s indebted\nhouseholds to businesses \u201cis the fundamental challenge\u201d for\nthe economy.  Recent evidence suggests companies are still holding back.\nCanadian investment spending will increase this year at the\nslowest pace since the 2009 recession, according to a Statistics\nCanada survey released Feb. 27, amid sluggish global demand and\nweak commodity prices.  Oil Glut  The country\u2019s energy producers are being hampered by a glut\nof supply that has constrained Canadian  oil prices , in part\nbecause of a lack of transport routes.  The price of Western Canada Select, the benchmark heavy\ncrude exported from  Alberta  to the U.S., reached a record\n discount  below the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate oil\nlast year.  Flaherty this year is reallocating existing funding to\nbegin financing grants of C$15,000 for job training, to be\njointly funded by provincial governments and employers.  The country\u2019s job vacancy rates are the highest in Alberta,\nSaskatchewan and Manitoba, according to Statistics Canada data.  \u201cThe Canadian economy certainly slowed through the second\nhalf of last year, but is expected to gradually grind higher,\u201d\n David Tulk , chief Canada macro strategist at TD Securities said\nin an interview in Ottawa. \u201cThe decisions made today are\nappropriate to reflect some of that uncertainty. The important\nthing to take away from this is recognizing that Canada does\nstand head and shoulders over many of its developed-market peers\nin ensuring that its fiscal fundamentals are very sound.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nTheophilos Argitis in Ottawa  at \n targitis@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nDavid Scanlan at \n dscanlan@bloomberg.net ;\nChris Wellisz at \n cwellisz@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was 44.80338668823242 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was ",
