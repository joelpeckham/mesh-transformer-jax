 "context": "The following article called 'SNR Denton Merger, Skadden, Wachtell: Business of Law' was published on 2012-11-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSNR Denton LLP plans a three-way\nmerger with Salans LLP of France and Canada\u2019s Fraser Milner\nCasgrain LLP in a deal that, if approved, will create a firm\nwith $1.3 billion in annual revenue.  The U.S. based firm, a product of a 2010 tie-up between\nSonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal LLP and the U.K.\u2019s Denton Wilde\nSapte LLP, will combine to create a firm with \u201cno headquarters,\nno dominant culture\u201d or geography, said Elliott Portnoy, who\nwill be the chief executive officer.  \u201cThere\u2019s an opening in the market for a new firm that\nmeets the needs of clients in a very distinct way,\u201d Portnoy\nsaid in a telephone interview today.  Senior management from all three firms will present the\ndeal to their partners on Nov. 13, with a vote planned for the\nend of the month, Portnoy said. If approved by all three, the\nmerger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013,\ncreating one of the five largest law firms globally by\nheadcount, according to data compiled by The American Lawyer\nmagazine.  The proposed deal will be structured under a so-called\nverein, allowing the firms to keep their profit pools separate.\nPortnoy will serve as global CEO and Washington D.C.-based\nJoseph Andrew as chairman.  All \u201cthe world\u2019s largest firms are either U.S., U.K., or a\ncombination of the two,\u201d Andrew said today. \u201cThis is a firm\nthat comes from all of the developed centers of the world.\u201d  Litigation  UBS Denies Claim Employees Can\u2019t Testify in Adoboli\u2019s Defense  UBS AG (UBSN) \u2019s top employment lawyer in Europe denied claims by\nformer trader Kweku Adoboli that bank workers are barred from\ntestifying in his defense at a trial over a $2.3 billion trading\nloss.  While UBS contracts may prevent current or former employees\nfrom disparaging the Zurich-based bank or sharing intellectual\nproperty, there\u2019s nothing stopping them from answering questions\nin litigation, Jamie Howard, the bank\u2019s head of employment law\nfor Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa, said today in London.  Regardless of the \u201cimplied duty of fidelity\u201d in such\ncontracts, employees may testify against the bank \u201cif required\nby law,\u201d Howard said.  Adoboli, originally from Ghana, is on trial for fraud and\nfalse accounting over the loss caused from unauthorized trades.\nProsecutors asked Howard to testify after Adoboli\u2019s lawyer\nsuggested workers were being prevented or discouraged from\nhelping bolster the former trader\u2019s defense.  Adoboli ended eight days of testimony Nov. 6 by saying  text\nmessages  between him and his girlfriend in the days before his\narrest on Sept. 14, 2011, support his claim that he didn\u2019t act\nalone. He denied allegations by prosecutors that the texts may\nhave been staged in anticipation of a future defense.  Adoboli is accused of hiding the risk of his trades by\nbooking fake hedges at the Swiss bank and then hiding profit to\ncover future losses before market fluctuations made his\npositions untenable. As part of his defense, he claimed three\nothers on the exchange-traded-funds desk knew of or took part in\nthe activities and chose to let him take the fall alone.  None of the other traders have been charged.  Argentine Judge Orders Chevron Asset Seizure, Plaintiffs Say  An Argentine judge ordered the seizure of all  Chevron\nCorp. (CVX) \u2019s assets in the country, according to Enrique Bruchou, a\nlawyer representing Ecuadorean plaintiffs in a lawsuit over\npollution in the Amazon rainforest.  Bruchou, an Argentine attorney at Bruchou, Fernandez,\nMadero & Lombardi, made the comments yesterday in a conference\ncall. Civil Judge Elcuj Miranda ordered 40 percent of Chevron\u2019s\nArgentine bank accounts to be held in escrow, Bruchou said.\nMiranda declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg.  The Ecuadorean plaintiffs said Oct. 31 they were asking an\nArgentine court to enforce a $19 billion award against Chevron,\nfiling an attachment order in a Commercial Court of Justice in\nBuenos Aires. The Ecuadoreans blame Texaco Inc., which Chevron\nacquired in 2001, for destroying the environment in the Lago\nAgrio region, damaging living conditions of 30,000 inhabitants.  Chevron is unaware of either a filing by the plaintiffs or\na court order in Argentina, James Craig, a spokesman for the  San\nRamon , California-based company said in an e-mailed response to\nquestions.  \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have no legal right to embargo\nsubsidiary assets in Argentina and should not be allowed to\ndisrupt Argentina\u2019s pursuit of its important energy resources,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThe Ecuador judgment is a product of bribery, fraud,\nand it is illegitimate.\u201d  Chevron, the fourth-largest producer of oil in Argentina,\nsigned a memorandum of understanding on Sept. 14 with  YPF SA (YPFD) ,\nArgentina\u2019s biggest energy company, to analyze a partnership to\njointly develop projects at the shale formation of Vaca Muerta.  Chevron will face more attachment requests in  Asia , Bruchou\nsaid yesterday. Another related lawsuit was filed by the\nEcuadoreans in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto\non May 30. The company on Oct. 9 lost a U.S. Supreme Court bid\nto block the judgment imposed by an Ecuadorean court. The\nhighest U.S. court let stand a federal appeals court ruling\nagainst Chevron that the Ecuadoreans can\u2019t be barred from\nseeking to collect the award anywhere in the world.
