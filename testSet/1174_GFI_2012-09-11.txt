 "context": "The following article called 'Rand Gains as Fed Optimism Outweighs S. African Current Account' was published on 2012-09-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe rand gained, erasing earlier\ndeclines, on optimism the U.S. Federal Reserve may signal\nfurther stimulus at a meeting this week.  The currency of Africa\u2019s largest economy advanced 0.2\npercent to 8.1777 a dollar at 3:19 p.m. in Johannesburg, after\nearlier retreating as much as 0.5 percent. Yields on the\nnation\u2019s 6.75 percent bonds due March 2021 dropped one basis\npoint, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.58 percent.  The Federal Open Market Committee will discuss additional\nmeasures to stimulate the  U.S. economy  at a two-day meeting\nstarting tomorrow. Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said on Aug. 31 he\nwouldn\u2019t rule out steps to lower an  unemployment rate  he\ndescribed as a \u201cgrave concern.\u201d The gap on  South Africa \u2019s\n current account , the broadest measure of trade in goods and\nservices, grew to 6.4 percent in the second quarter, the widest\nshortfall since the third quarter of 2008, from 4.9 percent of\ngross domestic product, the  Reserve Bank  said in its Quarterly\nBulletin released in Pretoria today.  \u201cGenerally, the market continues to trade with a positive\nrisk bias ahead of the much-awaited FOMC decision,\u201d  Benoit Anne , the London-based head of  emerging markets  research at\nSociete General SA, said in e-mailed comments. \u201cThe rand, which\ndid sell off earlier this morning after a particularly bad\ncurrent account number, did not waste too much time staging a\nbounce back.\u201d  Debt Crisis  A debt crisis in Europe has damped demand for exports from\na region that buys about a third of shipments from South Africa,\ncurbing  economic  growth. Manufacturing production declined 1\npercent in the second quarter, according to Statistics South\nAfrica, and the government and central bank forecast economic\nexpansion will slow to 2.7 percent this year from 3.1 percent in\n2011.  The rand is showing a \u201cweaker bias\u201d and will probably end\nthe year between 8.40 and 8.60 per dollar, with the data posing\n\u201cupside risk\u201d to the currency,  Brigid Taylor , the head of\ninstitutional flow sales at  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) \u2019s investment\nbanking unit in Johannesburg, said by phone.  The deficit swelled even as net  purchases  of South African\nbonds increased to 74.24 billion rand ($9 billion) this year, 57\npercent more than the whole of last year. South Africa\u2019s\ninclusion next month in Citigroup Inc.\u2019s World Government Bond\nIndex is luring money managers who use the gauge to measure\nperformance.  Mining Strikes  \u201cWith kind of inflows we\u2019re seeing into the bond market, I\nwould\u2019ve expected to see the deficit a little more contained --\nthat was not the case,\u201d Nedbank Capital\u2019s Taylor said. The\nreading on the current account in the second quarter doesn\u2019t\n\u201cbode well\u201d for the rest of the year, with strikes in the\nmining industry reducing output, she said.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  workers went on strike at the company\u2019s platinum\nmine in Marikana in the North West province on Aug. 10,\ndemanding higher wages. Police shot dead 34 protesters on Aug.\n16 at the Marikana operations following a week of violence in\nwhich 10 others died. Many miners have since refused to go back\nto work while unrest has spread to  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , where an\nillegal strike is under way.
