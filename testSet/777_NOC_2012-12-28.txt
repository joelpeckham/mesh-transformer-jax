 "context": "The following article called 'Lockheed Wins DoD Contracts Worth as Much $5.6 Billion' was published on 2012-12-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLockheed Martin Corp (LMT)  today received\nDefense Department contracts worth as much as $5.6 billion for\n31 additional F-35 jets and the last two of six advanced\nmilitary communications satellites, the Pentagon said.  The contracts will be immune from the automatic budget cuts\nknown as sequestration taking effect in 2013 if Congress and the\nWhite House can\u2019t negotiate an agreement to prevent more than\n$600 billion in tax increases and the spending reductions.\nPentagon officials have said that most contracts awarded before\nthe start of 2013 wouldn\u2019t be reduced.  Lockheed\u2019s  Fort Worth , Texas-based Aeronautics unit\u2019s\ncontract for a sixth installment of F-35s can\u2019t exceed $3.67\nbillion when its final details are hammered out next year. The\nPentagon said it also awarded the company\u2019s Sunnyvale,\nCalifornia, Space Systems unit a $1.93 billion contract for the\nfinal two  Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF)  satellites in\na constellation of six.  Today\u2019s so-called \u201cundefinitized contract action\u201d for the\nF-35 doesn\u2019t trigger a $3.67 billion payment to the nation\u2019s\nlargest defense contractor. Instead, it sets a threshold target\nand obligates an unspecified amount to begin assembly of 18\nconventional U.S.  Air Force  models, seven U.S. Navy variants\ndesigned to land on aircraft carriers and six U.S. Marine Corps\nshort take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) versions.  Details such as the contract\u2019s target costs, profit, cost\nceiling and overrun share line will be completed next year when\na final contract price is settled, much as those were for the\nrecently completed, $3.8 billion fifth production contract for\n32 jets.  Initial Contract  Today\u2019s initial contract doesn\u2019t include as many as five\nconventional F-35s for Italy and  Australia , or engines from the\nPratt & Whitney unit of Hartford, Connecticut-based  United\nTechnologies Corp. (UTX)   The satellite contract is a fixed-price incentive type that\nrequires Lockheed Martin to share the cost of overruns or\nmaterial failures. Contracts for the previous four AEHF\nsatellites were cost-plus types that required the Air Force to\nfoot the entire bill.  Lockheed Martin already has received about $489 million in\nadvance payments to start buying and making hard-to-get\nsatellite parts, according to Air Force figures. Those payments\nbring the total value of the satellite contract to $2.4 billion,\naccording to the service figures.  Falls Church , Virginia-based  Northrop Grumman (NOC)  is the top\nsubcontractor on the program.  Bloomberg News  reported on Dec. 17\nthat the satellite contract was expected to be awarded this\nyear.
