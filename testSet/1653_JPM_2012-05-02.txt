 "context": "The following article called 'Merkel Is Cast as Thatcher\u2019s Austerity Goddess' was published on 2012-05-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThree decades ago, U.K. Prime Minister\n Margaret Thatcher  was confronted with a nation bordering on\nirrelevance, a stagnant economy and a set of entrenched beliefs\nabout the relationship between government and the people.  Thatcher faced down striking coal miners and forced through\na series of free-market reforms that unshackled Britain\u2019s\neconomy and made it vibrant once again. To the chorus of\naccusations that she was killing the economy, she replied:\n\u201cThere is no alternative.\u201d  She was right. Short-term pain -- in that case, a recession\nand a sharp spike in  unemployment  -- for long-term gain is\ngenerally a winning strategy.  We could use a dose of Lady Thatcher today. Instead, German\n Chancellor Angela Merkel  has been cast in the Iron Lady role,\ncharged with fending off policy prescriptions that run counter\nto her preferred fiscal discipline for the euro zone. In the\nlast week alone, Harvard\u2019s  Lawrence Summers , Princeton\u2019s  Paul\nKrugman , Columbia\u2019s  Joseph Stiglitz  and Berkeley\u2019s  Christina\nRomer  wrote  op-eds  claiming that austerity isn\u2019t working.\nInstead, the focus should be on growth.  That\u2019s a false dichotomy. Who wouldn\u2019t choose growth over\nausterity?  Europe\u2019s real choice isn\u2019t unlike the one faced by the\nU.S., according to  Jim Glassman , senior U.S. economist at\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. The choice is cyclical versus structural.  Bigger Fish  \u201cIt\u2019s all about recession,\u201d Glassman says. \u201cThe thinking\nis, when the economy comes back, everything will be fine.\nThere\u2019s a resistance to looking at fundamental structural\nproblems,\u201d which in Europe include an aging population, overly\ngenerous pensions, a rigid labor market and a large,\nunsustainable social safety net. \u201cThe more you push back on\nausterity, the less focus there is on structural problems,\u201d he\nsays.  And that\u2019s only part of the problem. Economists can\u2019t agree\nwhether  government spending  creates growth, creates the illusion\nof growth (government spending is a component of gross domestic\nproduct) or hampers growth because the private sector,\nanticipating a higher tax bill in the future, reacts adversely.  China \u2019s fiscal stimulus following the 2008 financial crisis\nwas touted as successful, though who can really tell with China?\nJapan, on the other hand, has little to show for decades of\npublic spending except oodles of debt: a debt-to-GDP ratio in\nexcess of 230 percent, the highest among industrialized nations.\nJapan is fortunate that its biggest creditor is the Japanese\npublic.  \u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear that government spending is\nexpansionary,\u201d says Robert Barro, a professor of economics at\n Harvard University . \u201cMoving toward fiscal discipline will have\na positive short-run effect.\u201d  Krugman pooh-poohs the idea that the private sector will\nstep up to the plate if government puts its house in order. He\nderisively compares this notion to a belief in the \u201c confidence\nfairy .\u201d  What should we call his premise that government spending is\nthe route to salvation? A confidence game? Why would taking\nmoney from one individual via borrowing or taxation and giving\nit to another have anything more than a transitory effect on the\neconomy? Even the government calls such finagling \u201ctransfer\npayments.\u201d  Answer: Because economists believe that a dollar of\ngovernment spending creates more than a dollar of GDP growth. It\ndoes because they say it does.  Another Broken Window  There are other econometric models, such as Barro\u2019s, that\nfind a multiplier of less than one. French political economist\nFrederic Bastiat explained how that could be 162 years ago in\nhis parable about the  broken window . We can see the dollar spent\nby the government; what\u2019s unseen is how the money would have\nbeen spent had the government not commandeered those resources.  And if this isn\u2019t enough to make you question the anti-\nausterity advice, consider that countries such as Spain, whose\ncredit rating was just downgraded two levels to BBB+ by  Standard\n& Poor\u2019s , might not be able to borrow the amounts necessary to\ncrank up growth (assuming you\u2019re in Krugman\u2019s camp). Last month,\nthe yield on Spain\u2019s  10-year bonds  surpassed 6 percent for the\nfirst time this year.  Even if Spain could borrow enough at increasingly higher\n interest rates , what happens if growth fails to materialize?\nAnother year older and deeper in debt.  If the euro zone is determined to spend money, its first\ntarget should be the banking system.  Europe \u2019s banks are\nundercapitalized and need to raise their capital-adequacy ratios\nto 9 percent by the end of June, according to  Carl Weinberg ,\nchief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New\nYork.  \u201cSave the banks, save the economy: Funding TARP was less\nbad than letting the U.S. banking system fail,\u201d Weinberg says,\nreferring to the U.S.\u2019s Troubled Asset Relief Program.  These are the same European banks that, courtesy of cheap\nthree-year loans from the  European Central Bank , have been the\nbiggest buyers of sovereign debt, preventing yields from rising\neven further.  Europeans, excluding Germans, have started to bridle at\nausterity, which is a surprise since most  austerity measures  are\nonly on paper. Last month, Socialist Francois Hollande edged out\nPresident  Nicolas Sarkozy  in the first round of France\u2019s general\nelection. One day later, the Dutch government, aligned with\n Germany  on the issue of austerity, collapsed over budgetary\ncuts.  With euro-zone  unemployment  tying a record high of 10.9\npercent in March, the voices urging budget discipline will\nprobably be drowned out by those who want to spend more now and\nignore the long-term, growth-retardant effect of accumulated\ngovernment debt.  Will Merkel capitulate? My bet is she stays in character\nand responds with something that would make  Lady Thatcher proud :\n\u201cThis Frau\u2019s not for turning.\u201d  ( Caroline Baum , author of \u201cJust What I Said,\u201d is a\nBloomberg View columnist.
