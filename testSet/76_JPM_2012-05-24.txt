 "context": "The following article called 'George Says Fed Directors Should Meet Standards or Resign' was published on 2012-05-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFederal Reserve  Bank of Kansas City\nPresident Esther George said that directors at the Fed\u2019s\nregional banks who don\u2019t meet the central bank\u2019s standards for\nimpartiality should step down.  \u201cBankers should serve,\u201d George said in a statement\nreleased today by the Kansas City Fed. \u201cThere are high\nstandards that apply to Reserve Bank directors, and when an\nindividual no longer meets these standards, the director resigns\nvoluntarily to allow someone who does meet the criteria to\nserve.\u201d  The directors at the 12 regional Fed banks are under\nrenewed scrutiny following a $2 billion trading loss at  JPMorgan\nChase & Co. (JPM)  that revived concern that its regulator, the  New\nYork  Fed, is too cozy with  Wall Street . JPMorgan Chief Executive\nOfficer Jamie Dimon is one of three bankers sitting on the board\nof the New York Fed.  Elizabeth Warren , a Democrat and U.S. Senate candidate from\nMassachusetts, has called for Dimon\u2019s resignation, while\nTreasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said last week that\nhaving bankers on the board of the New York Fed creates a\n\u201cperception\u201d problem. Senators  Bernie Sanders ,  Barbara Boxer \nand Mark Begich on May 22 introduced legislation that would\nremove banking industry executives from the regional Fed banks\u2019\nboards of directors.  \u201cThe Federal Reserve Banks -- to a bank -- love having\nbank directors on their boards,\u201d said William K. Black, a\nprofessor of economics and law at the University of Missouri at\n Kansas City  and a former bank regulator. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate to\nretain that system and the leading threat is Jamie Dimon who has\nbecome a poster child for the conflict.\u201d  Defense of Role  George defended the role of bankers on the Fed regional\nbank boards because they \u201cprovide critical, in-depth\ninformation about economic conditions in their communities.\u201d\nAlso, the bankers \u201cplay no part in the Fed\u2019s role in\nsupervising and regulating financial institutions.\u201d  Still, George said directors should step down if they don\u2019t\nmeet the standards of the Fed\u2019s Guide to Conduct for Directors\nof Federal Reserve Banks. Directors should avoid any action that\nmight \u201cresult in or create the appearance\u201d of harming \u201cthe\nconfidence of the public in the integrity\u201d of the Fed, the\nguide says, according to George\u2019s statement.  \u201cNo individual is more important than the institution and\nthe public\u2019s trust,\u201d George said. She didn\u2019t refer to any\ndirector by name and declined further comment through Bill Medley, a Kansas City Fed spokesman.  \u2018There\u2019s an Issue\u2019  \u201cIf you\u2019re going to put out a statement it\u2019s implicitly\nstating that there\u2019s an issue here,\u201d said  Sarah Binder , a\nsenior fellow at the  Brookings Institution  in Washington.  \u201cBut  Jamie Dimon  stepping down doesn\u2019t actually solve the\nproblem if there\u2019s a broader problem of having bankers on the\nboard,\u201d said Binder, who researches the relationship between\nthe Fed and Congress.  Dimon said on May 15 in Tampa, Florida, that the New York\nFed\u2019s board of directors is \u201cnot like a board, it\u2019s more of an\nadvisory group\u201d and \u201cI am not involved at all in the\nsupervisory side of that.\u201d  JPMorgan stock has fallen 17 percent since Dimon announced\nthe $2 billion loss on May 10, compared with a 3 percent loss\nfor the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  Bankers serve on Fed boards under terms established by\nCongress in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act. The regional banks\neach have nine directors, with three of them bankers. Three\nothers are appointed by banks to represent the public and the\nremaining three are selected by the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors in\nWashington.  \u2018Creature of Congress\u2019  \u201cThe Federal Reserve is a creature of Congress and they\u2019re\nfree to shape it any way they want,\u201d Minneapolis Fed President\n Narayana Kocherlakota  said in response to audience questions\nyesterday in Rapid City,  South Dakota .  \u201cAs a president, I get a lot of incredibly useful\ninformation from the bank directors that serve on our boards and\nI think it would be a loss to me in my policy role to lose that\nvaluable source of information,\u201d he said.  Congress most recently amended the role of directors with\nthe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act which ended the practice of banker\ndirectors having a vote in electing regional presidents, a move\nthe New York Fed\u2019s William C. Dudley said in a September\ninterview that he supported.  Yet some Senators now want to further separate the Fed\u2019s\nboards of directors from banking industry executives.  \u201cAllowing currently employed banking industry executives\nto serve as directors on the boards of directors of Federal\nReserve banks is a clear conflict of interest that must be\neliminated,\u201d according to the text of legislation released by\nSanders, a Vermont Independent who caucuses with Democrats. His\ncosponsors, both Democrats, are Alaska\u2019s Begich and  California \u2019s\nBoxer.
