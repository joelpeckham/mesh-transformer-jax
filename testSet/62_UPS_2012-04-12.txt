The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCritics of the U.S. Export-Import\nBank \u201cwant to unilaterally disarm\u201d American companies from\ncompeting in the global marketplace while countries including\n China  support their industries, the lender\u2019s chairman said.  Congress should renew the bank\u2019s charter for four years and\nincrease its lending authority to $140 billion from $100 billion\nto keep U.S. exporters competitive,  Fred Hochberg , the Ex-Im\nbank\u2019s chairman and president, said at a conference today in\nWashington.  \u201cOther countries will happily step in if we can\u2019t or won\u2019t\nfinance a deal,\u201d he said.  The 78-year-old bank is using the conference to press for a\nrenewal of its charter, which is set to expire May 31 and has\ndrawn opposition. Among those scheduled to speak at the event\nare former President Bill Clinton, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel\nand  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  Chief Executive Officer Scott Davis.  Critics of the bank, including the Club for Growth, which\nsupports smaller government, say the lender meddles in private\nenterprise. Supporters of reauthorization include the  National\nAssociation of Manufacturers  and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  Senate Republicans defeated a bipartisan measure on March\n20 to reauthorize the bank for four years and increase its\nlending limit to $140 billion as part of a bill rolling back\nSecurities and Exchange Commission rules.  Delta Lawsuit  Some U.S. airlines including  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  of\nAtlanta and  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  of Tempe, Arizona, in November\nsued the bank through a trade association, alleging that the\nlender \u201croutinely fails to evaluate the negative impact that\nits commitments have on domestic industries and domestic\nemployment.\u201d The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for\nthe District of Columbia.  The bank performs an economic-impact review of each of its\ntransactions, which include loan guarantees, insurance and\ndirect lending, Hochberg said in an interview April 4.  Boeing Co. (BA) , the world\u2019s biggest aerospace company, is one\nof the bank\u2019s main beneficiaries and a leading advocate for its\nreauthorization. Senator Jim DeMint, a South Carolina Republican\nand founder of the Senate Tea Party caucus, has said the bank\ngives foreign airlines an edge over American carriers, such as\nDelta, in buying new aircraft.  Unless Congress acts, \u201call new activity will grind to a\nhalt,\u201d Hochberg said. American companies \u201cwill find themselves\nat a huge disadvantage\u201d while China and other governments use\nexport finance to create jobs in their countries, he said.  Congress intends to take up the issue again when it returns\nfrom a two-week recess April 16.
