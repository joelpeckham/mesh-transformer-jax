 "context": "The following article called 'Rona Rejects C$14.50 Offer From U.S. Retailer Lowe\u2019s' was published on 2012-08-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRona Inc. (RON)  investors anticipate a\nbidding contest to keep the home-improvement retailer in  Quebec \nhands after it rejected an offer from Lowe\u2019s Cos. that sent the\nshares to a record one-day gain.  \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not averse to\u201d the Quebec government\nleading a counter offer, said  Irwin Michael , a  money manager  in\nToronto at IA Michael Investment Counsel, the third-biggest\nholder of Rona, with 3.65 million shares.  Three hours after Rona announced it had rebuffed Lowe\u2019s\nunsolicited cash bid of C$14.50 a share, Quebec Finance Minister\nRaymond Bachand said the province may take steps to prevent a\ntakeover by Lowe\u2019s. Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, a\nMontreal-based pension fund with a mandate to support Quebec\nbusinesses, and Rona\u2019s biggest shareholder, raised its stake\nyesterday to 14 percent from 12 percent.  Bachand asked the province\u2019s development corporation,\nInvestissement Quebec, to examine actions to counter Lowe\u2019s,\nwhich may include setting up a fund to \u201cdefend Quebec\u2019s\ninterests,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis transaction does not appear to be in the interests\nof either Quebec or Canada,\u201d he said in a statement.  Rona soared 22 percent to C$14.50 in Toronto yesterday,\nbefore falling back to close at C$13.50 after the Quebec\ngovernment announced its opposition to the proposed sale. The\none-day gain was the biggest on record. It closed up another 10\ncents today at C$13.60. Lowe\u2019s, which has already started\nacquiring shares of Rona, fell 5.6 percent in  New York  yesterday\nand closed 0.9 percent lower today at $25.14.  Strategic Asset  Bachand called Rona a \u201cstrategic asset\u201d for the country\nbecause of the 30,000 people it employs and its network of\nCanadian suppliers. He told reporters on a conference call that\nInvestissement Quebec could acquire a \u201csmall part\u201d of Rona and\nlead a coalition of other shareholders opposed to the deal.  The Caisse de Depot bought its additional shares at an\naverage price of C$14.17 to give it more leverage in the\ntakeover battle and to profit if Lowe\u2019s raises its bid, said\nSachin Shah, a merger arbitrage strategist at Tullett Prebon\nAmericas Corp.  \u201cThey\u2019re betting the valuation is much higher than C$14.50\nand they are also betting Lowe\u2019s does the things necessary to\nget to the finish line,\u201d he said by phone from  Jersey City .  Rona, which operates  Canada \u2019s largest network with almost\n800 of hardware and lumber stores, received the non-binding\nproposal on July 8 and the board rejected it unanimously,\naccording to a statement. The offer is 22 percent higher than\nRona\u2019s closing price the previous day and values the\nBoucherville, Quebec-based firm at about C$1.76 billion. Even\nwith yesterday\u2019s gain, Rona is down 50 percent from its 2005\nhigh.  Remain Focused  \u201cThe board believes that in the best interests of Rona and\nits stakeholders, the corporation should remain focused on\nexecuting its business plan with a view to capturing significant\nopportunities that it sees for its business,\u201d Rona said in the\nstatement.  Rona would be Lowe\u2019s biggest takeover, allowing the\nretailer to accelerate its expansion in Canada, where it has\nopened 31 stores since 2007 to compete with Rona, Canadian Tire\nCorp. and  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  of Atlanta.  \u201cOur interest is to do a friendly transaction and look for\na way to create a proposal that fits the needs of their\nstakeholders and ours,\u201d Doug Robinson, Lowe\u2019s head of\ninternational operations and development, said by telephone\ntoday from  Montreal .  Canadian Stores  Lowe\u2019s, based in Mooresville,  North Carolina , said in March\nit envisioned operating more than 100 stores in Canada, trailing\ncompetitor Home Depot, which has 180 stores in the country.  Robinson, 53, said Lowe\u2019s is making the case that the\ntransaction makes sense for both companies and is counting on\nRona investors to \u201cshare their views\u201d with Rona\u2019s board.\nLowe\u2019s said institutional  shareholders  representing 15 percent\nof Rona\u2019s outstanding shares have indicated support for the\nproposal, though Robinson declined to identify which investors.  The federal government in Canada has the power to block\ntakeovers under the Investment Canada Act unless they provide a\n\u201cnet benefit to the nation.\u201d In 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservative government blocked  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) \u2019s $40\nbillion bid for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  Canadian Industry Minister Christian Paradis said yesterday\nthere is no need for the federal government to review any bid\nfor Rona Inc. by Lowe\u2019s at this time.  \u201cI am aware that Lowe\u2019s has made a proposal that was\nrejected by Rona,\u201d Paradis said in the statement. \u201cThere is\ntherefore no investment to be reviewed under the Investment\nCanada Act at this time.\u201d  Not Surprising  Though Quebec would not have the power to directly block a\nbid for Rona, it can influence the federal government\u2019s review,\nas Saskatchewan did in the Potash case. Quebec Premier Jean Charest is also expected to call an election as early as this\nweek. The Globe and Mail reported the election call may come\ntoday.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprising reaction, if you look at the\nhistory of Quebec\u2019s position,\u201d said William Polushin, a\nprofessor of international business at  McGill University  in\nMontreal. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent with the idea that Quebec does try\nto identify wherever possible where it can support Quebec\nindustry and do it Quebec\u2019s way.\u201d  Lowe\u2019s Robinson said \u201cthe lines of communication are wide\nopen\u201d with the Quebec and Canadian governments, and they are\ninterested in \u201cfriendly negotiations.\u201d  Higher Bid  Robinson said the takeover bid involved combining its\nCanadian business with Rona\u2019s headquarters in Quebec, and\nmaintaining Rona\u2019s Canadian employment. He said those\nconcessions don\u2019t detract from the transaction because Lowe\u2019s is\nlooking to expand into Rona\u2019s home base of Quebec, where the\nU.S.-based retailer has no stores.  \u201cWe would not be surprised if Lowe\u2019s increased its bid to\naccelerate expansion in Canada,\u201d  Alan Rifkin, an analyst at\nBarclays Capital Inc., wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  \u201cThe management of Rona has been disinclined for awhile\nnow to accept this transaction,\u201d said Jonathan Brodsky, who\nhelps manage $9.5 billion at Advisory Research Inc., by phone\nfrom  Chicago . \u201cThe provincial government of Quebec has\nindicated that it\u2019s reviewing the transaction as well. So of\ncourse we\u2019re looking to a higher bid but we recognize there are\nissues to overcome.\u201d  Lowe\u2019s said the CEOs of the two companies first met on July\n27, 2011, at Rona\u2019s request. Lowe\u2019s made a proposal to acquire\nRona on Dec. 15, 2011 that was rejected by Rona\u2019s board.  Rona hired Scotiabank and BMO Capital Markets as financial\nadvisers and Norton Rose Canada LLP and Davies Ward Phillips &\nVinberg LLP as legal advisers. CIBC and Bank of America Merrill\nLynch are working with Lowe\u2019s.
