The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nM&T Bank Corp.  posted its biggest\none-day loss in 16 months in New York trading after reports that\nmerger talks with Banco Santander SA have broken down again.  The talks between M&T, based in Buffalo, New York, and\nSantander, based in the Spanish city of the same name, fell\napart late last week over a disagreement about who would control\nthe combination of Santander\u2019s Sovereign Bank unit and M&T, a\nperson with knowledge of the matter said.  M&T  fell  7 percent to $84.24 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock\nExchange composite trading, the biggest skid since May 13, 2009.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Sept. 25 that the talks had\nstalled.  Santander has been pursuing a merger of Sovereign with M&T,\nwhile negotiating for  Allied Irish Banks Plc \u2019s 22.5 percent\nstake in the lender, other people with knowledge of the matter\nhave said. Together, M&T and Sovereign, which are about the same\nsize, would become the ninth-largest U.S. savings institution by\ndeposits.  Talks between Santander and M&T, led by Chief Executive\nOfficer  Robert Wilmers , 76, stopped earlier this year and later\nrestarted. Under a proposal recently discussed with the U.S.\nFederal Reserve, Santander would eventually acquire a majority\nstake in M&T while leaving Wilmers and his management team with\nsome elements of control, the people said.  M&T Bank could be an attractive takeover target for\nPittsburgh-based  PNC Financial Services Group , according to an\nAugust report by  David Hendler , senior analyst at CreditSights\nInc., in New York.
