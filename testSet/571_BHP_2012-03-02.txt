About 1,500 residents have been told to prepare to\nevacuate, State Emergency Service Commissioner Murray Kear said\nat a press conference broadcast on  Sky News  today. Warragamba\nDam, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) west of the nation\u2019s biggest\ncity Sydney, is 98 percent  full  after heavy rain this week, the\nSydney Catchment Authority said on its website.  About 1,560 people have already been evacuated from the\ntowns of Cowra, Cooma and Goulburn, in the state\u2019s southeast,\ndue to flooding, the SES said. Parts of Bega, a town of about\n4,500 people 400 kilometers south of Sydney, were  evacuated  last\nnight, it said. Floodwaters in northern New South Wales last\nmonth damaged homes, ruined cotton crops and caused cattle sales\nto be canceled, one year after natural disasters cost the\nAustralian economy A$9 billion ($9.7 billion).  \u201cWe\u2019re expecting major  flooding  on a number of rivers as\nwe go into the weekend,\u201d Julie Evans, a meteorologist at the\nBureau of Meteorology, said by telephone today.

The dam\u2019s catchment area may receive another\n50 millimeters (2 inches) of  rain  in the next three days, Evans\nsaid from Sydney.
