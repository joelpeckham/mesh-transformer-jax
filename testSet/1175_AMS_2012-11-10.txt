The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAnglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  workers\nrejected a one-time payment to end an unofficial eight-week\nstrike in South Africa that has halted production of about a\nfifth of global platinum output.  Management proposed a payment of 4,500 rand ($517),\ncomprising 2,000 rand for employees who didn\u2019t strike or who\nhave \u201cfinancial difficulties,\u201d and 2,500 rand to be paid two\nweeks after work resumes notwithstanding further incidents. The\noffer, which will cost the world\u2019s largest platinum producer 220\nmillion rand, was contingent on employees returning by Nov. 12,\nJohannesburg-based company known as Amplats said yesterday.  \u201cThe strike is carrying on,\u201d Evans Ramokga, a worker\nrepresentative, said by phone from Rustenburg, northwest of\nJohannesburg, where the strikers staged a peaceful rally today.\n\u201cWe want salary increases. How can the company talk about going\nback to work without workers\u2019 demands being adhered to?\u201d  Amplats, which fired 12,000 workers at its Rustenburg\noperations on Oct. 5, has said the demand of workers for a\nsalary increase of 4,500 rand a month would cost about 2.6\nbillion rand and is unaffordable. Management reopened\ndiscussions with unions and representatives on Nov. 7 after\npreviously offering a one-time payment of 2,000 rand if workers\nreturned by Oct. 30 and promising to reinstate the 12,000.  Mpumi Sithole, a spokeswoman for Amplats, and Lesiba\nSeshoka, a spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers, both\nsaid they were unaware of the workers\u2019 decision and couldn\u2019t\ncomment.
