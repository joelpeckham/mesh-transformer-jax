 "context": "The following article called 'Amazon Acquires Kiva Systems in Second-Biggest Takeover' was published on 2012-03-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  is making its\nbiggest acquisition since the 2009 purchase of Zappos.com,\nagreeing to pay $775 million for Kiva Systems Inc., a maker of\nrobots that move items around warehouses.  The all-cash deal for closely held Kiva will close in the\nsecond quarter, Seattle-based Amazon said today in a statement.\nKiva\u2019s orange robots, which can slide under shelves and bins of\nproducts, are used by Quidsi Inc. -- the company behind Soap.com\nand Diapers.com that Amazon acquired for about  $545 million  last\nyear.  The takeover of Kiva by the world\u2019s largest online retailer\nwill add to investments Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Bezos  has\nmade in the company\u2019s order-fulfillment centers, as Amazon seeks\nto get a bigger variety of products to consumers faster. Amazon\nspent $4.6 billion last year on warehouses -- the company\u2019s\nlargest operating expense at 9.5 percent of sales, according to\nits annual report.  \u201cIt\u2019s an internal infrastructure play, and it comes at a\ntime when their headcount has been growing faster than\nrevenue,\u201d  Colin Gillis , an analyst at BGC Partners LP in  New\nYork , said in an interview. \u201cOne of the knocks on Amazon is\nthat their fulfillment is an expensive, manual process. They\u2019re\nnot getting the benefits of scale. So they\u2019re taking some steps\ntowards it.\u201d  Employees, Revenue Rise  Amazon had 56,200 full-time and part-time employees in\n2011, a 67 percent increase from the year before, while revenue\nrose 41 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The company\u2019s stock rose 47 cents, or less than 1 percent,\nto $185.52 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 7.2\npercent in this year.  The online retailer is under pressure to increase its\nshipping capacity as more third-party retailers use its\nfulfillment services, taking advantage of the company\u2019s\nwarehouses and lower shipping rates. Units sold by outside\nvendors increased 65 percent in the fourth quarter from a year\nearlier, and made up 36 percent of unit sales.  Kiva, whose headquarters will remain in North Reading,\n Massachusetts , will help Amazon make shipping more efficient,\nthe company said.  \u201cAmazon has long used automation in its fulfillment\ncenters, and Kiva\u2019s technology is another way to improve\nproductivity by bringing the products directly to employees to\npick, pack and stow,\u201d Dave Clark, vice president of global\ncustomer fulfillment at Amazon, said in the statement.  Margin Pressure  Amazon\u2019s  operating margin  is predicted to narrow to 1.6\npercent in 2012 after falling 2.3 percentage points last year,\nputting stress on the company to bolster profits. In January,\nChief Financial Officer Thomas Szkutak said operating results\nthis quarter will range from a loss of $200 million to a gain of\n$100 million.  Amazon spent about $1.2 billion to buy online shoe retailer\nZappos.com in 2009, its biggest acquisition. The company often\nopts for licensing agreements, like the ones it made in the past\ntwo months with Viacom Inc. and  Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA)  to\ndistribute streaming online video content.  The company had made four takeovers in the past year before\ntoday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It also acquired a 31\npercent stake in LivingSocial.com, the No. 2 daily-deal site\nbehind Groupon Inc., according to a regulatory filing.  \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting move that they\u2019re not just licensing\nit,\u201d Gillis said. \u201cIt potentially removes the advantage for\nany competitor.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDanielle Kucera in  San Francisco  at \n dkucera6@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTom Giles at \n tgiles5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Discovery Communications, Inc. - Series A was 24.49156951904297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Discovery Communications, Inc. - Series A was ",
