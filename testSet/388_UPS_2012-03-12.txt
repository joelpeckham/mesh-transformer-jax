 "context": "The following article called 'Obama Hits Factories as He Paints Romney as Wall Street' was published on 2012-03-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPresident  Barack Obama  wants voters\nto know that not all chief executive officers are created equal.\nSome excel at manufacturing jobs, while others succeed in making\nmoney.  In the battle to be the nation\u2019s CEO-in-chief, Obama is\nbuilding the argument that the  U.S. economy  would suffer with\nthe latter, someone from the private equity world where  Mitt Romney , his chief potential challenger and Bain Capital LLC co-\nfounder, hails.  \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to an economy that was weakened by\noutsourcing and bad debts and phony financial profits,\u201d Obama\nsaid March 9 at Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc\u2019s Crosspointe advanced\nmanufacturing facility in Prince George, Virginia. \u201cWe\u2019ve got\nto have an economy that\u2019s built to last, and that begins with\nmanufacturing.\u201d  Obama has recently appeared alongside some of the nation\u2019s\nmost prominent business leaders, including Rolls-Royce North\nAmerica CEO James Guyette and  Boeing Co. (BA)  CEO  James McNerney ,\nshaking hands on factory floors and inspecting industrial\nequipment. He\u2019s promoting policy initiatives focused on boosting\nthe American worker with  manufacturing  incentives, skills\ntraining and community college partnerships.  Business Model Preference  In doing so, the president is aligning himself with a\ncertain kind of business model, while undercutting the private-\nsector experience of Romney, who stakes his economic bona fides\non his financial management background.  \u201cAmerica sells itself based on industry, that\u2019s what made\npeople profitable, that\u2019s what got people into the middle\nclass,\u201d said Shari Anne Brill, a media strategist who owns her\nown consulting firm. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of story that appeals to\npeople versus the people who are in the business of wheeling-\nand-dealing and increasing wealth.\u201d  Andrea Saul, Romney\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, said the\npresident\u2019s message is evidence that he\u2019s \u201cscared at the\nprospect\u201d of facing Romney in the general election.  \u201cThe last thing President Obama wants to do is run against\na conservative businessman who has worked in the real economy\nand have to explain why his policies have been unable to get\nmillions of Americans back to work,\u201d she said.  Obama hasn\u2019t drawn the contrast in such direct terms and\nRomney has yet to secure the  Republican Party \u2019s nomination. And\nthe effort to distinguish between the two types of business\nmodels may also be borne from Obama\u2019s lack of management\nexperience and tense relationship with the business community.  Wall Street Distrust  Still, the president\u2019s aides see the former Massachusetts\ngovernor as the likely nominee and are tapping into the public\u2019s\ndistaste for  Wall Street . A December Pew Research Center  poll \nfound that 51 percent of respondents said Wall Street hurts the\nU.S. economy more than it helps. Sixty-one percent of those\npolled said the economic system \u201cunfairly favors the wealthy.\u201d  In a Jan. 13 memo,  Stephanie Cutter , Obama\u2019s deputy\ncampaign director, highlighted comments by a former managing\npartner at Bain, Mark Walpow, who said: \u201cThe primary goal of\nprivate equity is to create wealth for your investors.\u201d  \u201cVoters need to understand the kind of economy Mitt\nRomney\u2019s experience entails - and it doesn\u2019t sound like the kind\nof economy that\u2019s built to last,\u201d Cutter wrote.  Obama\u2019s \u201cAmerica Built to Last\u201d slogan tries to channel\nthe business model of a CEO at a company like Boeing,  Ford Motor\nCo. (F) , or  General Electric Co. (GE)  that exports goods and services\naround the world and needs to make sure it\u2019s equipped for the\nfuture with a long-term growth strategy.  Obama\u2019s Credibility Gap  Whether voters will hold Romney accountable to the negative\naspects of private equity is yet to be determined. And Obama has\na credibility gap to overcome, not just with business, but with\nthe broader public, said Steven Reinemund, dean of Wake Forest\nUniversity\u2019s Schools of Business.  \u201cSo much criticism has been laid at the feet of business\nthat it\u2019s hard at this point for the president to delineate\nbetween these two models that he\u2019s trying to create,\u201d said\nReinemund, a former PepsiCo CEO.  As Romney touts his own business experience, the\npresident\u2019s campaign will point out the distinction between\nObama\u2019s emphasis on investing in America\u2019s workers with examples\nof workers being fired during Romney\u2019s time at Bain.  While Romney tells campaign audiences he helped create a\nnet of 100,000 jobs during his years at Bain, a Bloomberg News\nreview of several Bain transactions during Romney\u2019s tenure found\ndeals that resulted in hundreds of job cuts along with companies\nfiling for bankruptcy or facing lawsuits from shareholders who\nsaid they were misled by management.  Romney Record  Romney touts his record of creating retail jobs at\ncompanies including  Staples Inc. (SPLS)  and The Sports Authority Inc.,\nyet retail sales positions are among the fastest-growing and\nlowest-paid jobs in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics.  The average compensation, including benefits,\nacross all retail jobs, from chief executive officer to clerk,\nis $17.15 an hour, the bureau says, compared with $32.95 an hour\nfor manufacturing.  \u201cI want us to make stuff. I want us to sell stuff,\u201d Obama\nsaid last month at Boeing\u2019s Everett, Washington jet factory\nafter he toured the 787 Dreamliner assembly floor with McNerney.  Obama has taken his message to a  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) \nfacility in  Las Vegas  with the company\u2019s CEO Scott Davis in\nJanuary, a stop at a Master Lock Co. factory in  Milwaukee  last\nmonth and last week in a visit to a Daimler Trucks North America\nPlant in Mount Holly,  North Carolina .  \u2018Suits and Ties\u2019  \u201cYou want to communicate that \u2018Hey, I\u2019m standing with the\npeople in America who are working, who by the dint of their\nlabors, the sweat of their brow built this country and are\nbuilding our future,\u201d said  John Engler , president of the\n Business Roundtable  and a former Republican governor of\n Michigan . \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be with people in suits and\nties.\u201d  A challenge for Obama will be streamlining the mixed\nmessages he\u2019s sent about business.  \u201cThis is after two years of making all CEOs pariahs and\nspurning them -- It\u2019s not so easy,\u201d said Bill George, a\nprofessor of management practices at  Harvard Business School  in\nCambridge,  Massachusetts . \u201cThis is not about leadership, this\nis about politics.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJulianna Goldman in Washington at \n jgoldman6@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSteve Komarow at   skomarow1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of United Parcel Service, Inc. was 57.923377990722656 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of United Parcel Service, Inc. was ",
