 "context": "The following article called 'Santos Prices 300 Million Euro Follow-On Hybrid Bonds for Gas Projects' was published on 2010-10-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSantos Ltd. , Australia\u2019s third-\nlargest oil and gas producer, priced an additional 300 million\neuros ($421 million) of hybrid notes to help fund its Gladstone\nliquefied natural gas project.  The bonds, following last month\u2019s sale of 700 million euros\nof hybrid securities, were issued at an implied yield of about\n8.05 percent, according to an e-mailed statement from UBS AG,\nwhich helped manage the sale with Deutsche Bank AG. The notes\npriced 20 basis points tighter than the earlier bonds, UBS said.  \u201cThe success of the deal was underpinned by the hybrid\u2019s\nstrong secondary trading performance over the last three\nweeks,\u201d  Barry Sharkey , director of hybrid capital markets at\nUBS in Sydney, said in the statement.  The Gladstone project in Queensland state is among A$200\nbillion ($198 billion) of proposed LNG ventures in Australia\ntargeting Asian demand for cleaner-burning alternatives to coal,\naccording to figures last month from the Australian Petroleum\nProduction & Exploration Association. The development, with two\nproduction units, may cost A$16.4 billion according to Deutsche\nBank, and  Santos  aims to commit to the first stage of the\nproject by the end of this year.  The 1 billion euros of notes, rated BB by Standard &\nPoor\u2019s, are due in September 2070 and pay a coupon of 8.25\npercent for the first seven years, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. The hybrids, which blend characteristics of debt and\nequity, will cut the amount of shares the company may have to\nsell in the future to fund the gas venture while maintaining its\nBBB+  rating , Santos said in a regulatory filing today.  Secondary Market  The bonds rose 0.88 cents to close at 102.8 cents on the\neuro yesterday, yielding 7.715 percent, according to Frankfurt\nExchange prices on Bloomberg.  Santos shares rose 0.6 percent to A$12.91 on the Australian\nstock exchange at the 4:10 p.m. market close today, compared\nwith a 0.2 percent decline for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.\nThe Adelaide-based company\u2019s stock climbed as much as 1.3\npercent today.  \u201cGiven the strong support received for our initial hybrid\nissue in September, we received significant demand from\ninvestors for a follow-on issue,\u201d Santos Chief Financial\nOfficer  Peter Wasow  said in the company\u2019s statement.  The additional notes received 620 million euros worth of\nbids from more than 60 investors, according to UBS.  The bonds may be redeemed by Santos after 7 years and will\notherwise convert to floating-rate notes that pay a coupon of\n6.851 percentage points more than the three month euro area\ninterbank offered rate, or Euribor, Bloomberg data show.
