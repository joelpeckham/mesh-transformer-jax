The Aussie gained versus most of its 16 major counterparts\nthis week as U.S. President  Barack Obama  and Republican\nlawmakers continued discussions on increasing the nation\u2019s debt\nlimit and ending a partial government shutdown. The kiwi dollar\nrebounded as Asian stocks headed for their biggest one-day gain\nin three weeks and before a report that may show New Zealand\u2019s\ninflation accelerated to a 1 1/2-year high.  \u201cThe momentum has picked up and a lot of the fears have\nwaned over Chinese growth,\u201d said  Sean Callow , a senior currency\nstrategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. \u201cThere\u2019s no\ndoubt that\u2019s been one of the reasons the Aussie dollar has been\nmore resilient than in the past.\u201d  The Australian dollar gained 0.2 percent to 94.70 U.S.\ncents as of 4:40 p.m. in Sydney after earlier touching 94.85,\nthe strongest since Sept. 19. It has risen 0.4 percent since\nOct. 4. New Zealand\u2019s currency climbed 0.3 percent to 83.08 U.S.\ncents after falling 0.3 percent yesterday. It\u2019s weakened 0.1\npercent this week.

The yield on the the South Pacific nation\u2019s three-year debt\ndeclined two basis points to 3.10 percent.  Chinese  imports  probably rose 7 percent in September from a\nyear earlier after increasing by the same amount the previous\nmonth, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed\nby  Bloomberg News  before tomorrow\u2019s report. Exports climbed 5.5\npercent after a 7.2 percent advance in August, analysts\nprojected.  Best Performer  Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes show the Aussie was\nthe best performer in the past week, rising 0.9 percent against\na basket of nine other developed-nation currencies tracked by\nthe gauges. The kiwi gained 0.4 percent.  In the U.S., Obama didn\u2019t accept or reject House\nRepublicans\u2019 plan to increase the debt limit as the two sides\npledged to continue talks. The government of the world\u2019s biggest\neconomy will run out of borrowing authority on Oct. 17.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares climbed 1.1 percent,\npoised for the largest advance since Sept. 19.  New Zealand \u2019s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to\nreceive floating rates, rose one basis point to 3.52 percent,\nset for a closing level unseen since Sept. 17.
