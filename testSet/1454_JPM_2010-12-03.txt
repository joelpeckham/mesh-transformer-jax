 "context": "The following article called 'China Bullet Trains Double Rail Stocks as Boom Brings Most Tracks in World' was published on 2010-12-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nZhu Yi used to nap on the five-hour\ntrain ride home to  Wuhan  from Zhuzhou in central China. Now that\na fast rail line has cut the trip to an hour and 40 minutes, he\ncan spend more time selling information-management systems.  Before, \u201cit took three days to get a project done,\u201d said\nZhu, 31, a sales manager for  Beijing Lanxum New Technology Co. \nin Wuhan. \u201cNow it\u2019s so fast I can work out a solution for the\nclient and be back home on the same day.\u201d  The view from Zhu\u2019s reclining seat shows how China\u2019s push to\nbuild a 16,000-kilometer high-speed passenger network by 2020 is\ncarrying China\u2019s industrial boom inland. All along the trackside\nare earth movers and excavators clearing land and beginning\nconstruction. They merge into a blur as the express accelerates\nto 350 kilometers (218 miles) an hour.  The country\u2019s planned 2 trillion yuan ($300 billion) in\nspending will give it almost as much track by 2012 as the entire\nrest of the world, even before the  network  is completed.  The new trains will transform China\u2019s economy in the way\nbullet trains did in Japan in the 1960s and 1970s, according to\nBeijing-based China International Capital Corp., the top-ranked\nbrokerage for China research in Asiamoney magazine\u2019s annual\nsurvey.  \u201cChina\u2019s high-speed rail program is altering the landscape\nof consumer and property markets,\u201d said  Jing Ulrich , JPMorgan\nChase & Co.\u2019s China equities and commodities head in Hong Kong.  Rail Shares  China\u2019s bullet-train spending has buoyed rail stocks since\na 4-trillion-yuan stimulus was announced in November 2008.\nShares of Dalian-based China Railway Tielong Container Logistics\nCo., which provides railroad, truck and water transportation\nservices, have risen 2.5 times since then.  China Railway Erju\nCo.  in Chengdu, which designs and builds railways, has more than\ndoubled.  Companies providing rolling stock and equipment to train\noperators have some of the best growth prospects in the country,\nsaid  Anderson Chow , a Hong Kong-based analyst with Macquarie\nCapital Securities. Overall investment in China\u2019s railway\nindustry will total 3.8 trillion yuan from 2011 to 2015, about\n50 percent more than in the last five years, he estimates.  Earnings growth at CSR Corp., which makes locomotives and\nwagons, will surge an annual average 38 percent over the next\nthree years, said Chow. At  Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric Co . in\nZhuzhou, which makes electrical systems for railways, earnings\nwill rise an average of about 35 percent annually over the same\nperiod, he said.  Earnings Certainty?  \u201cIf you look around the China market there are very few\ncompanies that give you that sort of certainty for earnings\ngrowth,\u201d Chow said.  The nation\u2019s $90 billion in spending on the network last\nyear far exceeds the $8 billion that President  Barack Obama \nallocated in stimulus for U.S. fast trains earlier this year.  The difference \u201cis a confirmation of China\u2019s rise and an\nindication of U.S. demise,\u201d said  Nicholas Lardy , a senior\nfellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in\nWashington. \u201cWe in the U.S. are doing little to nothing and\nwill pay a price in slower growth now and in the future.\u201d  Japan\u2019s bullet trains triggered \u201cexplosive growth\u201d in\ntourism-related retail sales along their routes in the decade\nafter Shinkansen services began in 1964, CICC said. Less-\ndeveloped cities such as Hiroshima, Nagoya and Fukuoka \u201cstarted\nto play catch-up in industrial production growth.\u201d Morgan\nStanley is selling its 34.3 percent stake in CICC, four people\nwith direct knowledge of the deal said.  Fewer Bottlenecks  In China, more businesses will move inland to capitalize on\nlabor as much as 50 percent cheaper than in the more affluent\neastern areas of the country, and on lower land and rental\ncosts. Increased rail capacity also will reduce freight\nbottlenecks, the bank said.  Beijing Lanxum\u2019s Zhu said the bullet trains helped him\nincrease sales about 15 percent this year in Zhuzhou, Hunan\u2019s\nsecond-biggest city, because he can contact more clients.  Changsha , population 6 million and the capital of Hunan\nprovince, shows how the fast trains are altering the landscape\nin central China. He Chuan Road features an array of dusty shops\nselling tires, noodles and groceries, typical of many provincial\ncities. Just around the corner towers the 200,000-square meter\nChangsha South Railway Station, its glass curtain walls capped\nby a 38-meter-high waved roof.  The coming of the trains prompted CITIC Capital\u2019s  Stanley Ching  to bet 1.5 billion yuan on CITIC\u2019s purchase of the ID Mall\nshopping complex in the city center, about 30 minutes from the\nstation. He plans to add a chain of branded retail malls over\nthe next three to five years, mostly in second- and third-tier\ncities along the high-speed rail routes.  \u2018Big Push\u2019  \u201cChangsha\u2019s been a very promising city but it needed a big\npush to turn it into a regional hub,\u201d said Ching, Hong Kong-\nbased head of real estate at CITIC Capital, which manages more\nthan $3 billion in private equity, in a telephone interview.\n\u201cHigh-speed rail is that big push.\u201d  China\u2019s industrial transformation may be greater than\nJapan\u2019s because its rail network will be bigger and its trains\nfaster, according to JP Morgan\u2019s Ulrich. A Chinese high-speed\ntrain today reached 486.1 kilometers per hour in what state-run\nXinhua News said was a world record for an unmodified commercial\nlocomotive. A specially equipped French TGV set a world record\nof 574.8 kilometers per hour in April 2007.  \u201cPlaces west of Shanghai can become part of China\u2019s giant\neast coast export zone, and that\u2019s already starting to happen,\u201d\nsaid  Arthur Kroeber , managing director of Beijing-based\nDragonomics, an economic advisory firm whose clients include\nFortune 500 companies and hedge funds.  All Capitals  China has more than 7,000 kilometers of high-speed track so\nfar. By 2012, Beijing plans to have 42 lines in operation,\ncovering 13,000 kilometers. Within a decade all provincial\ncapitals and cities with more than 500,000 citizens will have\nhigh-speed links, the Ministry of Railways says. Already, the\nChinese rail system is larger than any other country\u2019s,\naccording to the Paris-based  International Union of Railways .  Changsha\u2019s fast rail link enables CITIC Capital to hire\nsenior staff from coastal cities such as  Shenzhen  to manage the\nretail malls, said Ching.  When the Guangzhou-Shenzhen line opens next year, travel\ntime to Changsha will shrink to about 2.5 hours from more than 9\nhours. Another line, scheduled for completion in 2014, will cut\ntravel time between Guangzhou and Yunfu, a city of 2.6 million\nin Guangdong province, to 40 minutes from more than 2 hours.  Tableware Sales  Companies based in  Yunfu , such as stainless-steel tableware\nmaker Linkfair Group and agricultural company Wen\u2019s Group, will\nbenefit, said John Scales, Beijing-based transport sector\ncoordinator at the World Bank. The link will help them recruit\ndesigners and research staff, according to a World Bank case\nstudy on the city to be published next year, said Scales.  China\u2019s development of locomotives has won its companies\noverseas orders in Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and\nthe nation is competing to build a high-speed railway in\nCalifornia costing more than $40 billion.  Beijing-based  CSR Corp. , China\u2019s largest maker of rail\nvehicles, plans to partner with Fairfield, Connecticut-based\n General Electric Co.  on bids for U.S. high-speed train\ncontracts, CSR Chairman  Zhao Xiaogang  told reporters in Hong\nKong today. The companies may compete for lines in California,\nFlorida and elsewhere on the east coast, Zhao said.  In Brazil, Beijing-based  China Railway Construction Corp. \nand China CNR are leading a group bidding for a line that may\ncost as much as 33.1 billion reais ($19.2 billion).  Falling Shares  The overseas expansion has brought new risks to the\nsector\u2019s stocks. Shares of China Railway Construction, builder\nof more than half the nation\u2019s railroads, fell the most in\nalmost two years Oct. 26 after it predicted a 4.15-billion yuan\nloss from a Mecca, Saudi Arabia rail project.  Credit Suisse Group AG that day lowered its stock rating on\nthe company to \u201cunderperform\u201d from \u201coutperform.\u201d China\nRailway Construction reported a 1.36 billion yuan loss for the\nthree months ended September on Oct. 28, compared with a 1.45-\nbillion yuan profit a year earlier.  Critics in China, including professors at Peking University\nand  Beijing Jiaotong University , say the network\u2019s high cost\nmakes it financially unviable in a country where the average\nurban worker made 32,244 yuan last year, less than one-eighth of\nthe $39,054 average  wage  in the U.S., according to data from the\nU.S. and  Chinese  governments.  Peking University finance professor  Michael Pettis  called\nthe network a \u201ctrophy.\u201d  Zhao Jian , a professor of economics at\nBeijing Jiaotong University, said in a commentary in the China\nDaily newspaper in April that the \u201cblind pursuit\u201d of high-\nspeed rail is \u201chighly likely to develop into a debt crisis.\u201d  U.S. Rail Bonds  Railroads played a role in the collapse of the U.S.\ncorporate bond market in the late 1800s. The market had grown in\nprominence on Wall Street as railroad barons looked to raise\ncash to expand into the American West. Then came a flood of\ndefaults, which prompted lenders to start demanding certain\nprotections, known as covenants, written into bond contracts.  The 1870s proved to be \u201ca disastrous decade\u201d as default\nrates reached 35 percent, according to a Stanford University\nresearch  paper .  Russell Hoss , manager of the Newport Beach, California-\nbased EPH China Fund, said investors in China may do better\nbuying companies with businesses along the new lines.  \u201cThe best way to play high-speed rail is via branded\nconsumer companies expanding in inland cities that are being\nlinked to the east coast by the new tracks,\u201d he said, declining\nto name companies.  Sixfold Increase  The $90 million fund\u2019s only rail-linked investment is\nNanjing-based  China High Speed Transmission Equipment Group Co. ,\nwhich raised first-half revenue from its rail power business\nmore than sixfold to 15 billion yuan.  Kroeber said construction of new track for the network will\nfree up space on existing lines for freight, generating enough\nrevenue over 15 years to pay for the new lines. China\u2019s rail\nnetwork is \u201cbursting at the seams,\u201d he said.  Freight has doubled between Guangzhou and Wuhan since the\nroute opened in December, said He Huawu, the railway ministry\u2019s\nchief engineer, in an interview. The separation of passenger and\ncargo lines will release seven times the capacity for container\ntransportation, according to Shanghai-based Shenyin & Wanguo\nSecurities Co.  Singapore-based DBS Asset Management, which in April set up\nthe China Rail Network Opportunities Fund, sees a long-term\nexpansion.  Comfort Level  \u201cCompanies in this space are going to see a high level of\ngrowth over a sustained period,\u201d said Singapore-based fund\nmanager  Chan Kum Kong , who helps DBS Asset Management oversee\nS$25.6 billion ($19.3 billion). \u201cIn an environment where there\nis a lot of uncertainty, we thought this provided a high level\nof comfort.\u201d  The fund includes shares in such companies as Fuzhou-based\ndepartment store Fujian Dongbai (Group) Co., Ltd., which Chan\nexpects to record earnings growth of more than 40 percent over\nthe next two to three years, in part driven by greater mobility\nof labor spurred by high-speed rail links, he said.  New York-based Echo Lake Capital owns stock in concrete\nmaker  China Advanced Construction Materials Group Inc.  because\nit\u2019s poised to \u201cbenefit significantly from China\u2019s high-speed\nrail construction and infrastructure build-out,\u201d said fund\nmanager  Ephraim Fields  in e-mailed answers to questions.  The Nasdaq-listed  company , which supplies more than 50\npercent of its concrete to high-speed rail, is also beginning to\nbenefit from development in cities joined by the new lines, said\nBeijing-based Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Han Xianfu  in\nan interview. It expects to pour 1.5 million cubic meters of\nconcrete for a township near Wuhan spurred by the Guangzhou-\nWuhan-Zhengzhou line, said Han.  \u201cNow, business is driven mainly by the supply of concrete\nfor the high-speed rail network,\u201d said Han. \u201cIn 10 years, the\nstory will be about how we capitalized on urbanization projects\ncreated by that network.\u201d  -- Kevin Hamlin .
