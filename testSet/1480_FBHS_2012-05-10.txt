 "context": "The following article called 'Rise in Residential Investment May Help Home Depot-Lowe\u2019s' was published on 2012-05-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSpending on construction of new\nresidential housing and improvements to existing homes is at a\nthree-year high, a trend that may boost sales at  Home Depot Inc. (HD) \nand  Lowe\u2019s Cos. (LOW)   Private-residential fixed investment, which includes major\nreplacements such as new roofs and improvements like finishing a\nbasement, rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier to an annualized\n$360.7 billion for the three months ended March 31. This marks\nthe fourth consecutive quarter of nominal increases and was the\nfastest pace of yearly growth since 2006, Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis data show.  These expenditures may prolong a structure\u2019s life or\nincrease its value and are \u201canother piece of corroborating\nevidence\u201d that home-related purchases were \u201cvery good\u201d in the\nfirst quarter, said Scot Ciccarelli, a New York-based analyst at\n RBC Capital Markets .  New U.S. homes sold at a  328,000 annual rate  in March,\nbeating the 319,000 median estimate of economists surveyed by\nBloomberg News. The total was down from an upwardly revised\n353,000 pace the prior month that was the highest in two years,\nbased on Commerce Department data.  Residential building permits also climbed unexpectedly by\n4.5 percent to a 747,000 annual rate in March,  the highest  since\nSeptember 2008. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a\n710,000 pace.  High Correlation  Private-residential spending -- which accounts for about\n2.3 percent of gross domestic product -- is highly correlated\nwith comparable-store sales for Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, the two\nlargest U.S. home-improvement retailers, Ciccarelli said.  Same-store sales probably rose at least 5 percent in the\nfiscal first quarter at Home Depot and at least 2.4 percent at\nLowe\u2019s from a year earlier, he forecasts. Atlanta-based Home\nDepot is scheduled to release earnings on May 15, followed on\nMay 21 by Lowe\u2019s, based in Mooresville,  North Carolina .  Home Depot reported an increase at stores opened at least a\nyear of 5.7 percent for the three months ended Jan. 29; Lowe\u2019s\nsaid sales rose 3.4 percent for the three months ended Feb. 3.  About 30 percent of  Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc. (FBHS) \u2019s\nNorth American sales are at Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s and home-\nimprovement chain Menard Inc., Chief Executive Officer\nChristopher Klein said in a telephone interview. The Deerfield,\nIllinois-based company, which owns the Moen faucet and Omega\ncabinet brands, is projecting a 4 percent increase in 2012\nrevenue for its repair and remodel business, up from a previous\nestimate of 2 percent, he said.  Signs of Comeback  As the housing industry shows signs of a comeback, the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Home Improvement Retail Index, comprised\nof Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, has risen 73 percent since Aug. 10,\n2011, compared with the  S&P 500 \u2019s 21 percent gain.  Shares of the two companies have outpaced the market in the\npast nine months as investors try to gauge how much recent\nrevenue increases reflect \u201cstronger forward-looking demand\u201d\nand not moderate weather, said Ciccarelli, who maintains\n\u201coutperform\u201d recommendations on these retailers.  Their valuations already may reflect improvement in\nhousing, Ciccarelli said. Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s are trading at\nmultiples of about 18.1 and 17.2 times consensus 2012 earnings,\ncompared with a five-year average of 15.9 and 15.5, he said.  \u201cIt\u2019s really become a duration call,\u201d he said.\n\u201cInvestors who think we\u2019ll get a multiyear recovery in the\nhousing market, particularly in home improvement, need to have\nexposure to these stocks.\u201d  Warm Weather  The warmer-than-usual winter may have contributed to as\nmuch as half of the 19 percent first-quarter sequential gain in\nprivate-residential fixed investment on an annualized basis,\naccording to estimates by Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist\nin  New York  at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.  \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see very faint signs of a housing\nrecovery, and a better labor market should further increase\ndemand for housing and related remodeling activity,\u201d he said.  The U.S. added 115,000 jobs in April, the 19th consecutive\nmonth of increases, while unemployment fell to 8.1 percent from\n8.2 percent in March, the Labor Department reported May 4.  The  National Association of Home Builders /Wells Fargo\nHousing Market Index, a gauge of builder perceptions for single-\nfamily home sales and forecasts for the next six months, held at\nan almost five-year high of 28 in March, then fell to 25 last\nmonth. Readings below 50 mean more respondents said conditions\nwere poor.  Real-Estate Activity  The  Federal Reserve  noted progress in its April 11 Beige\nBook: Residential real estate improved in \u201cmost districts,\u201d\nwith contacts in  Boston , Philadelphia and  Kansas City  saying\nmild weather boosted activity.  The higher-than-normal temperatures in January and February\nprobably helped spur outdoor projects in the Midwest and\nNortheast, as Fortune Brands saw increased demand in these\nregions, Klein said. Still, the \u201cpositive momentum is\nwidespread,\u201d with sales up in the Western and Southern states.\nThis suggests that even if demand for projects began earlier in\nthe season, \u201cit was more than just weather,\u201d he said.  Other companies also reported sales increases.  Sherwin-\nWilliams Co. (SHW) , the Cleveland, Ohio-based maker and retailer of\npaints and coatings, saw demand strengthen \u201cin virtually every\nproduct category, every customer segment, in every geographic\nregion,\u201d as first-quarter revenue grew 15 percent from a year\nearlier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Christopher Connor\nsaid on an April 19 conference call.  Market Firming  Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK)  Chief Operating Officer James Loree said the market for housing and home improvement \u201cclearly\nappears to be firming,\u201d and if that continues, it \u201cbodes very\nwell\u201d for the  New Britain , Connecticut-based company. Point-of-\nsales data for its power tools and outdoor products have been\n\u201cvery strong,\u201d so \u201cit would be foolish\u201d to assume the gains\nwere entirely because of weather, he said on an April 19\nconference call.  MasterCard Inc. (MA) , the world\u2019s second-largest payments\nnetwork, also saw recent increases. After \u201clanguishing in\npretty negative territory\u201d about six months ago, sales of\nhardware, electronics and home-improvement products were\n\u201cactually the growth areas\u201d in the last two months, President\nand Chief Executive Officer Ajaypal Banga said on a May 2\nconference call.  Even so,  consumer confidence  still is \u201cnot back to where\nwe\u2019d like to see it,\u201d which hurts expensive projects such as\nkitchen remodeling, Klein said. This business is lagging behind\nthe overall market, as consumers remain \u201ca little cautious.\u201d  Consumer Confidence  Sentiment slipped to  minus 40.4  in the week ended May 6,\nthe lowest in three months, from minus 37.6 the prior week,\nbased on the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index. That\u2019s still more\nthan 12 points above the minus 53.2 October 2011 reading.  Residential real estate also continues to show signs of\nweakness, as sales of previously owned homes unexpectedly fell\n2.6 percent to a  4.48 million  annual rate in March from 4.6\nmillion the prior month, according to data from the National\nAssociation of Realtors. This was the second month of declines;\nthe median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called\nfor an increase to 4.61 million.  Even though housing may have bottomed, it \u201cwon\u2019t be a big\ndriver of performance\u201d this year for Home Depot, Ted Decker,\nsenior vice president of retail finance, said at a March 6\nconference hosted by Raymond James & Associates Inc. The company\nforecasts its 2012 revenue growth will be consistent with\neconomic expansion between 2 percent and 3 percent, he said.  \u2018Roughly Flat\u2019  Industry shipments for household appliances fell 10 percent\nduring the first quarter,  Benton Harbor , Michigan-based\n Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  said April 26. The total for the year will be\n\u201croughly flat, which is at the low end of our previous\nguidance,\u201d Marc Bitzer, president of Whirlpool  North America ,\npredicted on a conference call that day.  Though the housing recovery remains uneven, it tends to\nmove in \u201cvery long\u201d cycles, with the six-year market slump\nthat began in 2006 following an eight-year boom, Ciccarelli\nsaid. Further, Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s are large components of\nportfolio benchmarks such as the S&P 500, so it can be \u201cvery\npainful\u201d for investors to be short or underweight if they\nbelieve the recovery is sustainable, he said.  Shares of Fortune Brands rose  9 percent  on April 27 -- the\nmost since September -- a day after it released first-quarter\nearnings of 8 cents a share, beating the analyst consensus of 3\ncents. Revenue gains have been driven by pent-up demand from\nAmericans who have decided to remodel in lieu of selling their\nhomes or moving, as well as increased  foreclosure  activity that\nis spurring rehab projects, Klein said.  What\u2019s even more encouraging is that the revenue gain isn\u2019t\ncoming from the cheapest cabinets and faucets, he said. Rather,\nthe company\u2019s \u201cfashion products\u201d have had strong sales as\nbuyers balance value with an often long-delayed purchase.  \u201cOur customers are saying, \u2018If I\u2019m going to spend my hard-\nearned money, boy, I want to feel good about it.\u2019\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAnna-Louise Jackson in New York at \n ajackson36@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAnthony Feld at \n afeld2@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. was 20.603416442871094 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Fortune Brands Home & Security, Inc. was ",
