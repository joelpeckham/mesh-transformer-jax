 "context": "The following article called 'IPhone Price Cuts Send Bond Inflation Bets to 11-Year Low' was published on 2012-09-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPrice cuts on everything from\niPhones to Folgers coffee show why investors in U.S. government\nbonds anticipate low inflation for the next decade even as the\n Federal Reserve  considers injecting more cash into the economy.  A  measure  of price-increase predictions used by the Fed to\nset policy, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,\nhas averaged 2.54 percent this year. That\u2019s the lowest since\n2001 for the measure, which gauges expectations for inflation\nbetween 2017 and 2022. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast\nthat 10-year government bonds will yield 1.76 percent by Dec.\n31, down from 2.76 percent in 2011 and 3.19 percent in 2010.  Bond yields show investors expect that soaring gasoline and\ncorn prices will fail to spread throughout the  U.S. economy  amid\na slump in wages and unemployment at more than 8 percent since\nthe beginning of 2009. That\u2019s giving the Fed scope to add to the\n$2.3 trillion of  government securities  it has bought since 2008,\nan option Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week is possible\namid \u201cgrave concern\u201d about joblessness.  \u201cThe  bond market  doesn\u2019t view inflation as a problem,\u201d\nAnthony Valeri, a market strategist in San Diego at LPL\nFinancial, which oversees $350 billion of assets, said Aug. 28\nin a telephone interview. \u201cThe bond market still views\ndeflation as a greater risk to the economy for the next one to\nmaybe two years.\u201d  Tumbling Yields  Treasuries due in  30 years , the securities most sensitive\nto price rises, yield 2.69 percent after touching 2.44 percent\non July 26, the lowest ever. That compares with an average of\n3.9 percent in 2011 and 4.43 percent in the last decade.  U.S.  government bonds  have gained 2.6 percent this year,\naccording to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. That\ncompares with 3.8 percent for German bunds and U.K. gilts.\nAustralian securities have gained 5.7 percent.  Yields on the benchmark 10-year note fell 7.5 basis points,\nthe most in seven days, after Bernanke said on Aug. 31 in\nJackson Hole, Wyoming, that the labor market is a \u201cgrave\nconcern\u201d and that the central bank \u201cwill provide additional\npolicy accommodation as needed.\u201d  \u201cThe economic situation is obviously far from\nsatisfactory,\u201d Bernanke said in his speech. \u201cUnless the\neconomy begins to grow more quickly than it has recently, the\n unemployment rate  is likely to remain far above levels\nconsistent with maximum employment for some time.\u201d  The 10-year yield rose three basis points to 1.58 percent\ntoday. It earlier touched 1.54 percent, the lowest since Aug. 6.  \u2018Constrained\u2019 Budgets  Retailers are responding to sluggish economic growth by\ncutting prices. Sales rose 0.8 percent in July from the previous\nmonth, the biggest increase since February, government figures\nshowed Aug. 14. That followed three straight months of declines,\nincluding a 0.7 percent drop in June, the most since May 2010.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re suffering through in the job market is\nreverberating through the economy,\u201d Adolfo Laurenti, deputy\nchief economist in Chicago at Mesirow Financial Inc., which\noversees $61.7 billion, said in a telephone interview Aug. 27.\n\u201cThese lackluster sales at many major retailers are really\nreflecting the fact that budgets are still constrained.\u201d  Average hourly earnings rose 1.7 percent in July from a\nyear earlier, the smallest increase since December 2010 and down\nfrom a peak of 3.8 percent in June 2007, the latest Labor\nDepartment data show. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index was\nlittle changed at minus 47.3 in the week ended Aug. 26, from the\nprior reading of 47.4 that was the weakest since January.  Price Cuts  J.M. Smucker Co., which owns the Folgers coffee brand,\nlowered retail prices in May by about 6 percent as Arabica bean\nprices fell. Orrville, Ohio-based Smucker sees lower coffee\ncosts for the remainder of the year, President and Chief\nOperating Officer Vincent Byrd said Aug. 17.  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , the world\u2019s largest consumer-products\ncompany, rolled back $400 million of the $3.5 billion in price\nincreases it made last year, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller\nsaid Aug. 3 during a conference call. The move boosted\nCincinnati-based P&G\u2019s U.S. market share of laundry detergents,\nincluding category leader Tide, by 0.6 percent in July, he said.  Bentonville, Arkansas-based  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  cut its\nprice for Apple Inc.\u2019s 16 gigabyte iPhone 4S to $148 from $188,\nwhich was already cheaper than the manufacturer\u2019s suggested\nretail price of $199. Second-quarter sales at Wal-Mart\u2019s U.S.\nstores open at least a year gained 2.2 percent, below the 2.6\npercent in the previous quarter, the company said Aug. 16.  Wal-Mart Cuts  Wal-Mart cut prices on paper household products by 14.1\npercent in August from a year earlier and health and beauty aids\nby 13.7 percent, according to Bloomberg Industries data. The\ncost of laundry goods has climbed 18 percent since September\n2010 at the stores, while household paper items have increased\n2.3 percent, the data show.  The company announced a program discounting gasoline by 15-\ncents-per-gallon on Aug. 29. The average U.S. price of a gallon\nof regular unleaded gasoline has risen 16 percent this year to\n$3.80, according to AAA.  \u201cOur customers are under pressure from the economy,\u201d\nDuncan MacNaughton, chief merchandising officer for the world\u2019s\nbiggest retailer, said that day on a conference call. \u201cWe have\nalways had aggressive prices on gas. This takes it to the next\nlevel.\u201d  A measure of prices tied to  consumer spending  was the same\nin July as in the previous month, according to an Aug. 30\nCommerce Department report. The core personal consumption\nexpenditure deflator, which excludes food and energy costs, rose\n1.6 from a year earlier, down from 2.2 percent in March.  Price Index  The  consumer price index  was unchanged for a second month\nin July after plunging 0.3 percent in May, the most since\nDecember 2008, according to the Labor department.  The Fed\u2019s preferred long-term gauge of the bond market\u2019s\nexpectations for inflation, the five-year, five-year rate, is\ndown from 2.78 percent in March and has averaged 2.74 percent\nduring Bernanke\u2019s tenure since February 2006. That compares with\nan average of 2.67 percent between 2000 and 2010.  There is concern that flooding the financial system with\ncash will eventually spark runaway inflation as the $1.48\ntrillion in  excess reserves  held by U.S. banks feeds back into\nthe financial system.  Commercial and industrial  loans  at banks have risen to\n$1.46 trillion from a post-crisis low of $1.2 trillion in 2010,\naccording to the Fed. The peak was $1.61 trillion in 2008.  \u2018A Conflagration\u2019  \u201cAll of the monetary policy is like filling your house\nbasement with gas and hoping it won\u2019t catch on fire,\u201d Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners LLC,\nsaid Aug. 24 in a telephone interview. \u201cAll it needs is a spark\nand it will be a conflagration,\u201d said Minerd, whose firm\noversees more than $125 billion from Santa Monica, California.  The Republican Party platform adopted at its national\nconvention calls for a commission to investigate a possible\n\u201cmetallic basis for U.S. currency.\u201d  The move was driven by supporters of Representative  Ron\nPaul  of Texas, who has long criticized the Fed\u2019s control of the\n money supply  and wants to revive the link between gold and the\ndollar to preserve the currency\u2019s value.  President Barack Obama will accept the  Democratic Party \u2019s\nnomination for reelection this week at their convention in\nCharlotte, North Carolina. Lower inflation and bond yields have\nhelped his administration finance a fourth-straight deficit\nexceeding $1 trillion.  Interest Burden  The Congressional Budget Office forecasts interest on\n government debt  will equal 1.4 percent of  gross domestic product \nthis fiscal year, less than the 3.1 percent when Democrat  Bill\nClinton  ran for re-election in 1996 and 3.2 percent when\nRepublican  George H.W. Bush  ran in 1992.  Investors remain bullish on bonds, in part, because wages\nare stagnating even though commodities prices have risen.  Food price inflation caused by the worsening U.S. drought,\nas well as higher gasoline prices, is being offset by employment\nand wages that have failed to recover sufficiently, Valeri said.  Corn has surged 57 percent since June 15, reaching a record\n$8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10, as the drought parched millions of\nacres across the U.S. Soybeans gained 33 percent since mid-June\nand reached a record $17.605 a bushel on Aug. 27. Oil touched a\n15-week high of $98.29 on Aug. 23, and gained 20.9 percent on\nAug. 31 to $96.47, as Tropical Storm Isaac strengthened,\ncrimping output in the  Gulf of Mexico .  \u201cThe real driver of inflation is labor costs, how much\npeople are making,\u201d  LPL Financial \u2019s Valeri said. \u201cSalaries\naren\u2019t increasing much at all.\u201d Valeri said he favors\nintermediate-maturity corporate bonds because \u201c interest rates \nare going to stay low for a while.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nJohn Detrixhe in  New York  at \n jdetrixhe1@bloomberg.net ;  To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDave Liedtka at   dliedtka@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 58.733314514160156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
