 "context": "The following article called 'Travelers Profit Doubles to $864 Million, Beats Estimates' was published on 2012-10-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTravelers Cos. (TRV)  led a rally of\nproperty-casualty insurers after reporting that profit more than\ndoubled on lower claims costs tied to natural disasters.  Travelers advanced 3.7 percent to $74.05 at 9:45 a.m. in\nNew York, the biggest gain in the 30-company  Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average . Operating profit, which excludes some\ninvestment results, was $2.22 a share, beating the $1.60 average\n estimate  of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The insurer beat estimates on \u201cbetter-than-expected core\nunderwriting margins, catastrophe losses, and net investment\nincome,\u201d said  Meyer Shields , an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus &\nCo., in a note to investors today. \u201cTravelers\u2019 low catastrophe\nlosses likely bode well\u201d for rivals such as Allstate Corp.,\nwhich haven\u2019t yet reported third-quarter results.  Travelers Chief Executive Officer Jay Fishman, 59, has\nbought back shares, raised rates for coverage and changed policy\nterms to improve shareholder returns as near record-low  interest\nrates  pressure income from the investment portfolio. Property-\ncasualty insurers have benefited from fewer natural disasters\nthis year after record losses in 2011.  The insurer\u2019s third-quarter net income advanced to $864\nmillion, or $2.21 per share, from $333 million, or 79 cents, a\nyear earlier, the New York-based company said today in a\nstatement. Catastrophes cost Travelers $91 million in the\nquarter before tax and net of reinsurance, compared with $606\nmillion a year earlier when  Hurricane Irene  struck the U.S.  Allstate, the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto\ninsurer, advanced 1.5 percent. Chubb Corp., which competes with\nTravelers selling commercial coverage, jumped 2.5 percent. Ace\nLtd. gained 2.3 percent.  Return on Equity  Travelers\u2019 operating return on equity climbed to 15.5\npercent from 5.9 percent a year earlier. Fishman has said he\u2019s\ntargeting a mid-teens return on equity over time even as more\nsevere weather and low interest rates make that goal less\nrealistic in the short term.  \u201cWe remain committed to continuing to improve\nprofitability through a strategy of actively, but selectively,\nseeking price increases and improved terms and conditions, given\nhistorically low interest rates and uncertain weather\npatterns,\u201d Fishman said in the statement.  The insurer said it charged higher rates in all units. At\nits commercial accounts, the renewal premium change was a gain\nof 9.8 percent. Policy sales were little changed as the company\nretained a lower percent of clients than a year earlier in most\nof its reporting segments.  Travelers\u2019 book value per share, a measure of assets minus\nliabilities, rose to $67.81 from $64.90 at the end of June. The\ncompany repurchased $350 million of stock in the third quarter\nand expects to exceed that amount in the fourth quarter, Chief\nFinancial Officer Jay Benet said on a conference call today.
