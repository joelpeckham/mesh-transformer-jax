The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStocks and commodities rose in\nOctober, Treasuries fell for the first time since March and the\ndollar weakened to a 15-year low against the yen as investors\nbet the Federal Reserve will act to boost growth and corporate\nearnings topped estimates.  The MSCI World Index of shares in developed nations gained\n3.7 percent, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 2.8\npercent. The Thomson Reuters/CRB Index of commodities climbed to\na two-year high as cotton, corn, soybeans and gold rallied.\nTreasuries lost 0.4 percent, Bank of America Corp. indexes\nshowed.

Fed policy makers meet Nov. 2-3 to consider stimulating the\nworld\u2019s largest economy through an asset-purchase technique\nknown as quantitative easing. Central bankers are concerned that\ngrowth is too slow to curb U.S. unemployment that\u2019s stuck near\nthe 26-year high reached in October 2009. The Standard & Poor\u2019s\n500 Index built on its biggest September rally since 1939 as\nmore than 70 percent of companies beat profit forecasts for the\nsixth straight quarter, the longest stretch since at least 1993.  \u201cThe Fed is trying to shove money out the risk spectrum,\nand I think it\u2019s happening,\u201d said  William Greiner , chief\ninvestment officer at Scout Investment Advisors in Kansas City,\nwhich manages $9.5 billion. \u201cBusiness people are starting to get\nthe sense that a double-dip recession is not going to happen for\nthe time being. It wasn\u2019t more than 90 days ago that people were\nreally concerned.\u201d  Querying Dealers  The central bank has asked bond dealers and investors for\nprojections of central bank asset purchases over the next six\nmonths as it seeks to gauge the possible impact of new efforts\nto spur growth. The Fed has kept the benchmark interest rate at\nbetween zero percent and 0.25 percent since December 2008 and\nbought $1.7 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed assets.  Estimates for the size of the Fed\u2019s next round of asset\npurchases range from $1 trillion at Bank of America to $2\ntrillion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Economists at both firms\nagree the Fed may start by announcing a $500 billion plan.  Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing in five\nyears were sold at a negative yield for the first time ever at a\nU.S. debt auction in October, signaling bets that Fed Chairman\n Ben S. Bernanke  will be successful in preventing deflation and\nthe risk of another recession.  Thinking About Inflation  The yield \u201ccertainly suggests investors are starting to\nthink about inflation as a concern,\u201d said  Sandy Lincoln , chief\ninvestment strategist at M&I Investment Management Corp. in\nMilwaukee, which oversees about $30 billion.  The Oct. 25 sale of $10 billion of the securities drew a\nyield of negative 0.55 percent, matching the average forecast in\na Bloomberg News survey of 7 of the Fed\u2019s 18 primary dealers.  Surging asset prices helped spur debt and equity offerings.  Sales of junk bonds in the U.S. set a record for October as\nreturns topped investment-grade debt and more borrowers were\nraised than cut.  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.  and  Calpine Corp.  led\nspeculative-grade companies issuing $33 billion of debt this\nmonth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The notes have\ngained 2.32 percent on average in October, compared with a loss\nof 0.16 percent for high-grade securities, Bank of America index\ndata show.

TGLT SA , an\nArgentine real-estate developer, completed the first IPO in\nBuenos Aires in more than two years yesterday.  \u201cThe market manages to consistently catch most people off\nguard,\u201d said  Eric Mintz , who helps oversee $3.3 billion at Eagle\nAsset Management in St. Petersburg, Florida. \u201cThe consensus\nheading into September and October was for a continued\ncorrection as we had seen in August. The gains clearly surprised\na lot of investors as the liquidity in the market is pushing up\nasset prices across the board.\u201d  Beating Estimates  The gain in equities followed companies from Alcoa Inc. to\nGoogle Inc. and Citigroup Inc.  beating  the average analyst\nprofit estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The fiber rose to a record $1.305 on Oct. 26.

The Dollar Index, which measures the\nU.S. currency against the euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar,\nSwedish krona and Swiss franc, sank 2.1 percent to 77.04.  \u201cThe fear of a currency devaluation led investors to lock\ninto something that could restore their wealth,\u201d said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps oversee $13.3 billion at Huntington Asset\nAdvisors in Cincinnati. \u201cWith commodities and stocks going up,\nthat\u2019s not a good environment\u201d for Treasuries, he said.
