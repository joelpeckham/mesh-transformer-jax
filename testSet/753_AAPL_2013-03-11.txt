(6758)  board Chairman Howard Stringer, who became the first non-Japanese executive to lead the company, said he will retire in June.  Stringer, 71, will step down at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, he said last week in a speech at the  Japan  Society in New York. Kazuo Hirai, 52, succeeded him as chief executive officer about a year ago.  A surprise choice for CEO in June 2005, the Welsh-born Stringer struggled to bring Sony into a digital age where rivals offered phones and TVs with more features at often lower prices. Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s efficient manufacturing and the success of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPod and iPad forced him to focus on cutting costs. Sony posted a record 457 billion-yen ($4.8 billion) loss in the 12 months ended March 2012, Stringer\u2019s last year as chief executive of the Tokyo-based company.  \u201cConsidering the poor earnings result last year, he should have stepped down even earlier,\u201d said Yasuo Nakane, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. \u201cHis departure means Sony has completed the transition to a new management team. It\u2019s positive for the company.\u201d  Stringer informed Hirai about his exit plan earlier this year, Shiro Kambe, a Tokyo-based Sony spokesman, said by phone on March 9. Sony\u2019s board will discuss replacement candidates and a final decision on a successor will be made after the June shareholder meeting, he said.  \u201cHoward\u2019s achievements as CEO of Sony are innumerable; from breaking down silos and driving \u2018Sony United,\u2019 to fundamentally realigning the focus of Sony\u2019s product development,\u201d Hirai said in a statement.  \u2018New World\u2019  Sony, Japan\u2019s largest consumer-electronics exporter,  rose  1.7 percent to 1,489 yen as of 9:41 a.m. in  Tokyo  trading, compared with a 0.6 percent gain in Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. The shares have advanced 55 percent this year as the weakening yen boosts Japanese exporters\u2019 overseas earnings.  Stringer said he will probably sit on boards in the health- care and education fields and will continue as chairman of the American Film Institute, among other pursuits.  \u201cA new world is opening up for me,\u201d Stringer said, according to a transcript provided by Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the company. \u201cThat will allow me to move forward with new opportunities.\u201d  Selling Assets  Hirai has been selling Sony assets including its U.S. headquarters in New York and another building in Tokyo to reach profitability. He wants to generate 70 percent of revenue and 85 percent of operating profit in Sony\u2019s electronics from games, digital imaging and mobile devices by March 2015.  The former head of the PlayStation unit has been continuing an effort led by Stringer to enable Sony\u2019s Bravia televisions, Handycam camcorders and Xperia phones to communicate with each other.  \u201cStringer had a real tough job when he took over the company,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, principal analyst and technology consultant at Creative Strategies Inc. in San Jose,  California . \u201cThey\u2019ve made some significant strides since, but still have some siloed businesses that still don\u2019t work in harmony the way they need to.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Cliff Edwards in San Francisco at  cedwards28@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at  apalazzo@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 13.414466857910156 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
