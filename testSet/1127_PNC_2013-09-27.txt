 "context": "The following article called 'Banks Pressed by U.S. Lawmakers for Details on College Deals' was published on 2013-09-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDemocratic lawmakers including\nSenator Elizabeth Warren today demanded that eight U.S. banks\nproduce information about agreements they may have with colleges\nto encourage students to use their products.  \u201cThese lucrative deals are great for banks and great for\ncolleges, but students can get hurt when they are steered into\nfinancial products that carry high fees,\u201d the group of\nlawmakers wrote in the letter to  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Wells Fargo &\nCo. and six other banks.  They cited a 2012  report  by the U.S. Public Interest\nResearch Group that said more than 9 million students risk being\n\u201cnickeled and dimed\u201d by fees stemming from deals in which\ncolleges allow financial firms to manage federal financial aid\ndisbursement through checking accounts and prepaid debit cards.\nThe consumer organization also said in its report that banks pay\ncolleges \u201ckickbacks\u201d to get the deals.  The letter came from lawmakers including Warren, of\nMassachusetts, the former head of the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau; Representative Maxine Waters, of California,\nthe ranking member of the Finance Committee; and Representative\nGeorge Miller of California, the top Democrat on the House\nEducation and Workforce Committee.  The letter also went to chief executives of  U.S. Bancorp (USB) ,\n PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI) , TCF\nBank,  Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN)  and  Commerce Bancshares Inc. (CBSH) \nHigher One Holdings Inc., a New Haven, Connecticut-based company\nthat provides financial services to students, was also sent a\ncopy of the letter.  Banks\u2019 Incentive  Consumer Bankers Association president  Richard Hunt , whose\ngroup represents most of the banks addressed by the letter, said\nthe lenders are best placed to serve students via these so-called affinity agreements.  \u201cUnlike many non-bank providers operating in this space,\nbanks have every incentive to ensure students have a positive\nexperience, as they hope to foster a long-term relationship,\u201d\nHunt said in an e-mail.  Shoba Lemoine, a spokeswoman for Higher One, which is not a\ndeposit-taking bank, said the letter \u201cshines a spotlight on\nrevenue-sharing deals between big banks\u201d and institutions of\nhigher learning. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this model prioritizes the\nstudents\u2019 best interests,\u201d Lemoine said in an e-mail.  Student financial products will be the topic of a Sept. 30\nWashington forum planned by the consumer bureau. CFPB Director\n Richard Cordray  and the bureau\u2019s student loan ombudsman, Rohit Chopra, will be among the speakers, according to a bureau news\nrelease.
