 "context": "The following article called 'JPMorgan, BofA Sued by New York Over Use of Mortgage Database' was published on 2012-02-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJPMorgan Chase & Co .,  Bank of America\nCorp.  and  Wells Fargo & Co . were sued by New York Attorney\nGeneral  Eric Schneiderman  over the use of a mortgage database\nthat the state said led to improper foreclosures.  The banks\u2019 use of the database, known as MERS, misled\nhomeowners, undermined foreclosure proceedings and created\nuncertainty about ownership interests in properties, the state\nsaid in the complaint filed yesterday in New York State Supreme\nCourt in  Brooklyn .  \u201cThe banks created the MERS system as an end-run around\nthe property recording system, to facilitate the rapid\nsecuritization and sale of mortgages,\u201d Schneiderman said in a\nstatement. \u201cOnce the mortgages went sour, these same banks\nbrought foreclosure proceedings en masse based on deceptive and\nfraudulent court submissions.\u201d  The lawsuit came three days before a Feb. 6 deadline for\nstates to join a proposed multistate agreement over foreclosure\npractices said to be worth as much as $25 billion. Last week,\nSchneiderman was selected by the Obama administration to help\nlead a state-federal group probing misconduct in the packaging\nand sale of residential mortgage-backed securities.  Servicing Rights  MERS tracks servicing rights and ownership interests in\n mortgage loans  on its electronic registry, allowing banks to buy\nand sell loans without recording transfers with individual\ncounties. The system was created by the mortgage industry to\nevade recording fees, avoid the need to publicly record mortgage\ntransfers and facilitate the packaging of mortgage loans into\nsecurities, Schneiderman said in the complaint.  Merscorp Inc. , which operates the mortgage registry, was\nsued by Delaware Attorney General  Beau Biden  last year. Biden\nclaimed the registry is deceptive and harms consumers by\npermitting foreclosures \u201cfor which the authority has not been\nfully determined and may not be legitimate.\u201d  Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Reston, Virginia-based\nMerscorp, which was also named as a defendant in the  New York \ncomplaint, said in an e-mailed statement that the company\nrejects the attorney general\u2019s allegations and will fight the\nsuit.  Reviewing Complaint  Rick Simon , a spokesman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-based\nBank of America, and  Tom Kelly , a spokesman for New York-based\nJPMorgan, declined to comment on the suit. Tom Goyda, a\nspokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, said the bank was\nreviewing the complaint.  The state\u2019s complaint, which couldn\u2019t be immediately\nverified in court records yesterday, states that MERS eliminated\nthe ability of the public and homeowners to track the purchase\nand sale of properties through the traditional public records\nsystem. That information is stored in the MERS private database,\nwhich Schneiderman called unreliable and inaccurate. The\nmortgage industry has saved more than\n$2 billion in recording fees with the system, according to the\ncomplaint.  Use of Registry  Banks\u2019 use of the registry, coupled with \u201cfaulty and\nsloppy\u201d document preparation, has resulted in foreclosures\nbeing filed against New York homeowners where the foreclosing\nparty lacked the authority to sue, Schneiderman said.  By relying on legally invalid mortgage assignments using\nMERS, foreclosure judgments have been obtained \u201cthrough\nfraudulent and illegal means,\u201d according to the complaint.  MERS\u2019 conduct and the banks\u2019 use of the system \u201chave\nresulted in the filing of improper New York foreclosure\nproceedings, undermined the integrity of the judicial process,\ncreated confusion and uncertainty concerning property ownership\ninterests and potentially created clouds of title on properties\nthroughout the state of New York,\u201d the state said.
