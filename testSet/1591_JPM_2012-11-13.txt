 "context": "The following article called 'Scrapping ECB Plan, Popular Discount, CME: Compliance' was published on 2012-11-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe European Union may scrap plans\nto give the European Central Bank sole power to grant and\nwithdraw banking licenses in the euro area as nations tussle\nover the details of setting up a single supervisor.  Some EU countries insist \u201cthat the key issue of access to\nand removal from the market should remain within the remit of\nnational authorities,\u201d according to  a document  on the bloc\u2019s\nwebsite, which doesn\u2019t name the countries. Some governments have\nalso pushed for the power to grant and withdraw licenses to stay\nat the national level unless and until the EU sets up a central\nsystem to handle failing banks, according to the document.  This debate means the proposal will be revised, the\ndocument says. EU finance ministers also may adjust the\ntimetable for the ECB to take on bank oversight tasks because of\nconcerns that plans to fully phase in the responsibilities by\nJan. 1, 2014, may not be feasible, according the document.  Squabbling among EU nations may derail the bloc\u2019s bid to\nreach agreement by the end of the year on how to make the ECB a\nsupervisor. Nations are split over how to give a voice to non-\neuro nations that volunteer for ECB supervision, according to\nthe document, which was prepared for a meeting of EU finance\nministers today in Brussels. They also disagree on how to divide\nup tasks between the ECB and national regulators.  For more, click here.  Compliance Policy  EU\u2019s Semeta Urges \u2018Quick Progress\u2019 on Financial Transaction Tax  European Union Tax  Commissioner Algirdas Semeta called on\nfinance ministers to make \u201cquick progress\u201d toward a financial-\ntransaction tax for participating nations.  All 27 nations and the European Parliament must agree for\nthe Brussels-based commission to design a tax for willing\nnations under so-called \u201cenhanced cooperation\u201d procedures. The\ncommission requested clearance last month.  Semeta told lawmakers yesterday he will urge finance\nministers gathering in Brussels to push the measure forward when\nhe addresses them today. The commissioner is expected to speak\nat a meeting of the European Parliament budget committee.  The EU\u2019s new transaction-tax proposal will be based on a\nprevious plan that, when considered for all 27 EU nations, was\nestimated to be able to raise 57 billion euros ($72 billion)\neach year. Semeta said the EU would revise its revenue estimates\nand also take into account concerns raised with the previous\ninitiative.  Eleven nations so far have said that they would like to be\npart of the transaction-tax planning. Semeta said EU lawmakers\ncould consider the transaction tax as early as a December\nplenary debate. He also called on EU finance ministers to move\nahead with a proposed savings tax that has been stalled.  Compliance Action  Popular Selling Stock at Discount to Cover Capital Deficit  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)  plans to sell as much as 2.5\nbillion euros ($3.2 billion) of discounted shares as the Spanish\nlender bids to close a capital shortfall.

Courts  CME Lawsuit Over CFTC\u2019s Swap-Database Rule Faulted by DTCC  CME Group Inc. (CME) \u2019s lawsuit over U.S. Commodity Futures\nTrading Commission swap-data rules will undermine efforts to\nboost transparency following the 2008 credit crisis, the\nDepository Trust & Clearing Corp. said.  The suit, filed in federal court on Nov. 8, \u201cthreatens to\ndismantle and disrupt the entire regulatory regime statutorily\nmandated by the Dodd-Frank Act in order to preserve CME\u2019s\nexclusive access to data that it acquires through its role as a\nderivatives clearing organization,\u201d DTCC general counsel Larry\nE. Thompson said in a letter to the CFTC Nov. 11.  CME, the Chicago-based exchange operator that runs a swaps\nclearinghouse, is seeking an injunction against CFTC rules for\nreporting private trade information, claiming that submissions\nto so-called swap-data repositories would be redundant. DTCC,\nbased in New York, is one of the firms given CFTC approval to\nrun data repositories for  interest rate  and credit-default\nswaps, among other types of trades.  Dodd-Frank, the 2010 financial-regulation overhaul,\ndirected the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission to\nwrite rules for swap-data repositories to give regulators a\nbetter view on prices and volume in a $648 trillion market\ndominated by banks including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  JPMorgan\nChase & Co. (JPM)  and Deutsche Bank AG.  The CFTC has granted provisional registration to DTCC Data\nRepository LLC and ICE Trade Vault LLC, a repository operated by\nAtlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange Inc. for information on\nenergy, interest rate, credit and other swaps.  Steve Adamske , the CFTC\u2019s spokesman, didn\u2019t respond to\ntelephone and e-mail requests for comment while U.S. government\noffices are closed for observance of Veterans Day.  CME said in the lawsuit that it is awaiting a response from\nCFTC on its June 7 application to become a data repository.  The case is Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. v. U.S.\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, 12-cv-01820, U.S. District\nCourt,  District of Columbia  ( Washington ).  For more, click here.

Comings and Goings  Barclays Saudi Probe Adds to CEO Jenkins\u2019s Regulatory Woes  Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins , almost\ntwo years after his predecessor said it was time for banks to\nstop apologizing, is still grappling with a multiplying number\nof  probes  by regulators.  The  U.S. Department of Justice  is investigating whether the\nlender made payments that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct to win a banking license for its wealth-management unit and\ninvestment bank in Saudi Arabia, the Financial Times reported on\nNov. 9, citing unidentified people familiar with the talks. The\nbank is already being probed by the  Serious Fraud Office  over\nfees it paid in 2009 to Qatar\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund as the\nlender sought money to avoid a government bailout.  For Jenkins, who replaced  Robert Diamond  after the lender\npaid a record fine for manipulating Libor, the probes are likely\nto be a bigger setback to his efforts to show politicians the\nbank can put regulatory missteps behind it than the size of any\nfines, according to analysts. He may have to include stiffer\ninternal controls to detect staff who break laws in pursuit of\n revenue  when he announces the results of his review of\nBarclays\u2019s operations in February, said  Christopher Wheeler , a\nLondon-based banking analyst at Mediobanca SpA.  U.S. regulators this month also proposed levying a record\n$470 million in penalties on Barclays after it allegedly gamed\nenergy markets in the Western U.S. from late 2006 to 2008.  John McGuinness, a Barclays spokesman, and the Department\nof Justice\u2019s Rebekah Carmichael declined to comment on the Saudi\nprobe.  For more, click here.
