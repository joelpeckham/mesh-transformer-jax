 "context": "The following article called 'Bank of America Targets Up to $3 Billion in Additional Cuts, Moynihan Says' was published on 2012-01-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of America Corp. , the second-\nbiggest U.S. lender by assets, may reduce annual costs by as\nmuch as an additional $3 billion in the next stage of Chief\nExecutive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan \u2019s efficiency plan.  The lender, which already targeted $5 billion in expense\ncuts from retail and back-office operations, may reach total\nsavings of $6 billion to $8 billion a year, Moynihan said during\na Jan. 19 employee meeting. The latest  phase  of his effort\nexamines investment and commercial banking, trading, and wealth-\nmanagement units and is scheduled to be completed in April.  Moynihan, 52, is relying on cuts after mortgage losses and\nU.S. regulation drained revenue last year. In the first part of\nhis plan, dubbed Project New BAC, the CEO announced 30,000 job\ncuts from  consumer banking , credit-card, home loan and support\noperations at the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based lender.  Managers will reduce the \u201coverall cost structure of the\ncompany; through New BAC we\u2019ve identified $5 billion,\u201d Moynihan\nsaid last week. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick up more in Phase 2, that ought to\nget you $1.5 billion to $2 billion a quarter\u201d in total savings.  Moynihan has told analysts that his latest round of cost\ncuts will yield smaller savings than the first because there are\nfewer employees in corporate and institutional units. Expenses\nwill start to decline in the second half of this year, he has\nsaid.  Larry DiRita , a spokesman for the bank, declined to\ncomment on Moynihan\u2019s remarks to employees.  \u2018Got To Do More\u2019  The push to reduce costs has stoked anxiety among the\n 284,635  workers the lender had as of Dec. 31. Moynihan in\nSeptember unveiled initial details of his plan, which divides\nthe company into two parts, each with roughly $27 billion in\nannual expenses. Wall Street firms including Barclays Plc and\nCredit Suisse Group AG have dismissed staff as revenue from\ntrading stocks and bonds has eroded.  \u201cWhat is the right fixed-cost structure given what we see\nin the market conditions and opportunities?\u201d Moynihan said last\nweek during a conference call with analysts. \u201cWe need that\nbusiness to come back or we\u2019ve got to do more in expenses.\u201d  Moynihan highlighted the firm\u2019s improvement in capital\nlevels, accomplished mostly through asset sales. The bank\u2019s Tier\n1 common equity ratio, a measure of the ability to absorb\nunexpected losses, rose to 9.86 percent from 8.65 percent in the\nthird quarter.  \u2018Leaner, Meaner\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019ve made good progress transforming this company into\nthat leaner, meaner, fighting machine off all the acquisitions\nand all the crises that happened,\u201d Moynihan told staff.  The lender posted a $1.99 billion fourth-quarter profit\nfueled by one-time gains including the sale of holdings in a\nChinese bank. Analysts including  Todd Hagerman  of Sterne Agee &\nLeach Inc. estimated the core results were a loss.  The bank had $4 billion in net revenue before taxes and\nprovisions in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Bruce R. Thompson said during last week\u2019s meeting. The company aims to\nmore than double that figure to $10 billion, mostly through cost\nsavings and improved trading results, he said.  \u201cThis has got to be a change we make very quickly,\u201d\nThompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s going from getting capital and liquidity\nto getting back to, \u2018How do we get the earnings stream of this\ncompany back to where we want it to be?\u2019\u201d  Bank of America advanced 18 cents to $7.25 at 4:15 p.m. in\n New York . The firm has  surged  30 percent this year, the most in\nthe  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) , as investors bet that an\nimproving U.S. economy will buoy earnings. The lender was\npummeled last year with a 58 percent decline, the worst in the\n30-company Dow index.  \u201cHappy New Year,\u201d Moynihan said during the Jan. 19\nemployee meeting. \u201cIt\u2019s a happier New Year today with the stock\nprice up a little bit, right?\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nHugh Son in New York at   hson1@bloomberg.net ;  To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n David Scheer  at \n dscheer@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank of America Corporation was 6.117740154266357 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank of America Corporation was ",
