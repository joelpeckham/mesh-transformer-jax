 "context": "The following article called 'Chevron Bid to Dismiss $18 Billion Award Rejected in Ecuador' was published on 2012-01-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChevron Corp. (CVX)  lost its challenge to\nan $18 billion judgment before an Ecuador appeals court in a\nlawsuit alleging the company is responsible for chemicals\nspilled in the Amazon River basin more than 20 years ago.  The decision upholding the lower-court judgment was issued\nby a panel of three judges in the Provincial Court of Justice of\nSucumbios in  Lago Agrio , Ecuador, Chevron said in an e-mailed\nstatement yesterday.  Chevron appealed a February ruling that it was responsible\nfor chemical-laden wastewater dumped in jungle land from 1964 to\nabout 1992 by Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001.  The appeals court\u2019s decision \u201cgives us the ability to go\nahead and enforce the judgment in any part of the world we see\nlegally fit,\u201d Pablo Fajardo, an attorney representing 30,000\nEcuadorean Amazon residents who sued, said in a conference call\nfrom  Quito . \u201cWe will investigate and look at various continents\naround the world where Chevron has assets.\u201d  Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company, has no\nassets or operations in Ecuador. The plaintiffs must wait until\nthe appeals court makes its decision final, which could take at\nleast a two weeks, before moving ahead with enforcement actions\nin foreign courts, Fajardo said.  The Ecuador appeals court could require  San Ramon ,\nCalifornia-based Chevron to post a bond equal to a percentage of\nthe $18 billion judgment, Fajardo said. Bond payment would block\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 ability to enforce the judgment elsewhere\npending the outcome of a further appeal by Chevron to the\ncountry\u2019s highest court, he said. The bond should be at least $3\nbillion, Fajardo said; the amount is up to the appeals court.  \u2018Glaring Example\u2019  The \u201cdecision is another glaring example of the\npoliticization and corruption of  Ecuador \u2019s judiciary that has\nplagued this fraudulent case from the start,\u201d Chevron said in\nyesterday\u2019s statement. The company \u201cdoes not believe that the\nEcuador ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the\nrule of law.\u201d  The appeals court ratified the February ruling \u201cin all of\nits parts, including the conviction for moral reparation or its\nalternative and costs,\u201d according to the decision.  Chevron is still reviewing the ruling and hasn\u2019t decided\nwhat it will do next, Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the\ncompany, said yesterday in a phone interview. He said the\ncompany \u201chas a procedural right to seek clarification and\namplification from the court that issued this ruling.\u201d  Chevron\u2019s Options  Chevron can also appeal the decision to the next level of\nEcuador\u2019s judiciary, Robertson said.  Karen Hinton , a spokeswoman for lawyers representing the\nEcuador residents who sued Chevron, said in an e-mailed\nstatement, \u201cThe decision by an independent appellate court is\nyet further confirmation of Chevron\u2019s extraordinary greed and\ncriminal misconduct in Ecuador.\u201d  Chevron filed a claim in 2009 against Ecuador in the\nPermanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague seeking orders that\nit has no liability for the environmental pollution and that\nPetroEcuador, the state-owned  oil company  that took over the\nsite, should pay the damage award. In those proceedings, Ecuador\nwas told in February to prevent enforcement of the judgment\nuntil further order by the tribunal, Chevron said yesterday.  \u2018Not Good\u2019  In September, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York\noverturned a lower-court decision blocking enforcement of the\naward by the court in Ecuador.  \u201cThis is not good for Chevron, although it was expected,\u201d\n Fadel Gheit , an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said in a phone\ninterview today. \u201cChevron will exhaust all legal options, which\ncould drag for years.\u201d  Gheit said that he expected Chevron to eventually pay $2\nbillion to $3 billion.  \u201cWe are going to have to watch this play out through the\ninternational court system and the U.S. court system,\u201d Brian Youngberg, an Edward Jones analyst in  St. Louis , said in a phone\ninterview.  \u201cIt is going to be dragged out,\u201d said Youngberg, who\nrates Chevron shares a \u201cbuy\u201d and doesn\u2019t own any.  \u2018Very Content\u2019  Investors still expect the ultimate outcome won\u2019t \u201ccost\nthe company,\u201d Youngberg said. \u201cThere is really very little\nthat Ecuador can go after in the country and Chevron doesn\u2019t\nreally have any material assets there.\u201d  Hinton said that the plaintiffs will seek to enforce the\njudgment in countries where Chevron has assets.  Ecuador President  Rafael Correa  said he was \u201cvery\ncontent\u201d with the ruling.  \u201cI believe justice has been done,\u201d Correa said on public\nradio station Radio Publica. \u201cMore or less it\u2019s like David\nversus Goliath.\u201d  Chevron fell 16 cents to $110.21 at 3 p.m. in  New York \nStock Exchange composite trading.
