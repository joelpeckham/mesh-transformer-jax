 "context": "The following article called 'Pemex Board Approves Joint Venture With Mexichem Without Changes' was published on 2013-01-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPetroleos Mexicanos , the world\u2019s\nfourth-largest oil producer, approved a petrochemical joint\nventure yesterday with  Mexichem SAB (MEXCHEM*)  that had been postponed\nsince the agreement was announced in June 2011.  The board of the state-owned company known as Pemex\napproved the project without changes, Hector Moreira, a\ndirector, said yesterday in a phone interview from Mexico City.  Mexichem will contribute about 60 percent of the $556\nmillion in assets that the new company owns and will invest\nabout $200 million in the project. The Latin American chemical\nproducer has bought more than 15 companies since 2007.  Pemex, based in Mexico City, expects to boost vinyl\nchloride production, or VCM, to more than 400,000 tons annually,\nwhich represents an increase of 105 percent from its 12-month\noutput through November. The deal, which gained antitrust\napproval 15 months ago, had waited for Pemex board backing amid\ndisagreements with union representatives holding five of the\nboard\u2019s 15 seats.  \u201cThe proposal was supported by the union members,\u201d said\nMoreira, who is one of four independent directors added to\nPemex\u2019s board in 2009.  The board also ratified appointments of new executives by\nChief Executive Officer Emilio Lozoya, who took over Dec. 1,\nPemex said in a e-mailed  statement .  New Executives  Mario Beauregard, former CFO of OHL  Mexico  SAB and Su\nCasita SA, will take over as chief financial officer, and Victor\nDiaz was named as chief administration officer.  Mexichem gained as much as 2.4 percent since  Bloomberg News \nreported Jan. 15 that the venture was scheduled for a vote at\nyesterday\u2019s meeting. The stock closed at 72.81 pesos in Mexico\nCity yesterday and has gained 75 percent in the past year.  \u201cThis is a watershed event for the chemical and\npetrochemical industries in Mexico,\u201d said Enrique Ortega,\nMexichem\u2019s director of strategic planning and investor\nrelations. The model of the state-owned company working with the\nprivate sector may spark renewed petrochemical investment and\nactivity, he said yesterday in a telephone interview.  On Sept. 17, then-Pemex CEO,  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  said\nthe Mexichem joint venture model will prompt similar projects\nfor the oil producer with private petrochemical companies.  Mexichem is cutting costs after acquiring suppliers or\nmerging them to create lower-cost projects. The company paid\nabout $580 million in May to buy more than 90 percent of Wavin\nNV in its largest purchase as it expands overseas to diversify\nrevenue sources.  Mexichem, based in Tlalnepantla, Mexico, said Nov. 22 that\nmultiple delays by Pemex prompted the chemical maker to seek\nexpansion outside Mexico for its VCM production.  Mexichem said Aug. 16 that it was in talks with a unit of\n Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  to build a $1 billion ethylene\nfacility to meet the Mexican chemical maker\u2019s goal of having its\nown guaranteed supply of polyvinyl chloride.  The chemical producer, controlled by billionaire Antonio del Valle, wants to reduce its dependence on third-party vinyl\nchloride producers such as  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  VCM is a raw\nmaterial used to make plastic pipes.
