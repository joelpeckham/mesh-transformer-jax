 "context": "The following article called 'Microsoft Sets Xbox One Release as Sony Faceoff Awaits' was published on 2013-09-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)  plans to release the\nXbox One video-game console on Nov. 22, a week before Black\nFriday, and said it increased the number of units available for\nits holiday faceoff against  Sony (6758)  Corp.  Consumer demand spurred Microsoft to speed production after\nretailers sold out of pre-order allotments, said  Yusuf Mehdi ,\nchief marketing officer for the Redmond, Washington-based\nsoftware maker\u2019s interactive entertainment division. Sales this\nyear will top the debut of the current  Xbox 360 , he said,\ndeclining to discuss specifics.  \u201cWe\u2019re building more consoles for day one and for the\nholidays than we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Mehdi said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cIt is on track to be the biggest launch by a wide\nmargin, much bigger than what we did for Xbox 360.\u201d  Microsoft and Sony are betting that faster machines\nallowing for features such as motion capture and immersive\ngraphics will entice consumers whose tastes are shifting toward\nmobile games played on tablets and smartphones. Microsoft, which\nis buying  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) \u2019s handset unit, is stregthening a push into\nhardware as demand weakens for programs such as Windows that\nmade it the world\u2019s largest software maker.  Microsoft also has increased the speed of the Xbox One\u2019s\ncentral processing unit to 1.75 GHz, 10 percent more than\npreviously targeted, Mehdi said.  \u201cYou are now able to have even better fidelity of the\ngames,\u201d Mehdi said. \u201cThe system itself will work much\nfaster.\u201d  Console Prices  Retailers began taking orders for the $499 Xbox One and\nSony\u2019s coming PlayStation 4 in June. Last month, Grapevine,\nTexas-based  GameStop Corp. (GME)  raised its profit forecast, citing\nstrength in console orders.  Microsoft, the top U.S.  seller  of consoles for more than\ntwo years, will debut the Xbox One a week later than the $399\nPS4, which hits American stores on Nov. 15.  Nintendo Co. (7974)  last\nweek cut the price of the Wii U by $50 to $299. The console,\nintroduced last year, has missed company sales targets.  Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is the\ntraditional start to the shopping season in the U.S., with\nretailers offering discounts to draw customers.  Microsoft will release the Xbox One in 13 countries all on\nthe same day, giving it a week\u2019s head start in  Europe , where the\nPS4 starts selling on Nov. 29. Sony will reach stores in 32\nmarkets this year.  Microsoft, which initially targeted 21 countries for its\ndebut, last month cut the number to 13 to ensure larger markets\nhave sufficient supplies.  NFL Highlights  Michael Pachter , an analyst with Wedbush Securities in Los\nAngeles, expects Sony to sell 3 million consoles this year and\n12 million in 2014, compared with 2.5 million and 10 million,\nrespectively, for Microsoft.  Microsoft fell 4.6 percent to $31.88 yesterday in  New York ,\nafter announcing that it\u2019s spending 5.44 billion euros ($7.2\nbillion) to buy Nokia\u2019s devices and services unit. The shares\nhave  climbed  19 percent this year.  Xbox One is an attempt to merge television watching with\nvideo game playing, Mehdi said. Microsoft has teamed with\npartners including the  National Football League  to offer\nfeatures such as viewing highlights and game scores.  Microsoft has no plans to offer pay-TV channels in\ncompetition with established providers, nor to spin off the\nvideo-game unit, Mehdi said. Xbox One is part of a companywide\nstrategy to offer multiple devices to consumers, he said.  That strategy was underscored by the acquisition Nokia\u2019s\nhandset business. The unit accounted for more than half of the\nrevenue for the Espoo, Finland-based company, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cWe know we live in a multi-device world,\u201d Mehdi said.\n\u201cThe people between 18 and 30 -- 80 percent of them are looking\nat a phone or tablet while watching TV.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nChristopher Palmeri in  Los Angeles  at \n cpalmeri1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAnthony Palazzo at \n apalazzo@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Nokia Corporation was 4.059779167175293 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Nokia Corporation was ",
