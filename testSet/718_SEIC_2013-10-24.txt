 "context": "The following article called 'Treasury Yields at Almost 3-Month Lows on Reports of Slow Growth' was published on 2013-10-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTreasury 10-year note yields traded\nat almost a three-month low as signs of a loss of momentum in\nglobal economic growth stoked bets the  Federal Reserve  will\ndelay slowing its stimulus program until next year.  U.S. government debt  was poised for a weekly gain as more\nAmericans than forecast filed applications for jobless benefits\nlast week and the  trade deficit  was little changed in August as\nimports and exports stalled. Treasury Inflation Protected\nSecurities headed for the biggest two-month increase in more\nthan a year as a sale of $7 billion of 30-year TIPS drew strong\ndemand in the first auction since lawmakers voted to raise the\ndebt ceiling. The U.S. will sell $96 billion in notes next week.  \u201cThe Fed\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d said Larry Milstein,\nmanaging director in New York of government-debt trading at R.W.\nPressprich & Co. \u201cYou have a market that\u2019s going to be capped\nout in terms of rate. The economic data we\u2019ve seen of late is\nsoftening.\u201d  The benchmark 10-year yield rose two basis points, or 0.02\npercentage point, to 2.52 percent at 5 p.m. in  New York ,\naccording to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield dropped to\n2.47 percent yesterday, the lowest level since July 22, and has\nfallen six basis points this week. The 2.5 percent note due in\nAugust 2023 fell 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face value, to 99\n27/32.  Demand Underpinned  Demand for Treasuries may be supported by new regulations\nthat would require the biggest U.S. banks to hold enough easily\nsold assets to survive a 30-day credit drought under Fed\nliquidity rules that expand on international standards adopted\nearlier this year.  The Fed liquidity coverage ratio being considered today at\na meeting in  Washington  goes further than the Basel III measure\nadopted in January and calls for earlier implementation than the\nEuropean Union. The U.S. plan, most stringent for banks with\nmore than $250 billion in assets or substantial international\nreach, seeks implementation by 2017 -- two years ahead of\nBasel\u2019s deadline.  Treasuries returned 0.7 percent this month through\nyesterday, according to the Bloomberg  U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY) ,\ntrimming losses this year to 1.8 percent. The Bloomberg Global\nDeveloped  Sovereign Bond Index (BGSV)  gained 1.5 percent in October,\nparing its 2013 decline to 1.9 percent.  The Treasury announced today it will sell $32 billion of\ntwo-year notes on Oct. 28, $35 billion of five-year debt the\nnext day and $29 billion of seven-year securities on Oct. 30.  TIPS Auction  Today\u2019s 30-year TIPS auction drew a  bid-to-cover  ratio,\nwhich gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount\noffered, of 2.76, the highest since October 2012, versus 2.48 at\nthe June 20 auction and an average of 2.67 at the 10 previous\nauctions.  The sale drew a  yield  of 1.33 percent versus a 1.359\npercent average forecast of seven of the Fed\u2019s 21 primary\ndealers in a Bloomberg News survey. The June sale yielded 1.42\npercent.  Indirect bidders , a category of investors that includes\nforeign central banks, bought 45 percent of the securities, the\nlowest since June 2012, after buying 60.8 percent at the June\nsale and an average of 44.2 percent at the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place\ntheir bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 19.1 percent of\nthe securities, the highest since June 2012, after a record low\n0.4 percent at the June sale. The average the past 10 auctions\nwas 16 percent.  Yield \u2018Reach\u2019  \u201cThe auction went better than expected,\u201d said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury trading at BNY Mellon Capital\nMarkets in New York. \u201cThere has definitely been a reach for\nyield and a reach for the long end. There\u2019s a desire for\ninflation protection with QE in place probably for a little\nlonger than most people expected.\u201d  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and TIPS, a\ngauge of expectations for consumer prices over the life of the\nsecurities, was 2.18 percentage points. The 10-year average is\n2.22 percentage points.  TIPS have returned 2.3 percent in September and October,\npoised for the best performance since April and May of 2012,\naccording to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Demand for inflation insurance is climbing on speculation\nthe Fed will maintain asset purchases at the current level to\nsupport for the economy into 2014, increasing projections for\ngains in consumer prices.  Volatility Drops  Economists predict the Fed will maintain the current pace\nof bond purchases until March, according to a Bloomberg survey\nconducted on Oct. 17-18. The Fed today purchased $1.56 billion\nin Treasuries maturing between May 2038 and February 2043 as\npart of its program to lower borrowing costs and boost the\neconomy.  The seven-day  relative strength  index for the Treasury 10-year note yield was at 31.4 today, rising from 25.8 yesterday,\naccording to Bloomberg data. A reading lower than 30 or above 70\nsuggests the security may be poised for a change in direction.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch\nMOVE index dropped to 62.05 yesterday, the lowest level since\nMay 21. The average for the past decade is 95.06.  Jobless claims  decreased by 12,000 to 350,000 in the week\nended Oct. 19 from a revised 362,000 in the prior period, a\nLabor Department report showed today in Washington. The median\nforecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a\ndecrease to 340,000.  Global Growth  Applications in  California  remained elevated and analysts\nweren\u2019t able to determine how many non-federal workers filed due\nto the government shutdown, a Labor Department spokesman said.  The partial government shutdown this month trimmed 0.25\npercentage point from fourth-quarter economic growth and cost\nthe U.S. 120,000 jobs in October,  Jason Furman , head of the\n Council of Economic Advisers  and Obama\u2019s chief economic adviser,\nsaid this week.  Treasury  holdings  for the 21 primary dealers rose by $23.9\nbillion or 19.6 percent to a record $146 billion as of Oct. 16,\nthe day before the U.S. was expected to run out of borrowing\nauthority prior to the agreement reached that day to postpone\nthe debt ceiling through Feb. 7.  The  International Monetary Fund  this month cut its forecast\nfor global economic growth to 2.9 percent in 2013 and 3.6\npercent in 2014, from July\u2019s projected rates of 3.1 percent this\nyear and 3.8 percent next year. It also sees inflation across\nrich countries already short of the 2 percent rate favored by\nmost central banks.  U.S. payrolls rose by 148,000 in September, less than the\nforecast of 180,000 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. That\nfollowed a revised increase of 193,000 in August that was larger\nthan initially estimated, the Labor Department said Oct. 22.  The  trade deficit  increased 0.4 percent to $38.8 billion\nfrom a revised $38.6 billion in July that was smaller than\npreviously reported, the Commerce Department reported today in\nWashington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 71\neconomists called for a $39.4 billion deficit.  \u201cYou have the uncertainty of economic data approaching\nyear end -- the market is waiting to get a clear direction on\nwhich way the economy is going,\u201d said  Sean Simko , who oversees\n$8 billion at  SEI Investments Co. (SEIC)  in Oaks,  Pennsylvania . \u201cThere\nwill continue to be a bid in the marketplace; 2.40 percent is a\nreasonable target for the 10-year.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSusanne Walker in New York at \n swalker33@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Robert Burgess  at \n bburgess@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of SEI Investments Company was 29.476654052734375 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of SEI Investments Company was ",
