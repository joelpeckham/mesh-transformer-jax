 "context": "The following article called 'Europe Carriers Said to Prepare Demand for More M&A Freedom' was published on 2013-02-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEurope \u2019s  telecommunications companies  are preparing to ask the European Commission to allow more mergers within individual countries in exchange for their backing for the regulator\u2019s push to develop a regional market, according to people familiar with the matter.  The European Telecommunications Network Operators\u2019  Association , which represents 37 carriers, plans to submit a proposal to the European Union\u2019s Brussels-based executive arm in the coming weeks that outlines the need to reduce fragmentation in fixed-line and wireless markets, said the people, asking not to be identified because the plan is private.  ETNO, also based in Brussels, is of the view that three national wireless network operators and two fixed-line carriers are the maximum that domestic markets can sustain in the long term, the people said. The group is working on hiring an external consulting firm to help operators make their case, they said.  \u201cThe industry needs to strengthen itself, needs to be more concentrated, needs to be stronger,\u201d  Telecom Italia (TIT)  CEO Franco Bernabe said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Barcelona today. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of market power, it\u2019s not a question of being strong in one market. It\u2019s a question of being more solid in order to finance investments in the medium to long range.\u201d  Austrian Deal  Thierry Dieu, an ETNO spokesman, said the Brussels-based group is preparing proposals to the Commission regarding the establishment of a single European phone market. It\u2019s too early to say what the remarks will contain, he said, adding that ETNO can\u2019t make decisions on any preferred number of operators in any market.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia , declined to comment and referred to a speech Almunia made last week where he said it\u2019s \u201cobvious\u201d that markets such as mobile telephones are national and regulators were concerned that telecommunications markets are still fragmented across the 27-nation bloc.  \u201cOur examination of mergers in this sector takes on particular importance,\u201d he said in the speech. \u201cWe must ensure that the market structure emerging from mergers that we check remain competitive.\u201d  Stocks Decline  The region\u2019s carriers are stepping up efforts to limit competition as service revenue declines, putting pressure on their profitability and stock prices. Antitrust authorities last year opposed  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) \u2019s plan to merge its Greek business with a local rival.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) \u2019s 1.3 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) purchase of Orange in  Austria  was approved only after the Hong Kong-based company agreed to give up wireless frequencies in the country.  \u201cThe internationalization of our industry in Europe stopped five or six years ago,\u201d Vodafone CEO said at the  Mobile World Congress  today. \u201cMost of it is really policies.\u201d  Telecommunications stocks were the worst performers last year, with the Stoxx 600 Telecommunications Index down 11 percent.  Royal KPN NV (KPN)  and  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  attracted  Carlos Slim \u2019s  America Movil (AMXL)  SAB to acquire stakes in 2012. The two carriers, along with  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , are the three worst performers this year through Feb. 22, with KPN down 24 percent, Telecom Italia having lost 13 percent and  Telekom Austria  off 12 percent.  Cross-Border Mergers  Telecom Italia rose 3 percent to 61 cents at 4:06 p.m. in Milan.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  gained 2.5 percent to 8.36 euros in  Frankfurt . KPN fell 1.6 percent in Amsterdam and Telekom Austria climbed 0.3 percent in Vienna.  Neelie Kroes, the European Commissioner in charge of the digital agenda, said last year that cross-border mergers would be beneficial for the region\u2019s telecommunications market.  In a speech last month, Kroes said \u201cthe telecoms single market needs to be more than just rhetoric,\u201d as she unveiled a 10-step plan to further integrate Europe\u2019s phone market in a bid to boost adoption of broadband Internet.  The European Commission wants  Internet providers  to offer download speeds of at least 30 megabits per second by 2020, with half of homes exceeding 100 megabits per second, fast enough to to transfer a high-resolution movie in a minute. The project costs 270 billion euros ($357 billion), Kroes has estimated.  German Fiber  Carriers can\u2019t afford to reach that goal using fiber alone. Deutsche Telekom has estimated a complete fiber rollout in  Germany  would cost 60 billion euros to 80 billion euros, but the company budgets less than 10 billion euros a year for investment, including its mobile and international networks. The French government says it would cost 25 billion euros to build a nationwide fiber network -- 10 times the domestic spending of  France Telecom .  There will probably be more in-country consolidation in Europe, Claudia Nemat, Deutsche Telekom\u2019s head of Europe, told reporters in Barcelona today. \u201cIn all countries, regulators have a tendency to keep the number of operators at around three to four, so we need to find a balance,\u201d she said.  Phone companies also need to spend billions of dollar to expand wireless networks and pay for airwaves. The U.K. government last week raised 2.34 billion pounds ($3.5 billion) from a sale of faster fourth-generation mobile spectrum.  Such spending has made it more difficult for carriers to reduce debt and find cash to finance acquisitions.  Telefonica SA (TEF) ,  Spain \u2019s biggest phone company, for example, is among carriers that has sold assets to protect its debt ratings.  \u201cWe are squeezed by regulators while other players of the value chain aren\u2019t constrained,\u201d Telefonica CEO Cesar Alierta said today in Barcelona. \u201cChanges in regulation need to be taken much, much faster. The industry needs a more level playing field.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story: Cornelius Rahn in Barcelona at  crahn2@bloomberg.net ; Manuel Baigorri in Barcelona at  mbaigorri@bloomberg.net ; Amy Thomson in Barcelona at  athomson6@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Kenneth Wong  at  kwong11@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Vodafone Group Plc was 15.26047420501709 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Vodafone Group Plc was ",
