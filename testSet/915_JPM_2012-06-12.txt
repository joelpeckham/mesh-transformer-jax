 "context": "The following article called 'Senate Democrats Seek More Money for Dodd-Frank Agencies' was published on 2012-06-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S.  Senate Democrats  are seeking to\nincrease the budget of the main financial-markets regulators in\nspending plans that clash with House Republicans\u2019 efforts to cut\nfunds and rein in the Dodd-Frank Act.  The  Commodity Futures Trading Commission \u2019s fiscal 2013\nbudget would be increased to $308 million, 50 percent above its\ncurrent level, as part of a broader spending plan approved\nyesterday by the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on financial\nservices.  The panel also proposed a 19 percent increase in the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\u2019s budget, creating a rift\nbetween the Democrat-led Senate and the Republican-run House,\nwhich has proposed cutting the commodities regulator\u2019s funding,\nwhile giving a smaller bump to the SEC.  \u201cThe passage of the Wall Street reform bill expands\nresponsibilities and important roles for the SEC and CFTC, and\nthis bill provides the funding to continue this much needed\nreform,\u201d Senator  Dick Durbin , an Illinois Democrat and chairman\nof the Senate subcommittee, said in remarks prepared for the\nmeeting yesterday.  The two chambers will need to pass spending measures and\nreconcile their differences before a complete bill can be sent\nto President  Barack Obama  for signature. A Republican-led House\npanel last week voted to cut the CFTC\u2019s budget by $25 million,\nciting concerns about regulatory overreach and failures during\nthe collapse of  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ)   The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s budget would\nincrease $245 million to $1.6 billion under the Senate measure.  Dodd-Frank \u2018Overreach\u2019  \u201cThe concern we have is the overreach of Dodd-Frank,\u201d\nRepresentative Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican and chairman\nof the House agriculture panel, said on June 6. The CFTC also\nwas \u201casleep on the job\u201d before MF Global collapsed last year,\nleaving a shortfall of $1.6 billion in customer funds.  Democrats have criticized Republicans for proposed cuts in\nthe CFTC\u2019s budget and a plan to put the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau under congressional appropriations scrutiny\neach year instead of its current system of transfers from the\n Federal Reserve . Democrats have argued that  JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (JPM) \u2019s May 10 announcement of at least $2 billion in derivatives\ntrading losses demonstrates the need for increased funding for\nfinancial regulators.  The House measure is \u201ca declaration of unilateral\nsurrender to the forces of irresponsibility that wrecked our\neconomy several years ago,\u201d Representative  Barney Frank , a\nMassachusetts Democrat and co-author of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act,\nsaid last week.  \u2018Sufficient Cops\u2019  At the Senate measure\u2019s funding level, \u201cthe CFTC will have\nsufficient cops on the beat to promote swap market transparency,\nto lower risk to the financial system, and to help protect the\nAmerican people from future bailouts of the financial\nindustry,\u201d  Gary Gensler , CFTC chairman, said in a statement\nyesterday.  Under Durbin\u2019s bill, the  Internal Revenue Service  would get\n$12.5 billion, or a 6 percent increase over the $11.8 billion it\nreceived this year. That\u2019s still shy of the $12.8 billion that\nthe administration recommended.  The House version of the bill would deny the IRS any\nincrease this year. Douglas Shulman, the commissioner of the\nIRS, has said that significant budget cuts at the IRS would cost\nthe government money because the agency wouldn\u2019t be able to\ncollect as much  tax revenue .
