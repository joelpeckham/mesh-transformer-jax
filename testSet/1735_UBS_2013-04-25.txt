The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  European Central Bank  said the\nreduction of borrowing costs to a historic low has mainly helped\nfinancial institutions in more stable countries.  \u201cThe competition for higher yields triggered by the low\ninterest-rate environment appears to have benefited mainly\ncounterparties and financial instruments with relatively high\nratings, located in countries relatively immune from market\ntensions,\u201d the ECB said in its annual financial integration\nreport published today.  The Frankfurt-based ECB in July lowered its  benchmark rate \nto 0.75 percent and in September presented details of an\nunlimited bond-buying plan, dubbed Outright Monetary\nTransactions. Banks including Nomura International Plc, UBS AG\nand  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  forecast the ECB will cut\nrates next week after policy makers hinted that they\u2019d reduce\nborrowing costs in response to disappointing economic data.  Another interest-rate cut would only have a limited effect\non countries in the periphery, ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen said in  London  today. \u201c Interest rates  that are too low\nfor too long can eventually lead to distortions.\u201d  While decisions by European leaders to set up a banking\nunion and the ECB\u2019s non-standard measures have helped restore\nconfidence in financial markets, \u201cthe recovery of banking\nmarkets is proving to be slower and less vigorous than that of\nother market segments,\u201d the ECB said.  ECB officials are scheduled to meet in Bratislava on May 2\nfor their monthly policy meeting.
