 "context": "The following article called 'BCE Amends Takeover Bid for Astral After Proposal Blocked' was published on 2012-11-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBCE Inc. (BCE) ,  Canada \u2019s largest\ntelecommunications company, amended its takeover plan for  Astral\nMedia Inc. (ACM/A)  after the initial proposal was blocked by regulators\nin October amid concerns it would harm competition.  The new proposal keeps the amount payable to Astral\nshareholders the same, the companies said in a statement.\nHolders of Class A and B shares will receive cash or a\ncombination of cash and as much C$750 million of BCE common\nshares, or C$50 and C$54.83 a share, respectively. The C$3.38\nbillion ($3.39 billion) deal must be approved by Canada\u2019s\nbroadcast and antitrust regulators.  Under the amendments, BCE\u2019s regulatory covenants have been\nmodified to include viewership share criteria and an outline of\ntangible benefits to consumers. The renewed effort to make the\ndeal happen underscores the desire both companies have to add\nscale, said Gavin Graham, president of  Graham Investment\nStrategy , a Toronto-based investment consulting firm that\nadvises clients such as mutual funds.  \u201cEven with Astral\u2019s French-language assets, BCE will still\nbe No. 2 to Quebecor by a long way,\u201d Graham said in an\ninterview, referring to the Montreal-based owner of  Quebec \u2019s TVA\ntelevision network and Videotron cable company. \u201cThis may be\none of the reasons why BCE agreed to do this revised deal.\u201d  French Market  The Ottawa-based regulator said on Oct. 18 that the deal\nraised concerns about competition, ownership concentration in\ntelevision and radio, and the exercise of market power, with the\ntwo sides differing in how they calculated market share.  The deal would have given BCE a 42.7 percent share of the\nCanadian English-language television market and 33.1 percent of\nthe French-language market, the CRTC said.  BCE today said its resubmitted offer \u201caddresses the\ncommission\u2019s concerns and sets out the steps the companies would\ntake to comply with the relevant viewership thresholds,\u201d\naccording to the statement.  The new proposal for Astral, a broadcaster and owner of\nbillboards, includes viewership of media properties jointly\nowned with other companies in its calculation of market share,\nwhile excluding viewership of U.S. channels.  Cash Dividend  \u201cThey are doing the right thing to submit, they had a good\ncase the first time around,\u201d said Charles Boyer, a Montreal-\nbased telecommunications consultant and former vice-president of\nthe Canadian Association of Broadcasting.  Astral\u2019s board of directors has also declared a cash\ndividend of 50 Canadian cents a share to holders of record at\nthe close on Jan. 15.  Astral rose 3.1 percent to close at C$45.78, and BCE was\nlittle changed at C$42.01 today.  Both companies agreed to extend the so-called outside date,\nthe deadline for the takeover to be completed, until June 1. The\nprevious extension was set to expire Dec. 16. BCE and Astral\neach has the right to further postpone the deadline until July\n31.  In the initial March 16 plan, BCE agreed to pay C$50 a\nshare for Astral, a 38 percent premium over the previous day\u2019s\nclosing price. That exceeded the 26 percent average premium paid\nby media companies globally in the last five years, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. Astral  soared  34 percent on the day\nthe transaction was announced.  Bad Deal  Last month\u2019s rejection marked the first major decision by\nJean-Pierre Blais, the new head of the Canadian Radio-television\nand Telecommunications Commission, who claimed the BCE-Astral\ntransaction wouldn\u2019t be a good deal for Canadians.  BCE, the owner of the CTV television network, lacked French\ncontent other than French sports channel RDS. Adding Astral\nwould bolster that content, Vice Chairman Martine Turcotte said\nin March.  Some of the assets BCE may have to give up include the half\nshare of Teletoon, and the Family Channel, which they share with\n Corus Entertainment Inc. (CJR/B) , said Graham. And Rogers may pick up\nsome English-language networks, he said.  \u201cSo it\u2019s not quite as good a deal for BCE, but two-thirds\nor three-quarters of a loaf is better than none,\u201d said Graham.
