The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPayments from the German government\nrewarding hard coal and natural gas-fed power plants for\noperating during hours of high demand or low renewables output\nare inevitable by 2017, according to Swiss bank  UBS AG. (UBSN)   An increasing number of gas and hard coal plants will no\nlonger be able to recover operating costs by producing and\nselling electricity at market rates as prices and operating\nhours shrink, Patrick Hummel, an analyst at UBS, said in an e-\nmailed report dated today.  Germany gives priority grid access to renewable energy and\na surge in supplies has pushed down electricity prices and the\nnumber of hours thermal generation is needed to meet demand. The\nplant payment system would create a so-called capacity market\nthat would allow utilities to fix prices for guaranteeing backup\npower supply in advance.  \u201cPolitics and the regulator have to create an additional\nsource of income, which remunerates the availability of the\nplant rather than the actual output,\u201d Hummel said.  The  German next-month clean-spark spread , a measure of the\nprofit utilities can get from selling electricity after\naccounting for the cost of natural gas and emissions permits,\nfell 1.5 percent to minus 21.45 euros (minus $27.87) a megawatt-\nhour today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure\nhas been negative since February 2012.  Capacity payments would stabilize profits of hard coal and\ngas plants just above break-even level, rather than creating\n\u201cmeaningful profitability,\u201d Hummel said. Widespread closures\naren\u2019t a viable option because of security-of-supply concerns,\nhe said.  Shutdown Warning  Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government is considering a\nmandate for power-station operators to inform authorities of a\nshutdown one year in advance and may block plans in return for\ncompensation payments.  A capacity market in  Germany  may cost 1 billion euros a\nyear in 2017 and cut current forward electricity prices by 10\npercent, Hummel said. German 2014 power declined as much as 0.9\npercent to 38.85 euros a megawatt-hour today, according to\nbroker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lignite, nuclear and hydro plants do not need capacity\nremuneration until power prices fall below 30 euros a megawatt-\nhour, Hummel said.
