 "context": "The following article called 'Euro Falls Against Dollar for Second Day on Renewed Sovereign-Debt Concern' was published on 2010-07-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe euro fell against the dollar for\na second consecutive day on speculation tests to demonstrate the\nresilience of the region\u2019s banking system will fall short of\nassuring investors.  \n The dollar rose against most of its major counterparts on\nrenewed demand for the greenback as a refuge. Financial\nministers meet in Brussels today to discuss how much detail to\ndisclose as regulators examine the ability of 91 European banks\nto withstand losses on sovereign-debt holdings.  \n \u201cThere is renewed uncertainty about the European stress\ntests,\u201d said  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in Washington at\nTravelex Global Business Payments, a currency-exchange network.\n\u201cThat\u2019s depressing market sentiment. We\u2019ve seen more of a\ncautious tone.\u201d  \n The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.2573 at 8:38 a.m. in New\nYork, from $1.2641 on July 9, when it touched $1.2722, the\nhighest level since May 12. The euro slipped 0.6 percent to\n111.39 yen, from 112.01. The dollar was little changed at 88.60\nyen, compared with 88.62.  \n The euro was also driven lower as  Der Spiegel  said a German\nplan to allow the \u201corderly insolvency\u201d of countries would\nforce bondholders to give up part of their claims. The proposal\ndrafted by the German Finance and Justice ministries calls for a\n\u201cBerlin Club\u201d of nations to oversee insolvencies.  \n Holders of sovereign bonds, while taking a so-called\nhaircut, would be guaranteed half the bond\u2019s face value as an\nincentive to take part in debt restructuring, said Der Spiegel,\nwithout saying where it got the information.  \n Stress Tests  \n The banks being tested account for 65 percent of Europe\u2019s\nbanking industry. They include Deutsche Bank AG of Germany,\nFrance\u2019s BNP Paribas SA and ING Groep NV of the Netherlands,\naccording to the Committee of European Banking Supervisors,\nwhich is organizing the tests. The results are due to be\npublished July 23.  \n The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and\nother large speculators on a decline in the euro compared with\nthose on a gain dropped to 38,909 on July 6, compared with\nrecord net shorts of 113,890 on May 11, figures from the\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission showed on July 9.  \n \u201cA lot of the oversold positions in the euro are now\ngone,\u201d said  Greg Gibbs , a foreign-exchange strategist at Royal\nBank of Scotland Group Plc in Sydney. \u201cThe euro will be\nvulnerable to negative news.\u201d  \n Boon to Companies  \n Executives from Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Volkswagen\nAG\u2019s Audi unit and Siemens AG credit the currency\u2019s decline from\nits 16-month high of $1.5144 in November for boosting\ncompetitiveness and making revenue earned overseas worth more\nwhen they bring it home.  \n Dissolving the euro would save the 16-nation region from\nyears of stagnation by boosting weaker members\u2019 competitiveness\nas well as domestic demand in Germany, Capital Economics said.  \n \u201cThe threatened breakup of the euro zone, which many see\nas a potential disaster, would actually open the door to renewed\neconomic growth, not just for weaker members of the zone, but\nfor Europe as a whole,\u201d Capital Economics analysts including\n Roger Bootle  in London said in a report released yesterday.  \n The yen dropped earlier against the dollar after Japan\u2019s\nPrime Minister  Naoto Kan \u2019s party lost control of the upper house\nof parliament, potentially slowing efforts to rein in the\nworld\u2019s largest  public debt .  \n Outlook for Kan  \n Standard & Poor\u2019s said  Kan \u2019s defeat is \u201cpotentially\nnegative\u201d for Japan\u2019s debt rating because of legislative\ngridlock. Results compiled by the broadcaster NHK showed the\nruling  Democratic Party of Japan  won 44 upper-house seats in\nyesterday\u2019s election, compared with 51 for the opposition\n Liberal Democratic Party . Half the 242 seats in the less\npowerful of Japan\u2019s two houses of parliament were contested.  \n \u201cIt will be difficult for the government to push through\nthe necessary reforms and restructuring in the public sector and\nthe taxation system,\u201d  Takahira Ogawa , director of sovereign\nratings at S&P in Singapore, said in a phone interview today.  \n Ogawa said he will watch whether the DPJ\u2019s top officials\nmight change, including Kan, who is up for re-election as party\npresident in September. Kan said he doesn\u2019t plan to step down.  \n Kan, who took office a month ago, stoked voter resentment\nby calling for a debate on whether to raise the 5 percent sales\ntax, drawing attention to a national debt that amounts to\n$80,000 per person.  \n \u201cIn the short term investors are reacting to the political\nsituation,\u201d said  Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist at\nBank of New York Mellon Corp. in London. \u201cIf the second half of\nthe year turns out to be a tough one, the yen will strengthen.\u201d  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Catarina Saraiva  in New York at \n asaraiva5@bloomberg.net ;\n Matthew Brown  in London at \n mbrown42@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Naoto Kan, Japan's prime minister and president of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), speaks during a news conference at the party's election center in Tokyo.
