The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\nrenewed its bid to draw Bruno Iksil, known as the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d\ntrader, into an $8.6 billion fight with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)   The defunct investment bank filed a revised request\nyesterday to a federal judge in  Manhattan , seeking permission to\nask for international judicial assistance to force Iksil, a\nFrench national, to answer questions, as he is unwilling to do\nso.

Lehman\u2019s inquiry concerned fewer than a dozen derivatives\ntrades, out of 70,000 such trades between the bank and its\nclient, and would add nothing to the \u201cmillions of pages of\ndocuments and eighty depositions of current and former JPMorgan\npersonnel\u201d obtained by Lehman in the past two years, JPMorgan\nsaid in filings in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan.
