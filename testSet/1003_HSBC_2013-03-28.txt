The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  France \u2019s largest\nbank, is conducting a review of \u201ca significant volume\u201d of U.S.\ndollar transactions with countries that may face American\neconomic sanctions.  The review covers \u201ccertain U.S. dollar payments involving\ncountries, persons and entities that could be subject to\neconomic sanctions under U.S. law,\u201d the Paris-based bank said\nin its  annual report . The transactions may be \u201cimpermissible\u201d\nunder regulations such as those of the Office of Foreign Assets\nControl, BNP Paribas said.  Global regulators last month called on banks to reinforce\nrisk management and oversight in response to recent scandals\nthat have eroded confidence in the financial system. A Feb. 12\nstudy on lenders by the Financial Stability Board found that\n\u201csignificant gaps\u201d persist in risk management.  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , France\u2019s second-largest bank, said\nearlier this month that it has started discussions with OFAC and\nbegun an internal audit of dollar transfers for clients in\ncountries targeted by U.S. sanctions. London-based HSBC Holdings\nPlc and Standard Chartered Plc paid fines in the U.S. over\nfailures to halt the laundering of money in sanctioned countries\nsuch as  Iran .  BNP Paribas currently cannot assess \u201cthe specific amount\nor even the general magnitude\u201d of the review\u2019s possible impact\non its results and financial situation, it said, without giving\nfurther details of the transactions.  \u201cWhen the bank completes this review, it will present its\nfindings and arguments to the U.S. authorities,\u201d BNP Paribas\nsaid. The timing to complete the review and \u201csubsequent\ndiscussions with the U.S. authorities is also uncertain,\u201d BNP\nParibas said.
