 "context": "The following article called 'JPMorgan, Pforzheim Urged to Settle $71 Million Swap Suit' was published on 2012-01-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and the German\ncity of Pforzheim should settle a dispute over 56 million euros\n($71 million) in losses on an interest-rate swap, a judge said.  The city should accept one-third of the amount, Presiding\nJudge Daniel Koehler told the parties at a hearing in Frankfurt\ntoday. While the city may win the case if it can prove that it\nwasn\u2019t properly informed about the initial market value of the\nderivative, this isn\u2019t guaranteed and proceedings may drag on\nfor a long time, he said.  \u201cA settlement would pour money in the city\u2019s coffers right\naway,\u201d Koehler said. \u201cThe amounts at stake aren\u2019t peanuts and\nboth sides face considerable risks in this case.\u201d  The city of Pforzheim is among several European\nmunicipalities that lost millions of euros on derivative\ntransactions that went sour. After  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany \u2019s\nbiggest bank, lost a case over interest-rate swaps at Germany\u2019s\nhighest civil court last year, cities and small companies are\ntrying to recover their losses in court.  Lawyers for the city said the settlement amount proposed by\nthe judge wouldn\u2019t be acceptable and that the city council must\nconsider the issue. JPMorgan\u2019s lawyer said he will discuss the\nproposal with his client. The court scheduled a ruling for March\n23.  Deutsche Bank Mirror  Pforzheim bought the swap to mirror a derivative it had\nacquired from Deutsche Bank that accumulated 20 million euros of\nlosses. Over time, the Deutsche Bank transaction turned\npositive, while the swap from JPMorgan incurred about 60 million\neuros in losses.  Under most interest-rate swap agreements sold to utilities,\nmedium-size companies and cities, the lender paid a fixed rate\nand the customer an amount based on Euribor rates.  The top court\u2019s reasoning in the Deutsche Bank ruling would\napply in this case, so JPMorgan had a duty to disclose any\nnegative market value, Judge Koehler said. While the city had\nexperience with swaps and the negotiations were handled by two\nwomen with some knowledge in the area, that didn\u2019t exclude the\nbank\u2019s duty to advise its customer, he said. The court\u2019s\nassessment is preliminary, the judge added.  \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much like in the top court case, there was\nalso a person with some economic education on the customer\nside,\u201d Koehler said. \u201cOur top court tends to increase the\nconsumer-like protection it grants cities and small business.\u201d  Pforzheim claims it didn\u2019t know the negative market value\nwas 23 million euros instead of 20 million euros. JPMorgan\nlawyer Carsten van de Sande told the court the bank always made\nclear its profit margin and structuring cost for the instrument\nwere priced into the swap.  \u201cYou can\u2019 take a chance without any risk,\u201d said van de\nSande. \u201cPforzheim could also have decided to simply pay back\nthe 20 millon euros to Deutsche Bank at the time and not buy the\nswap from JPMorgan.\u201d  Today\u2019s case is LG  Frankfurt , 2-25 O 669/10.
