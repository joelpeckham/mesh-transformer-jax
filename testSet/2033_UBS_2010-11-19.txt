 "context": "The following article called 'Queensland Said to Price QR National IPO Near Bottom of Indicated Range' was published on 2010-11-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nQueensland state may sell shares of\nAustralian coal-train operator  QR National Ltd.  near the bottom\nof an indicated price range in its initial public offering, said\nthree people familiar with the matter.  The stock, due to start trading in Sydney on Nov. 22, will\nprobably be sold to institutions for between A$2.55 and A$2.60\neach, the people said, declining to be identified because the\npricing discussions are private. The state government said Oct.\n11 it would sell the shares at between A$2.50 and A$3 apiece to\nraise as much as A$5.05 billion ($5 billion).  Queensland is targeting A$15 billion from asset sales to\nreplace lost revenue and regain its AAA credit rating. QR\nNational, set to be Australia\u2019s largest IPO since 1997, will\ntest the appetite for new listings after Valemus Ltd. scrapped a\nA$1.39 billion offer in July and shares of  Myer Holdings Ltd. ,\nwhich raised A$2.1 billion in 2009, trade below the offer price.  \u201cIt reflects the market is more cautious than it might\nhave been,\u201d said  Sandy Grant , who manages about A$140 million\nat Wilson HTM Investment Group in Brisbane and bid for QR\nNational stock. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good asset in the long run for\npeople who are careful enough to take a five-year view.\u201d  Queensland Treasurer  Andrew Fraser  will announce the final\nprice tomorrow at 12 p.m. Brisbane time, according to an\ninvitation to the media conference. His office declined to\ncomment today. Fraser has said the state will retain between 25\npercent and 40 percent of QR National until at least 2012. The\nAustralian Financial Review reported today the stock would fetch\nabout A$2.55 each in the IPO and the government would keep a 40\npercent stake.  More Expensive  If the government keeps a 40 percent stake and sells the\nstock at A$2.60 apiece, the IPO will raise as much as A$3.8\nbillion. The proceeds may be less, depending on how much stock\nis taken by retail investors, who get a 10-cent discount on the\ninstitutional price.  Queensland is relying on rising demand for commodities in\nChina and India to lure investors to the IPO. Even at the bottom\nof the indicative range, QR National shares would be more\nexpensive than those of  Asciano Group , Australia\u2019s biggest\nlisted port and rail operator.  Based on the A$2.50 to A$3 per share price range, QR\nNational would trade at 21 times to 25 times estimated earnings\nper share for the year ending June 2011, according to the IPO\nsale document. Asciano  trades  at 19 times estimated earnings for\nthe 12 months ending June 2011, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg.  16,000 Wagons  QR National  operates  700 locomotives, 16,000 wagons and\n2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles) of track across Australia,\naccording to a share sale document. Brisbane-based QR National\nexpects earnings to surge 75 percent in the next two years as\ncoal shipments rise and mining companies expand projects in\nWestern Australia state.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and\namortization are set to increase 42 percent to A$894 million in\nthe 12 months ending June 2011, the company said in the IPO\nprospectus on Oct. 11. Earnings may rise 23 percent in the\nfollowing year, the document showed.  Bank of America Corp.\u2019s Merrill Lynch & Co. unit, Credit\nSuisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty, Royal\nBank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG are managing the QR\nNational offering.  Credit Rating Cut  QR National is the third of five assets the state is\nselling after Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service\nboth removed Queensland from the top credit rating in 2009.  The government last week sold the Port of Brisbane,\nAustralia\u2019s third-biggest container harbor, to a group led by\n Global Infrastructure Partners  and Abu Dhabi Investment\nAuthority for A$2.1 billion. In June, it completed the sale of a\n99-year lease to forest plantations for A$603 million.  The state has sent out requests for expressions of interest\nin the  Abbot Point coal terminal  and is working to complete the\nsale of a toll-road company by June, Treasurer Fraser said in a\nNov. 11 telephone interview.  No further sales are planned once the residual QR stake is\nsold, he said.
