 "context": "The following article called 'Tesla\u2019s Musk Predicts 25% Model S Output Gain After Snag' was published on 2013-02-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) , the maker of electric cars headed by billionaire Elon Musk, plans to increase output by at least 25 percent this year after earnings were hurt by startup snags that drove up costs in 2012.  The company\u2019s shares fell the most in almost five months after it posted a quarterly loss that missed analyst estimates.  Production of the rechargeable sedan at Tesla\u2019s Fremont,  California , plant will probably reach 500 a week in mid-2013 after climbing to 400 a week in December, Musk said in a phone interview yesterday. The company will hold off on increasing output until it smoothens out the high amounts of overtime and delays in parts shipments it faced in 2012, he said.  The carmaker, named after inventor  Nikola Tesla , reiterated a goal of delivering 20,000 of its lithium-ion battery-powered sedans this year, after falling short of an initial target of 5,000 in 2012. Tesla is counting on demand for the car, priced from about $60,000, to help it turn profitable as early as this quarter, with growth accelerating when the Model X crossover vehicle is added in 2014.  The shares fell 8.8 percent to $35.16 at the close in  New York , the biggest one-day drop since Sept. 25.  \u201cI want to keep the company on a steady production pace and focus on efficiency,\u201d said Musk, 41, Tesla\u2019s chief executive officer and biggest shareholder. \u201cWe need to level off and focus on running a real tight ship.\u201d  Production at its Fremont factory may increase beyond 500 a week toward the end of the year if there\u2019s demand, he said.  Quarterly Loss  The  Palo Alto , California-company reported a fourth-quarter loss that was larger than analysts anticipated yesterday after the markets closed, blaming a jump in operating costs during the start of production.  Operating expenses rose 29 percent to $114.7 million in the quarter because of higher logistics costs and component prices, the company said.  John Lovallo, an analyst for BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, today lowered his rating on Tesla to underperform from neutral, following the company\u2019s results.  Musk said the share price drop in extended trading yesterday was due to a misconception about demand for the Model S.  \u201cIf we were to close all of our stores today, we\u2019d be sold out basically for the whole year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got reservations for roughly 15,000 cars, over and above what we\u2019ve already delivered.\u201d  Shipments of Model S to  Europe  start in the third quarter this year, and to  Japan  and  Hong Kong  in the final months of 2013, the company said yesterday. Tesla is also preparing to sell the car to drivers in  China , said George Blankenship, vice president of sales.  Beijing Outlet  \u201cWe\u2019re under construction on a store in Beijing that will open in the spring,\u201d Blankenship said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one of the larger stores, with respect to the China market size.\u201d  With the addition of those markets and higher production, deliveries may increase 50 percent in 2014 from this year, Musk said.  \u201cI think 30,000 units in 2014 is a pretty reasonable target,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s with a little bit of X in the mix.\u201d  The fourth-quarter  net loss  widened to $89.9 million, from $81.5 million a year ago, Tesla reported yesterday. Excluding some items, the loss was 65 cents a share, compared with 69 cents a share a year ago. Analysts on average  estimated  a loss of 57 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tesla now expects to  post  a profit excluding certain items in the first quarter, as sales of the sedan expand. Analysts on average had projected an adjusted loss of 23 cents a share in the first quarter.  Turning Profitable  \u201cOur focus in the first quarter is making sure we\u2019re profitable as promised,\u201d Musk said. After that, \u201cwe\u2019re certainly going to try to be profitable every quarter.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s  Model S , with a base price of $59,900 before a $7,500 U.S. tax credit, travels as far as 300 miles (483 kilometers) with a full charge, according to the company. The U.S. has certified Model S range of being between 208 miles and 265 miles, based on battery size.  Sales in the fourth quarter jumped more than seven-fold to $306.3 million, from a year earlier, in line with the average analyst estimate of $306.1 million. The company delivered a total of 2,650 vehicles to customers last year, including 2,400 in the fourth quarter. The delivery goal this quarter is 4,500.  Operating expenses rose because of \u201csignificant early- stage cost inefficiencies,\u201d including higher logistics costs and component prices, the company said. Those costs will drop \u201csubstantially\u201d this quarter, Tesla said.  Overtime Expenses  High amounts of overtime, with employees in Fremont working about 70 hours a week in late 2012, use of additional temporary workers, and costs to have tires and other parts delivered via airfreight led expenses to jump, Musk said.  \u201cMost of the nightmares happened in the fourth quarter,\u201d he said. Currently, plant employees are working about 50 hours a week, \u201cand we want to get to more like a 45-hour week,\u201d Musk said.  The company expects to be near break even on  cash flow  from operations in the current quarter.  \u201cIdeally, cost problems they might have had during the launch are mostly behind them,\u201d said Alan Baum, principal of Baum & Associates consulting firm in West Bloomfield,  Michigan . \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, and it seems to be, it allows them to have a more positive cash flow situation earlier than planned.\u201d  Tesla counts  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  as both customers and investors, supplying each with battery packs and motors.  Tesla rose 14 percent this year before today, after gaining 19 percent last year. The stock outperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\u2019s gains of 6 percent and 13 percent respectively in the periods.
