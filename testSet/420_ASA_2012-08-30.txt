The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTotal SA (FP)  and GDF Suez said it\u2019s too\nearly to decide whether to expand a liquefied natural gas plant\nthat processes output from their Snohvit field in the  Barents\nSea , the option preferred by operator  Statoil ASA. (STL)   \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Martin Tiffen, head of Total\u2019s\nNorway unit, said today in Stavanger. \u201cIt\u2019s an option.\u201d  Expanding the Hammerfest plant would be the \u201cbest solution\neconomically,\u201d rather than building a southbound pipeline, if\nthe partners decide to double output at Snohvit, the first field\ndeveloped in the Arctic Barents Sea, Statoil said in July.  \u201cNeither, today, is like a slam dunk from an economical\npoint of view,\u201d Tiffen said in an interview. \u201cIt could be\nboth. But these things take time.\u201d  Statoil, Norway\u2019s largest oil and gas producer, in April\nsaid it may increase Snohvit output to deplete reserves and free\nup capacity as it prepares to develop other Arctic discoveries.  \u201c GDF Suez (GSZ)  thinks that several issues and alternative\nsolutions still need to be studied and agreed before we can\nrecommend how to best complete the development of Snohvit,\u201d Ulf\nRosenberg, a spokesman for GDF, said in an e-mailed statement.  Statoil has 36.8 percent of Snohvit, Petoro AS 30 percent,\nTotal 18.4 percent, GDF 12 percent and RWE-DEA AG 2.8 percent.
