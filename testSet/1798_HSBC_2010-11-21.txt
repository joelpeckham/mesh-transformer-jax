 "context": "The following article called 'Hong Kong Property Sales Slide 83% as Higher Tax Deters Weekend Homebuyers' was published on 2010-11-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBusinessman William Yue was close to\nbuying an apartment worth about HK$11 million ($1.4 million) in\nHong Kong\u2019s Kowloon Tong district. He may not be able to afford\nthat after the government imposed additional taxes and raised\ndown-payments to curb prices that have surged to a 13-year high.  Financial Secretary  John Tsang  on Nov. 19 announced some of\nthe toughest measures yet in a yearlong battle to rein in home\nvalues that  soared  more than 50 percent since the beginning of\n2009, sparking outcries that housing was becoming unaffordable\nand prompting the International Monetary Fund to warn last week\nthat asset inflation may derail the city\u2019s  economy .  \u201cThe down payment we need to pay would probably be a bit\nout of our budget,\u201d 58-year-old Yue said yesterday. \u201cImposing\nthe extra stamp duty should\u2019ve been enough to curb speculation.\nAll this does is hurt real users like us.\u201d  Weekend sales of used homes fell 83 percent from the\nprevious week, according to data from  Centaline Property Agency\nLtd.  Homes sold within six months of purchase incur a 15 percent\nstamp duty from Nov. 20, and down payments will rise to 50\npercent for properties costing HK$12 million or more, and to 40\npercent for those between HK$8 million and HK$12 million.  \u201cThe measures will likely have the biggest and most\nlasting impact on property prices seen to date,\u201d  Donna Kwok , a\nHong Kong-based economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a report.\n\u201cHong Kong has jumped onto the bandwagon of Asian central banks\nand is erecting its own defenses to fend off the flood\u201d of\ncapital from the U.S. easing.  Hong Kong\u2019s currency peg to the dollar prevents its de-\nfacto central bank from raising interest rates. South Korea\nrevived a tax on foreigners investing in its bonds last week,\nwhile Brazil tripled a tax on purchases of local fixed-income\nassets by overseas investors.  Transactions Plunge  The  Hang Seng Property Index , which tracks the city\u2019s\nseven-biggest builders, fell for the eighth day in nine Nov. 19,\nlosing 1.3 percent to the  lowest  since Oct. 29. It has declined\n7.6 percent since this year\u2019s peak on Nov. 8.  \u201cProperty stocks will probably fall, but I don\u2019t think the\ndeclines will be too severe, as there is still ample liquidity\nin the stock market,\u201d said  Ben Kwong , chief operating officer\nat brokerage KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.  The number of transactions at some of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest\nprivate housing estates fell to 10 on Nov. 20 and 21, Centaline,\nthe city\u2019s biggest privately held real-estate broker, said in a\nstatement yesterday. There were 59 deals the previous weekend.  \u201cWe\u2019re expecting transactions to drop between 10 and 20\npercent for this quarter and prices will probably go down by\nabout 5 percent at least,\u201d said  Wong Leung-sing , associate\ndirector of research at Centaline.  Housing Estates  Centaline had only one transaction on Nov. 20 at the\n12,700-unit Tai Koo Shing housing estate on Hong Kong Island,\nfrom six the previous week, District Manager Kenneth Chiu said\nyesterday. The number of appointments for viewings at the estate\nused by real-estate agents as a barometer of sentiment dropped\nby about 30 percent from last week, Chiu said.  There were no transactions on Nov. 20 in Mei Foo Sun Chuen,\na 99-tower private housing estate in Kowloon, from eight the\nprevious week, said District Manager Elvia Chan.  \u201cMost of the buyers we\u2019ve been speaking to said they\nexpect prices to drop further so they\u2019ll hold off from making a\ndecision for now,\u201d Chiu said. \u201cOn the other hand, sellers on\naverage are willing to bring down asking prices by about 2 to 5\npercent.\u201d  Home prices surged 52 percent since the beginning of 2009,\naccording to an index compiled by Centaline.  Stamp Duties, Down Payments  Properties resold within 6 months to 12 months will incur a\n10 percent stamp duty, while those resold from 12 months to 24\nmonths will be charged 5 percent, Tsang said. The levy will be\nsplit between buyers and sellers, he said.  Down payments for homes costing HK$12 million or more will\nbe increased from 40 percent and for those between HK$8 million\nand HK$12 million from 30 percent, Hong Kong Monetary Authority\nChief Executive  Norman Chan  said Nov. 19. The maximum loan to\nvalue for non owner-occupied residential properties will be\nlowered to 50 percent, Chan said.  \u201cThe unusual surge in flat prices has attracted\nspeculators; this coupled with quantitative easing measures have\ndistorted the market expectation regarding inflation and asset\nprices,\u201d Tsang said. \u201cThe government is resolute in\nmaintaining economic stability and curbing any threat to\npeople\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d  It was the second time the government raised down-payment\nrequirements this year. On Aug. 13 it increased them for\napartments costing HK$12 million or more and for investment\nproperties to 40 percent, from 30 percent.  \u2018Extra Careful\u2019  Policy makers in Singapore share Tsang\u2019s concern that\nhousing price gains may make homes unaffordable to locals. In\nAugust, Singapore tightened mortgages and levied a stamp duty on\nall sales of residential units and land within three years of\nthe purchase date.  Hong Kong house prices grew at the third-fastest pace in\nAsia in the second quarter from a year earlier, behind Singapore\nand China, according to research by London-based real-estate\nconsultant Knight Frank LLP.  \u201cWe have to be extra careful,\u201d said Chow Suet-kuen, a\nretired civil servant who is looking to buy an investment\napartment, a day after the government\u2019s measures. \u201cWe\u2019re not\nspeculators, but the extra stamp duties may force us to hold\nonto the properties longer and the new mortgage rules may mean\nwe have to pay more for the down payment. We\u2019ll probably wait a\nbit to see how the market reacts before making a decision.\u201d  Chow, who was with her husband, son and daughter-in-law at\nthe Hung Hom district sales office for  Cheung Kong (Holdings)\nLtd.\u2019s  Festival City Phase II project in Sha Tin district, said\nher family was a long-term investor and owned three other\ninvestment properties in the Kowloon area.  Deterring Speculators  Cheung Kong, the city\u2019s second-biggest developer by market\nvalue, started selling 335 units at Festival City Phase II late\non Nov. 19. Cooling measures have come \u201clate,\u201d said  Justin Chiu , executive director at Cheung Kong, controlled by Hong\nKong\u2019s richest man  Li Ka-shing . The measures target short-term\nspeculation, which accounted for less than 5 percent of total\nhome sales, Chiu said Nov. 20.  Hong Kong Mortgage Corp., a government-backed home-loan\ninsurer, will introduce a cap of HK$6.8 million on the value of\nproperties it covers, it said in a statement Nov. 19.  The measures are \u201cdefinitely going to be effective\ndeterring speculators, but may also hurt users as well,\u201d said\nBuggle Lau, chief analyst at  Midland Holdings Ltd. , Hong Kong\u2019s\nbiggest publicly traded real-estate agency. \u201cWe expect\ntransactions in November will drop by as much as a third and\nprices will very likely stay flat.\u201d  IMF Warning  With abundant liquidity in the market, unless the owners\nare really in need of cash they won\u2019t sell their apartments at a\ndiscount in a hurry, said Lau.  The IMF said in a report this week Hong Kong\u2019s accelerating\nasset  inflation  risks causing a bust that leads to deflation and\nan extended economic \u201cdownturn,\u201d and urged further measures to\nrein in prices.  The government this year also has stopped offering\nresidency to foreigners who buy property in the city and pledged\nto increase land supply to curb prices, which surpassed a 1997\npeak on the back of record-low mortgage rates and an influx of\nbuyers from China.  In April, Hong Kong raised the tax on homes selling for\nmore than HK$20 million to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent.  Still, Fred Leung, a 40-year-old businessman looking to buy\nan apartment to live in at Festival City, said the stamp duty\nwouldn\u2019t affect him, though he may put off purchasing.  \u201cI can see how the stamp duties would impact speculators,\nbut that doesn\u2019t really concern me,\u201d said Leung a day after\nTsang announced the measures. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to\nmake a decision now since I actually hope the developer will\nlower prices for the later units after the government launched\nthe measures.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\n Kelvin Wong  in Hong Kong at \n kwong40@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAndreea Papuc at \n apapuc1@bloomberg.netoomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 30.327177047729492 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
