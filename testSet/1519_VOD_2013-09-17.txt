 "context": "The following article called 'AT&T Said to Seek Sale of Cell Towers Valued at $5 Billion' was published on 2013-09-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone\ncompany, is seeking buyers for its wireless towers and working\nwith  TAP Advisors LLC  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  on the sale,\naccording to people familiar with the matter.  The assets could fetch about $5 billion and possible buyers\ninclude  Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI) ,  SBA Communications\nCorp. (SBAC)  and  American Tower Corp. (AMT) , said one of the people, who\nasked not to be identified because the process isn\u2019t public.\nAT&T said in March that it is open to the sale of the wireless\ntowers and other peripheral assets.  A sale would bolster AT&T\u2019s balance sheet as it undertakes\na $14 billion network upgrade, plans a stock buyback that may\ntop $11 billion, and considers acquisitions in  Europe . The tower\nindustry is consolidating, with fewer companies controlling\nbigger swaths of the equipment needed to transmit wireless\nsignals amid booming demand for mobile communications.  American Tower, the biggest operator of cellular towers in\nthe U.S., agreed to buy the parent company of Global Tower\nPartners for $4.8 billion, including debt, earlier this month.\nThe company and rival Crown Castle are increasing their role in\nthe wireless industry, with many carriers selling their cell\nsites to the companies and leasing space back.  AT&T shares rose less than 1 percent to $34.75 at the close\nin  New York  today.  Profit Focus  The tower sales let carriers focus on more profitable parts\nof their businesses -- similar to the movement to offload office\nbuildings and lease them back from real estate companies. Tower\noperators can lease space on their sites to multiple carriers,\nenabling them to squeeze more profit out of the assets.  In addition to this month\u2019s Global Tower deal, American\nTower agreed last month to buy almost 4,500 wireless sites from\n NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD)  in Brazil and Mexico for a total of $811\nmillion.  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) \u2019s T-Mobile USA agreed to sell the\nrights to operate 7,200 cellular towers to Crown Castle for $2.4\nbillion last September.  TAP Advisors was an adviser to T-Mobile on that deal, along\nwith Deutsche Bank AG.  Spokesmen for AT&T, JPMorgan, and American Tower declined\nto comment. Representatives of Crown Castle, SBA Communications\nand TAP Advisors didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment.  Annual Sales  AT&T has about 10,000 towers, which generate about $326\nmillion in annual revenue as other companies pay to lease space\non the facilities, according to JPMorgan research analyst Phil Cusick. The towers may generate cash flow of about $216 million\na year, and a sale at 17-times that figure would fetch about\n$3.7 billion, he said in a note last month.  The company has explored acquisitions in Europe this year\nand would look at  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  assets after the U.K.\ncompany sells its stake in a wireless venture with Verizon\nCommunications Inc., people with knowledge of the matter said.  Last November, AT&T said it will invest $14 billion over\nthree years to improve the networks that deliver wireless\ncommunications, high-speed Internet access and television\nservices.
