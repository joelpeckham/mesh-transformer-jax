 "context": "The following article called 'UBS Sees Turkey Credit Risk Rising as HSBC Says Rupee to Drop on $120 Oil' was published on 2012-03-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe biggest losers from oil\u2019s rise\nabove $120 a barrel are Turkey, South Korea,  India  and  Sri Lanka \nas higher energy costs widen trade deficits and boost inflation,\naccording to strategists at the largest banks.  UBS AG is advising clients to buy credit default swaps on\nTurkey and bet South Korea\u2019s won will weaken against the dollar.\nMorgan Stanley has \u201cunderweight\u201d recommendations on Turkish\nand Indian stocks, while HSBC Holdings Plc says the rupee will\ndepreciate. Sri Lanka\u2019s currency, the world\u2019s second-worst\nperformer in 2012, may fall further, according to Citigroup Inc.  Crude\u2019s 16 percent advance in  London  trading this year is\nincreasing costs for oil-importing nations just as their exports\nslow because of  Europe \u2019s economic contraction and the weakest\nChinese expansion in more than two years. While  China \u2019s leaders\nsignaled last month they may loosen monetary policy and  Brazil \ncut its benchmark  interest rate  yesterday, traders are raising\nestimates for borrowing costs in India,  Turkey  and  South Korea (KWSWO1) \non speculation inflation will accelerate.  \u201cThe markets are beginning to get concerned,\u201d  Bhanu Baweja , the global head of emerging-market fixed-income and\ncurrency strategy at UBS in London, said in a phone interview\nyesterday. \u201cThe last thing they need is negative news on oil.\u201d  Brent oil futures rose to a 3 1/2-year high this month on\nconcern the dispute between Western nations and  Iran  over the\nPersian Gulf country\u2019s nuclear program will lead to military\nconflict, cutting production from a region that holds more than\nhalf the world\u2019s crude. Brent oil for April settlement increased\n1.8 percent yesterday to $124.12 a barrel on the London-based\nICE Futures Europe exchange, while futures traded in  New York \nsettled at $106.16 a barrel.  BRIC Tightening  Oil in London is still trading 20 percent below its\n inflation-adjusted peak  in July 2008 and 5.8 percent less than\nthe level in April 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The\nsurge in crude during those periods buffeted the global economy\nas Brazil, Russia, India and China, the four-biggest  emerging\nmarkets , tightened monetary policy to combat inflation.  The countries haven\u2019t raised borrowing costs this year.\nBrazil cut its benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points, or 0.75\npercentage point, to 9.75 percent yesterday, while China reduced\nbanks\u2019 reserve requirements last month and Premier Wen Jiabao\nsaid the country needs to start \u201cfine-tuning\u201d economic\npolicies to support growth. India and Russia have kept benchmark\ninterest rates unchanged in 2012.  \u201cIt\u2019s too early to assess the impact\u201d of this year\u2019s\nrally in crude, Arjun Divecha, chairman and head of emerging\nmarkets at GMO LLC, which oversees about $97 billion, said in a\nMarch 1 interview in New York. \u201cIt depends on how long the oil\nspike will last.\u201d  Turkey Vulnerable  Oil climbed 0.9 percent to $125.17 a barrel at 1:03 p.m. in\nLondon while global stocks and emerging-market currencies\nadvanced after Germany\u2019s industrial output increased more than\nforecast and Greece moved closer to completing its debt swap.\nTurkey\u2019s benchmark equity index rose 1.6 percent, while the\nSouth Korean won strengthened 0.6 percent against the dollar and\nthe Sri Lankan rupee appreciated 0.1 percent. India\u2019s financial\nmarkets were closed for a public holiday.  Turkey, the seventh-biggest emerging economy, is vulnerable\nto higher oil because of the country\u2019s current-account deficit,\nUBS\u2019s Baweja said. The  gap  was probably 10.3 percent of gross\ndomestic product in 2011, the biggest in emerging markets and up\nfrom 5.7 percent in 2008, according to the  International\nMonetary Fund .  Turkey Inflation  Every $10-a-barrel increase in oil adds $4 billion to the\ncost of imports, or about 0.5 percentage point of GDP, Turkey\u2019s\nEnergy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said on Feb. 28.  Rising energy prices also pose a risk to inflation, Central\nbank Governor Erdem Basci said the same day. Turkey\u2019s consumer\nprices increased 10.4 percent in February, within almost 20\nbasis points of the fastest pace in three years.  Yields (IESM2Y)  on the government\u2019s benchmark two-year notes have\nclimbed 32 basis points this month to 9.25 percent. The lira\nretreated 1.8 percent versus the dollar, while the  ISE National\n100 Index (XU100)  of shares slid 2 percent. Arcelik AS, Turkey\u2019s biggest\nproducer of household appliances, and Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS,\nthe Turkish unit of Ford Motor Co., fell on concern higher\nenergy costs will reduce consumer demand.  \u2018Begin to Worry\u2019  \u201cIf oil pushes higher, the market will begin to worry\nabout stock market stability, inflation and the currency, which\nwill all also have an impact on the CDS market,\u201d UBS\u2019s Baweja\nwrote in a Feb. 28 research report.  The strategist advised clients to buy  five-year credit\ndefault swaps  on Turkey, which cost 235 basis points yesterday,\nafter falling to a four-month low of 229.5 basis points on March\n2, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and\ncompiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated\nmarket. The contracts increase in value as perceptions of\ncreditworthiness deteriorate.  India\u2019s rupee weakened 2.5 percent against the dollar this\nmonth while the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of stocks retreated\n3.4 percent, the second-biggest decline among equity gauges in\n21 emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg after Hungary\u2019s BUX\nIndex. One-year interest-rate swaps, a gauge of expectations for\nfuture borrowing costs, are up 42 basis points this year to 8.17\npercent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u2018Oil Factor\u2019  Seven of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict\nIndia\u2019s central bank will leave its benchmark interest rate\nunchanged at a three-year high of 8.5 percent on March 15, even\nafter the government said economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent\nin the fourth quarter, the weakest pace since 2009.  For every $10-a-barrel increase in oil, India\u2019s inflation\nrate may rise by 0.9 percentage point and government subsidy\ncosts may climb by 0.3 percent of GDP, according to Morgan\nStanley.  \u201cThe market has started to discriminate a lot more on the\noil factor,\u201d  Jonathan Garner , the chief Asia and emerging-\nmarket strategist at Morgan Stanley in  Hong Kong , said in a\nphone interview yesterday. For corporate profits, \u201cthere\u2019s a\npotential problem particularly for the oil-importing\ncountries,\u201d Garner said.  Forward contracts show traders are betting India\u2019s rupee\nwill weaken 5.6 percent against the dollar over the next 12\nmonths, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Daragh Maher\nand David Bloom, currency strategists at HSBC in London,\nrecommend selling the rupee against Malaysia\u2019s currency because\nthe smaller country is a net oil exporter, according to a March\n2 research report.  Won Outlook  Inflationary pressures are building in  South Korea  after\ngasoline prices in the sixth-biggest emerging economy increased\nto a record high, Sharon Lam, an economist at New York-based\nMorgan Stanley, wrote in a March 2 note. The nation\u2019s net crude\nimports amount to 7.3 percent of GDP, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nsaid in a Feb. 29 report.  Two-year  interest rate swaps  in South Korea have increased\n13 basis points this year to 3.51 percent, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The central bank will probably keep\nbenchmark borrowing costs unchanged at 3.25 percent today,\naccording to the median estimate of 16 economists surveyed by\nBloomberg.  The  Kospi Index of Korean shares  has retreated 2.4 percent\nthis month, while the won has slipped 0.5 percent. The currency\nmay extend declines as the surge in oil hurts the outlook for\ncorporate earnings, prompting overseas equity fund managers to\ncut holdings, according to UBS\u2019s Baweja. He recommends selling a\nbasket of won, Thai baht and Chilean pesos against the dollar.  Sri Lankan Slump  Sri Lanka\u2019s  Colombo All-Share Index (CSEALL)  has tumbled 9.8 percent\nthis year while the rupee weakened 6.3 percent against the\ndollar. The government let the currency depreciate to a record\nlow last month while boosting fuel prices and raising benchmark\ninterest rates in an attempt to narrow the island\u2019s trade\ndeficit. Sri Lanka depends on Iran for more than 90 percent of\nits oil needs, according to Oil Minister Susil Premajayantha.  Further increases in fuel prices may spur the rupee to\nweaken further, Johanna Chua, an economist at Citigroup in Hong\nKong, wrote in a Feb. 20 report. Investors should wait until\nApril to consider buying local-currency debt, she said.  Should oil prices keep rising, the won, lira and rupee may\nalso underperform, according to Alessio De Longis, a portfolio\nmanager at OppenheimerFunds Inc. in New York.  \u201cThese countries are very vulnerable to higher oil\nprices,\u201d said De Longis.
