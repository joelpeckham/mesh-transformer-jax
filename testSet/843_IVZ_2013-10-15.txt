The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNeil Woodford, who oversees the\nU.K.\u2019s largest equity fund, is leaving Invesco Perpetual after\nmore than 25 years to set up his own company.  Mark Barnett was named head of U.K. equities and will run\nthe  Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund (INVHIIA)  and the Invesco Perpetual\nIncome Fund, which have a combined 24.6 billion pounds ($39\nbillion) in assets, at the end of a six-month transition,\nInvesco said in a statement today. He currently manages 1.5\nbillion pounds in assets for four funds.  Woodford, 53, who oversees about 33 billion pounds in all,\nbecame one of the U.K.\u2019s best-known mutual fund managers by\npicking stocks that fit his view of the larger economy and\navoiding bank shares before the crash in 2008. He declined to\ncomment on his new venture in a statement, adding that details\nwill be provided after he departs on April 29.  \u201cI would be amazed if he doesn\u2019t raise a substantial\namount of money at the launch of the new funds,\u201d said Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services, a\n investment adviser  in London. \u201cI would be confident that he\nwill raise in excess of 5 billion pounds very quickly. Neil\nWoodford Inc. will bring in a lot of money.\u201d  Invesco\u2019s  shares  slumped as much as 7.4 percent to $32.08\nin  New York  trading, the biggest intraday decline since\nSeptember 2011. The selloff values the investment manager at\n$14.4 billion.  Woodford\u2019s Performance  Woodford has seen his flagship Invesco Perpetual High\nIncome Fund return 12 percent annually over the past five years,\nexceeding the returns of 57 percent of similar funds, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. It counts  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , BT\nGroup Plc,  British American Tobacco Plc (BATS) ,  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  and  BT\nGroup Plc (BT/A)  among its biggest holdings.  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  said today it put four of Invesco\u2019s funds\nunder review including the 14 billion-pound High Income Fund.\nChelsea Financial said it downgraded any fund associated with\nWoodford to hold until after it has met with Barnett.  \u201cMy decision to leave is a personal one based on my views\nabout where I see long-term opportunities in the fund-management\nindustry,\u201d Woodford, who joined the British unit of Atlanta-based  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ)  in 1988, said in the statement. \u201cMy\nintention is to establish a new fund-management business serving\ninstitutional and retail clients as soon as possible.\u201d  Barnett\u2019s Returns  Barnett, 43, who joined Invesco in 1996, currently runs\nfour funds including the Invesco Perpetual U.K. Strategic Income\nFund, which he has managed since 2006. It has 297 million pounds\nin assets under management. The fund returned 14.7 percent\nannually over five years, beating 79 percent of similar funds,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mark Dampier, head of research at  Hargreaves Lansdown Plc (HL/) ,\nthe U.K.\u2019s largest publicly traded broker, said investors should\nmaintain their holdings in Woodford\u2019s fund.  \u201cI myself will be remaining invested,\u201d he said. \u201cFor new\ninvestors we would suggest waiting until the new manager has\ntaken over the fund.\u201d  Woodford\u2019s departure follows a decision by Sanjeev Shah to\nstep down from Fidelity Worldwide Investment\u2019s flagship U.K.\nSpecial Situations Fund last month, five years after taking over\nfrom  Anthony Bolton . Shah stepped back from running money on a\nday-to-day basis after 17 years in the industry.

Mallon will work with fixed-income managers Paul Causer\nand Paul Read.  \u201cWe have planned for succession for many years and have\nbuilt a world-class investment culture,\u201d Mark Armour, chief\nexecutive officer of Invesco Perpetual, said in the statement.\n\u201cBarnett is an exceptional  fund manager  who has the same\nactive, value-driven investment approach and long-term focus as\nNeil.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSarah Jones in  London  at \n sjones35@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nEdward Evans at \n eevans3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Invesco Plc was 23.95184326171875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Invesco Plc was ",
