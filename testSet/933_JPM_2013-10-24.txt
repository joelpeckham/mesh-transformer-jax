The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nICU Medical Inc. (ICUI) , the producer of\nintravenous medical systems that put itself up for sale in May,\nhas ended the process without finding a buyer, two people with\nknowledge of the matter said.  ICU, which was working with JPMorgan Chase & Co., held\ntalks with buyers including private-equity firm  GTCR LLC , one of\nthe people said, asking not to be identified as the information\nis private. In its quarterly report  filed  this week, the San\nClemente, California-based company said it incurred one-time\ncharges of about $800,000 \u201cassociated with a strategic\ntransaction that did not go forward,\u201d without offering more\ndetails.  GTCR held exclusive talks with ICU in August, people with\nknowledge of the matter said at the time. The Chicago-based firm\nbacked away from the deal because it couldn\u2019t agree on a price\nwith ICU, one of the people said recently. While there is a\nchance a buyer may come back, ICU is not holding active\nnegotiations with anyone currently, one of the people said.  ICU Chief Financial Officer Scott Lamb, who handles media\ninquiries, didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment on\nthe sale process. A spokeswoman for GTCR declined to comment.  ICU fell 6.3 percent, or $4.29, to $63.75 at 1:56 p.m. in\nNew York today.  Management Change  ICU\u2019s founder George Lopez stepped down from his role as\nchief executive officer for health reasons, the company said on\nOct. 21. Lopez, who owns an 11 percent stake in ICU, would be\none of the primary beneficiaries of a sale of the company, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show. Steven Riggs, vice president of\noperations for ICU, will serve as acting CEO, the company said.  ICU got its start almost 30 years ago when Lopez began\nworking on a device to prevent IV lines from accidentally\ndisconnecting, the company\u2019s  website  shows. Among its products\nis a connector called the Clave, which doctors or nurses use to\nattach the feed from a nutrition or saline bag, or a dose of\nmedicine, into a patient\u2019s IV port, using a sterile, needle-free\nconnection.
