 "context": "The following article called 'Aussie Sets 2012 Low Amid Concern Greece May Leave Euro' was published on 2012-05-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia \u2019s dollar declined to the\nweakest level this year as Greece\u2019s failure to form a new\ngovernment spurred speculation it may leave the euro area,\nsapping demand for riskier assets.  The so-called Aussie was near a four-month low against the\nyen as Asian stocks fell for a sixth-straight day, extending a\nglobal equities rout. The  New Zealand dollar  dropped for a\nfourth day after Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd.,\nthe world\u2019s largest dairy exporter, said whole-milk powder\nprices continued their slide, falling to the lowest level in\nmore than 2 1/2 years.  \u201cIt\u2019s just a general bout of  risk aversion  around the\nglobe,\u201d said Derek Mumford, a director in Sydney at Rochford\nCapital, a currency risk management company. \u201cIt\u2019s not just\n Greece , it\u2019s the whole European situation. The Aussie is\ncertainly under pressure.\u201d  Australia\u2019s dollar touched 98.90 U.S. cents, the weakest\nsince Dec. 19, before trading at 98.92 as of 4:22 p.m. in\nSydney, 0.5 percent below the close in  New York  yesterday. The\ncurrency bought 79.50 yen from 79.67 yesterday, when it slid to\n79.39, the lowest since Jan. 17.  Mumford predicts the Australian currency will drop as low\nas 97.50 U.S. cents within the next couple of weeks.  The  New Zealand  dollar lost 0.5 percent to 76.56 U.S.\ncents, after sliding to 76.48, the least since Dec. 20. It was\nat 61.52 yen from 61.69, after falling to as low as 61.49, the\nweakest since Jan. 19.  Greek Election  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks dropped 2.6 percent\ntoday. The MSCI World Index of developed market shares fell 0.9\npercent yesterday.  Greek leaders will seek agreement today on an interim\ngovernment that will schedule new elections as early as June 10,\nafter President Karolos Papoulias failed to broker a governing\ncoalition in meetings yesterday.  The new election will follow an inconclusive May 6 vote\nthat boosted a political party opposed to Greece\u2019s international\nbailout into second place. Public opinion polls say that party,\nSyriza, may come in first next time, complicating Greece\u2019s\nefforts to avoid running out of cash by early July.  Elsewhere in  Europe , investor concern over  Spain \u2019s ability\nto reduce its budget shortfall has increased since Prime\nMinister  Mariano Rajoy  announced in March that the country will\nmiss a 2012 deficit goal set by the European Union.  Spanish 10-\nyear yields  this week climbed as high as 6.36 percent, the most\nsince Nov. 30.  Milk Prices  In New Zealand, Fonterra said milk powder for July delivery\nfell 9.6 percent from the May 1 sale to the lowest price since\nAugust 2009, according to a trade-weighted index. The near-term\ncontract fell for the 11th straight auction to $2,488 a metric\nton, the company said on its GlobalDairyTrade website.  The results \u201conly add to the evidence suggesting next\nseason\u2019s Fonterra dairy payout will be considerably lower than\nthe season just ending,\u201d  Mike Jones , a currency strategist at\nBank of New Zealand Ltd. in Wellington, wrote in a research\nnote.  Demand for Australia\u2019s currency was also limited after a\nprivate survey showed the nation\u2019s  consumer confidence  was\nlittle changed near the lowest level this year as concern about\nthe global outlook countered the boost provided by this month\u2019s\ndecision by the country\u2019s central bank to lower borrowing costs.  The sentiment index for May rose 0.8 percent to 95.3, a\n Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Melbourne Institute survey taken May\n7-11 of 1,200 consumers showed today in Sydney. From a year\nearlier, confidence is down 8.3 percent.  Yields on Australia\u2019s benchmark 10-year notes slid three\nbasis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.23 percent today.\nThe rate touched a record low of 3.201 percent yesterday. Three-\nyear yields fell four basis points today to 2.56 percent.
