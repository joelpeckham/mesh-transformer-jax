 "context": "The following article called 'Nothing Predicted Happened in 2011' was published on 2011-12-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRampaging natural catastrophes,\nglobal financial calamities, the deaths of despots and\ndesperados, the passing of America\u2019s greatest modern technical\ninnovator and roiling protests that shook the Arab world and\noccupied  Wall Street  -- they made 2011 a year that will be\n remembered  for its almost unrelenting turmoil.  While earthquakes, tsunamis, nuclear meltdowns, tornadoes,\nwildfires, flood and hurricanes roared from the natural world, a\ntidal wave of sovereign debt threatened to fracture the economic\none, shaking the foundations of the 18-year-old European Union\nand its common currency and whipsawing U.S. equity markets in\nthe process. Uprisings known collectively as the Arab Spring\nspread from Tunisia in January to rock Egypt, liberate Libya and\nthreaten the Assad regime in Syria.  It was a bad year to be a dictator or terrorist. Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is on trial in the country he once ran, Libyan\ndictator  Muammar Qaddafi  was hunted down and killed by rebels\nand Osama bin Laden, mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, was shot to\ndeath by U.S. Navy Seals in a raid on his Pakistan compound. A\nmissile fired by a U.S. drone in Yemen killed al-Qaeda operative\nAnwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born Muslim cleric accused of helping to\nplot attacks on Americans.  This month, the U.S. ended the war in Iraq after almost\nnine years, with the last combat troops rolling out on Dec. 18.\nThat, and bin Laden\u2019s death, were among the \u201cnotable\u201d positive\ndevelopments in a year few will be sorry to see go, said Lee\nClarke, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University in New\nBrunswick,  New Jersey .  \u2018Uncertainty Everywhere\u2019  \u201cWhat seems most compelling about so many of the events of\n2011 is their uncanny similarity to the narrative that began to\nunspool in 1932, when the full shock of the Great Depression\u2019s\nimpact began to be fully absorbed,\u201d said David M. Kennedy, the\nPulitzer-prize winning historian and McLachlan Professor of\nHistory emeritus at Stanford University. \u201cThe implosion of\nover-stressed established regimes, the demonstrated obsolescence\nof vested ways of thinking, the emergence of new leaders, new\nideas, new institutions, new ways of life -- the \u2018new normal\u2019 in\nrealm after realm around the world.\u201d  It suggests that \u201cthe age of American global hegemony is\nalmost certainly winding down,\u201d Kennedy said, and that 2011\n\u201cmight mark the definitive end of the post-World War II and\npost-Cold War eras, and prove the portal to a future in which\nthere are many more powerful and ambitious players on the world\nstage, more bitter political contestation at home, and more\nuncertainty everywhere than at any time since the 1930s.\u201d  \u2018Scary Year\u2019  Still, James E. Mueller, a historian at the University of\nNorth Texas Mayborn School of Journalism in Denton, said he\nthinks perspective is in order.  \u201cMy take on 2011, and most years, is that we\u2019ve seen it\nall before,\u201d said Mueller, who is writing a book on the events\nleading to the 1876  Battle of the Little Bighorn , where George\nCuster and his 7th Calvary Regiment were routed by Indian\ntribes. The country was in deep recession, Native American\nuprisings threatened to uproot settlers from much of the West\nand former Confederate army units were fighting an insurgency\nthroughout the South, with omens of rekindling the Civil War.  \u201cThat was a scary year,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cLife is always\ntough, the news is always sensational, but we seem to always\nmuddle through somehow.\u201d  The U.S. wasn\u2019t immune from protest in 2011, though it came\nin gentler form than it did for  Egypt  or Libya. In September,\nmembers of the Occupy Wall Street movement began camping in\nLower Manhattan\u2019s Zuccotti Park. Organizers said they wanted to\nbring attention to U.S. income equality and what they consider\nto be the corrosive role of Wall Street in the economic crisis.  Nuclear Meltdown  The occupation ended on Nov. 15 when police moved in, took\ndown tents and arrested about 200 protesters. The movement\nsparked similar protests in other cities around the globe.  Worldwide in 2011, natural disasters, led by the March 11\nJapan earthquake and tsunami, took a $350 billion chunk out of\nthe economy, according to reinsurer Swiss Re Ltd. Insurers were,\nin a way, lucky, with Swiss Re saying they are on the hook for\nonly $108 billion of those losses.  The Japanese temblor and giant wave, which set off the\nFukushima nuclear power-plant meltdown, amounted to the\ncostliest of the calamities, with more than 15,000 dead and\n3,400 missing, according to  Japan \u2019s National Police Agency, and\n$35 billion in insured damages.  One month before, a magnitude-6.3 quake struck\nChristchurch, New Zealand\u2019s second-largest city, toppling\nbuildings, trapping office workers and killing 181 people.\nDamage was estimated at $12 billion.  Torrential Rain  The U.S. took a beating from natural disasters as well,\nsuffering $52 billion in damage through November, according to\nthe federal  National Climatic Data Center .  The biggest hit came from tornadoes roaming across the Ohio\nValley and Southeastern U.S. in April that killed 321, pummeled\nmetropolitan areas such as Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Chattanooga,\nTennessee, and resulted in $10.3 billion in losses. In August,\nHurricane Irene dropped torrential rain across  Connecticut ,\n Vermont  and other parts of the Northeast, resulting in flooding\nthat caused at least 45 deaths and $7.3 billion damages, the\ncenter said in a report.  Then  Virginia  and much of the East Coast were shaken by a\n 5.8 magnitude earthquake  that rattled the ground in more than 11\nstates, though it caused minimal damage. The tremor, whose\nepicenter was 84 miles southwest of  Washington , was the largest\nto strike Virginia since 1897.  Debt Crises  While worldwide natural catastrophes garnered headlines,\nworld leaders sought to avoid financial disasters. The European\ndebt crisis, simmering since late 2009, escalated in April as\n Portugal  joined  Greece  in seeking a bailout; Ireland followed in\nNovember. With hundreds of billions of dollars in sovereign debt\nand the stability of Spain and Italy in question, European\nleaders on Dec. 19 shored up their anti-crisis arsenal,\nchanneling 150 billion euros ($196 billion) to the  International\nMonetary Fund .  Prospects that the euro zone could fall apart have been at\nthe heart of world stock market volatility. The costs would be\n\u201chorrific,\u201d Paul Donovan, deputy head of global economics at\nUBS AG, told Bloomberg Television Dec. 16, risking \u201ca global\ndepression on the scale of the 1930s.\u201d  The U.S. had its own debt struggles. In August,  Standard &\nPoor\u2019s  lowered the country\u2019s long-term sovereign debt rating to\nAA+ from AAA, as Congress reached an 11th-hour accord to raise\nthe $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. The change came, the ratings\ncompany said, because the debt deal wouldn\u2019t \u201cstabilize the\ngovernment\u2019s medium-term debt dynamics.\u201d The Obama\nadministration called the move \u201cpolitical.\u201d  Fed Documents  So far, the downgrade seems to have hurt little but\nAmerica\u2019s pride. Dollar-denominated financial assets have been\nappreciating since the Aug. 5 decision, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Government bonds have returned 3.8\npercent, the dollar has gained 7.2 percent relative to a basket\nof currencies and the S&P 500 Index of stocks has rallied 3.7\npercent. Borrowing costs have fallen to record lows, with the\naverage monthly yield in November on 10-year notes below 2\npercent for the first time since 1950. The U.S. was seen as the\nbest performing market in the world among international\ninvestors in a Bloomberg poll this month.  U.S. economic policy was in the news in March when the\nSupreme Court upheld a lower-court decision and ordered the\n Federal Reserve  to release the details of emergency loans it\nmade to banks in 2008. The records had been sought by Bloomberg\nNews\u2019s parent company, Bloomberg LP, in a lawsuit after the Fed\nrefused a federal Freedom of Information Act request.  Hacking Scandal  The data showed, among other things, that banks took tens\nof billions of dollars in emergency loans at the same time they\nwere assuring investors their firms were healthy. On their\nneediest day, Dec. 5, 2008, the banks were in trouble so deep\nthey required a combined $1.2 trillion, Bloomberg reported.  Across the Atlantic, another media company became a story.\nNews Corp., controlled by Rupert Murdoch, closed its News of the\nWorld tabloid in July after revelations that staffers had been\ninvolved in hacking the mobile phone of a slain crime victim.  The scandal has led to at least 16 arrests, among them  Andy Coulson , a former News of the World editor and one-time\ncommunications chief for Prime Minister David Cameron, and the\nresignation of several senior Murdoch lieutenants. On Dec. 20,\nthe company\u2019s British publishing unit said it resolved seven\ncivil lawsuits over the interception of celebrities\u2019 voice-mail\nmessages to get scoops for the tabloid.  Throughout the year, the world was riveted by violent\ncrimes, and sensational allegations.  Mass Shootings  In January, Representative  Gabrielle Giffords , an Arizona\nDemocrat, was shot in the head in Tucson while she met with\nconstituents at a supermarket. The alleged gunman, 22-year-old\nJared Lee Loughner, killed six people, including a federal\njudge, and wounded 12 others besides Gifford. Loughner\npotentially faces the death penalty.  In May, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French national heading\nthe International Monetary Fund, quit after sexual assault\nallegations by a  New York  hotel worker landed him in jail under\n$5 million bond. Charges were dropped in August after\nprosecutors decided the accuser had repeatedly lied. The ex-IMF\nchief still faces a civil lawsuit over the matter.  Another mass shooting captured global attention in July. In\nNorway, 32-year-old  Anders Behring Breivik  set off a bomb in\nOslo and later attacked a summer camp, murdering 77 civilians,\nmany of them teenagers, some as young as 14.  London  Riots  While Breivik had written extensively about what he called\n\u201ccultural Marxism\u201d and rising \u201cIslamization\u201d in his country,\nNorwegian forensic psychiatrists in November declared him insane\nat the time of the attack, saying he suffered from paranoid\nschizophrenia. He faces lifelong compulsory psychiatric\ntreatment and likely will avoid a prison term, authorities said.  The next month, riots spread across London, Manchester and\nother cities and towns in the U.K., killing five, resulting in\nmore than 3,300 arrests and causing an estimated $328 million in\ndamage. British police, caught by surprise, were criticized for\nnot stepping in more quickly or firmly in some cases. The\nuprisings\u2019 causes -- with some blaming racism and poverty,\nothers a culture of entitlement -- are still being debated.  The riots cast a pall across Britain in what had been a\nyear uplifted by the April 29 marriage of Prince William to Kate Middleton in Westminster Abbey. As many as 1 million people\nlined London\u2019s streets, and an estimated 2 billion watched on\ntelevision. By some estimates, the wedding added about 620\nmillion pounds ($971 million) to the country\u2019s tourism revenue.  Steve Jobs  In the U.S. one of America\u2019s leading public schools, Penn\nState University, was rocked in November when Jerry Sandusky, a\nformer assistant to legendary football coach Joe Paterno, was\naccused of sexually assaulting or having inappropriate contact\nwith at least eight underage boys on or near school property\nover a 15-year period. A grand jury returned a 40-count\nindictment against Sandusky, who has said he is innocent. The\nuniversity fired Paterno and President Graham Spanier, saying\nneither had done enough after the allegations first surfaced.  The death in October of Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs,\nwho had pancreatic cancer, precipitated a global outpouring.\nMourners flocked to Apple stores from New York to  Hong Kong ,\nwhile a crowd gathered in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Dolores Park\nfor an iPhone-lit vigil.  Jobs wasn\u2019t simply a pivotal player in ushering in the age\nof personal computers, he was a digital visionary who changed\nthe way music and movies are distributed and who, with the\ninvention of the iPhone, took the concept of the cell phone to\nheights unimagined by competitors. He was 56.  Another death, of North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il on Dec.\n17, elevated to the head of the nuclear state his son, Kim Jong Un, about whom little is known, including his exact age.  As the year drew to a close, President Barack Obama marked\nthe end of the war in  Iraq  with a military ceremony at Joint\nBase Andrews outside Washington. An estimated 4,500 U.S.\npersonnel were killed and about 32,000 were wounded in the\nconflict. The war cost the U.S. more than $800 billion.
