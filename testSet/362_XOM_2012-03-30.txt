 "context": "The following article called 'Flaherty Bets on Oil in Budget as Canada Cuts 12,000 Jobs' was published on 2012-03-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  is betting  oil companies  such as  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and\nEnbridge Inc. will boost the world\u2019s 10th largest economy out of\na sluggish recovery.  Flaherty released a 2012  fiscal plan  yesterday that pledges\nto expedite the environmental review of Enbridge\u2019s Northern\nGateway pipeline, which would move crude from  Alberta \u2019s  oil\nsands  to  Asia , capitalizing on demand for natural resources. The\nmeasure comes in a budget that includes the firing of 12,000\ngovernment workers and defers defense spending to eliminate a\ndeficit by 2015.  \u201c We want to be with the emerging economies,\u201d Flaherty\ntold reporters in Ottawa. \u201cWe want to be with the economies of\nAsia and  South America  that are growing.\u201d  Since winning a parliamentary majority in last year\u2019s\nelections, Prime Minister  Stephen Harper \u2019s Conservative\ngovernment has pledged to bolster Canada\u2019s long-term finances\nand take steps to support  economic growth , in part by developing\nthe country\u2019s resource wealth and encouraging business\ninvestment.  Flaherty\u2019s budget forecasts Canada\u2019s growth will slow to\n2.1 percent this year from 2.5 percent in 2011, before\naccelerating to 2.4 percent in the next three years. Canada\naveraged annual growth of 3.1 percent in the decade before the\nglobal recession.  Policy makers, including Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney , have urged Canadian businesses to take over from\nindebted households and boost investment to sustain the economic\nexpansion. Yesterday\u2019s budget includes measures to encourage\nresearch and innovation and speed immigration for skilled\nworkers.  Flaherty, in his seventh fiscal plan, announced spending\ncuts totaling C$21 billion ($21 billion) over the next five\nyears that will help reduce the country\u2019s deficits by a\ncumulative C$18.4 billion. The budget released in Ottawa kept\nFlaherty\u2019s 2015-16 timetable for a return to surplus.  \u201cThe Canadian economy is running pretty well, so they\u2019re\njust fine-tuning the engine to make sure it runs well,\u201d said\n Craig Wright , chief economist of Royal Bank of  Canada .  Recent data have shown weakening  jobs growth , prompting\nFlaherty to boost employment insurance benefits in regions with\nhigh unemployment rates. More generous jobless payments will\ncost the government C$2.7 billion over six years, according to\nthe budget.  To encourage investments in resources, Flaherty\u2019s plan\nseeks to expedite energy projects by consolidating the agencies\nthat conduct environmental reviews, setting hard deadlines on\nthe process and allowing provincial agencies to study smaller\nprojects in a bid to reduce duplication.  Alberta, home to the world\u2019s third largest pool of oil\nreserves and Canada\u2019s lowest unemployment rate, is working to\nincrease capacity to transport crude amid opposition from\nenvironmental groups as companies such as  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and\nSuncor invest about C$20 billion annually in the oil sands.  The government began hearings in January on Enbridge\u2019s\nproposed Northern Gateway pipeline, which has become a\nflashpoint between environmentalists and Harper\u2019s government.\nRegulators have received more than 4,000 requests by individuals\nto testify at public hearings.  Environmental and aboriginal groups say the project will\nincrease the risk of an  oil spill  off the coast of British\nColumbia. The regulatory panel has said it plans to complete the\nreview by the end of 2013.  An improving fiscal outlook allowed the federal government\nto limit cuts to federal  government spending . Canada\u2019s deficit\nin the fiscal year ending this month will come in at C$24.9\nbillion, less than the C$31 billion projected in Flaherty\u2019s last\n update  in November, because of faster-than-projected growth.  Departmental spending cuts, which don\u2019t include transfers\nto individuals or provinces, will total C$5.2 billion annually\nwhen fully implemented. The departments of defense and health\nand public safety face the biggest reductions. The government\nhad said it was considering cuts of as much as C$8 billion.  Federal  employment  will fall by 19,200, or 4.8 percent of\nthe total, including 7,200 positions to be cut by expected\nattrition.  Growth in program spending, projected at C$245.3 billion\nnext year, will average 2.1 percent over the next five years,\nreducing it as a share of GDP to 12.8 percent by 2016, its\nlowest since 2005. Total spending, including public debt\ncharges, is projected to grow 1.2 percent to C$276.1 billion in\nthe 2012-13 fiscal year. The federal debt as a share of output\nis forecast to rise to 34.4 percent in the next fiscal year\nbefore falling 28.5 percent in 2016-17.  \u201cThis is the furthest thing from an austerity budget,\u201d\nsaid Catherine Swift, president of the Canadian Federation of\nIndependent Business. \u201cProgram spending continues to rise every\nyear simply at a lower rate.\u201d  Revenue is forecast to grow by an average 4.7 percent over\nthe past five years.  The plan forecasts deficits of C$21.1 billion in the year\nstarting April 1, C$10.2 billion in 2013-14, and C$1.3 billion\nin 2014-15. Surpluses of C$3.4 billion in 2015-16 and C$7.8\nbillion in 2016-17 are projected.  To secure the country\u2019s finances into next decade, Flaherty\npledged to introduce legislation raising the eligibility for the\nOld Age Security pension to 67 from 65. The changes start in\n2023, with a six-year phase-in. The plan also gives Canadians\nthe option to defer payments until later years in exchange for\nhigher benefits.  Deferred defense spending will save about C$2.9 billion\nover the next five years, with the elimination of tax credits\nand what the budget calls \u201cloopholes\u201d raising C$1.7 billion.  Among the measures to bolster business spending, Flaherty\nis setting aside C$400 million for venture capital funding,\nincreasing support for business research and providing\nadditional cash for university infrastructure. Measures to boost\nemployment and growth will total C$3.7 billion over five years.  Even with a shrinking deficit, the government will issue a\nnet C$97 billion of bonds next year, up from C$94 billion. The\ngovernment will add an auction of 10-year bonds while reducing\nthe amount of Treasury Bills it sells.  The government also announced it will stop production of\nthe penny this year, as each one-cent coin costs 1.6 cents to\nmake. The measure will save C$11 million a year.
