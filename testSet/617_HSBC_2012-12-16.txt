 "context": "The following article called 'Swiss Watch Boutiques Swap Christmas Trees for Hongbao' was published on 2012-12-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEven before the Christmas tree went\nup at 124-year-old  Bucherer  AG in the lakeside town of Lucerne,\nthe Swiss watch boutique was already planning decorations for\nthe year of the snake.  Chinese symbols marking the start of the lunar new year on\nFeb. 10 will greet the busloads of Asian shoppers who visit\nLucerne every day and invite them inside to see watches from TAG\nHeuer, Rolex and more than 20 other brands.  Less than half of the timepieces bought at the Lucerne\nstore in December may be for Christmas, according to Joerg\nBaumann, Bucherer\u2019s marketing director. That\u2019s a welcome boon as\nbanks cut jobs and Swiss unemployment hovers at its highest\nlevel in 20 months.  \u201cOther parts of the year have caught up\u201d with Christmas,\nBaumann said, \u201cwhich is good news for retailers because\neveryone wants a stable business and not an extremely seasonal\none.\u201d  Asian consumers are easing the Swiss watch industry\u2019s\nreliance on Christmas and offsetting Europe\u2019s slowing economy.\nWhile December is still the most important sales period, it\u2019s\ndiminishing in importance and may be surpassed by the Chinese\nNew Year within seven years, said Jean-Claude Biver, chairman of\n LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC)  SA\u2019s Hublot watch brand.  \u201cWhen I started 38 years ago, December and Christmas were\n30 percent of the business, but that has weakened as sales have\nbecome more and more constant during the 12 months,\u201d Biver said\nin his office overlooking Lake Geneva and the French Alps.\nChristmas now accounts for 15 percent to 20 percent of watch\nindustry revenue, he said.  Triple Taxation  China and  Hong Kong  make up the biggest market for Swiss\ntimepieces, accounting for 30 percent of exports of the\ncountry\u2019s roughly 200 brands in 2011, according to the\nFederation of the Swiss Watch Industry. Exports to those two\ndestinations rose 10 percent in the first 10 months of 2012.  Chinese interest in high-end watches remains strong despite\nconcerns about an easing of economic growth, according to\nDigital Luxury Group. The number of online searches for luxury\nwatch brands in China increased about 40 percent during the\nfirst half of the year, the researcher said.  Purchasing watches abroad allows Chinese consumers to\nsidestep three layers of taxes imposed on watches in China: an\n11 percent import duty, a 20 percent tax on high-end watches,\nand a 17.5 percent value-added tax, according to HSBC.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR) , the maker of Vacheron\nConstantin and Cartier watches, said last month that the\nweakness of the euro was luring more Asians to take vacations in\nEurope, helping boost revenue in the region.  \u201cLocal consumption in Switzerland is not bad and there\u2019s\nprobably even some growth, but the main driver is tourism,\u201d\nsaid Patrik Schwendimann, an analyst at Zuercher Kantonalbank.  Red Envelopes  Bucherer\u2019s six-story flagship in Lucerne gives visitors\nfrom China greeting cards in red envelopes called hongbao that\nare supposed to bring luck. A sign at the entrance lists some of\nthe 20-plus languages spoken by sales staff, while display\ncabinets describe watch features in Chinese.  To cope with the steady stream of Chinese shoppers, about\n30 of the 200-odd staff speak Mandarin. Bucherer also offers\nChinese-language lessons for employees, as well as training on\nhow best to interact with Asian shoppers and what the concept of\n\u201cface\u201d means for them.  Among the key sales periods for Bucherer, which has more\nthan 20 stores in  Switzerland ,  Germany  and  Austria , are the week\naround Chinese national day on Oct. 1, as well as Chinese new\nyear in January or February and the Thai new year in April,\nBaumann said.  Sales Machine  \u201cThe planning starts one year ahead in our themes and how\nwe decorate the stores,\u201d Baumann said. \u201cPeople want to know\nthey\u2019re in Switzerland, but it\u2019s a little gesture so they\u2019re\naware we know it\u2019s their holiday.\u201d  As many as 3,000 Asian tourists a day visit the Bucherer\nflagship in Lucerne after sightseeing in the surrounding Alpine\nlandscape. Sales at the shop could reach 1 million Swiss francs\n($1.1 million) daily at peak times, said Rene Weber, an analyst\nat Bank Vontobel in Zurich. The store doesn\u2019t disclose revenue.  \u201cIt\u2019s like a machine,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a Chinese person\ngoes on a trip to  Europe , they tend to start in  Italy  and end in\nParis or  London . In between, they usually stop in Switzerland\nand buy something at Bucherer in Lucerne.\u201d  More than 200,000 visitors from greater China stayed in\nLucerne or surrounding area during the first nine months of this\nyear, more than double the number during the same period in\n2007, according to the town\u2019s tourism bureau.  Phonetic Renderings  The winding streets around Bucherer, lined with ornate,\ncentury-old buildings, show the growing importance of Asian\ntourists. At some watch stores in the area Chinese signs are\nbigger than those in European languages, and shop windows\nsometimes display phonetic renderings of brand names in\nChinese characters.  Outside Bucherer, Zheng Xianjun takes in views of the\nbustling town center and lake after spending almost 3,000 francs\non a  Longines  watch for his wife.  \u201cI\u2019m not buying it for any special occasion,\u201d said Zheng,\na 40-year-old mobile phone salesman from  China \u2019s Guangdong\nprovince. \u201cI don\u2019t go abroad all that much and my wife wanted\nme to get her a watch while I was here.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDermot Doherty in Geneva  at \n ddoherty9@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nCeleste Perri at \n cperri@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 32.706661224365234 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
