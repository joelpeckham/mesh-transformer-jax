The step comes five weeks after 53-year-old American Craig Kreeger took over as chief executive officer, tasked with\nreinvigorating a business that\u2019s also being squeezed by airport\ncharges at its London Heathrow hub and cooperation among rivals.  \u201cVirgin Atlantic is committed to a plan of measured\nchanges, both in the short and long term, which addresses these\nchallenges head on,\u201d the Crawley, England-based company said\ntoday in a statement.  Replacing older jets with new planes should also help trim\nfuel costs, while the sale of a 49 percent stake to  Delta Air\nLines Inc.
