 "context": "The following article called 'Hirai Turns to PlayStation 3 Playbook to Deliver Stringer\u2019s Vision at Sony' was published on 2012-02-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWhen  Sony Corp. (6758) \u2019s 2006 release of\nPlayStation 3 flopped because features installed by the engineer\nwho founded the business made the games console too expensive,\nChief Executive Officer  Howard Stringer  tapped Kazuo Hirai to\nturn the division around.  Hirai, a liberal arts graduate who joined Sony\u2019s music\nventure fresh from college in 1984, set about jettisoning parts\nand outsourcing the manufacture of components, rolling out a\nslimline version of the console in 2009 and cutting its price by\n25 percent. As Stringer\u2019s newly announced successor, Hirai\nyesterday vowed to do the same streamlining for the whole group.  He needs to work fast to win over skeptical investors\nwaiting for Stringer to deliver on his promise that by forcing\nonce-clashing parts of Sony\u2019s Japanese and U.S. empire to mesh,\nhe would reverse ground lost to  Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co.\ntelevisions and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  phones and tablets. Shares in Japan\u2019s\nbiggest consumer-electronics company have fallen more than 60\npercent under Stringer\u2019s seven-year tenure.  \u201cHirai must walk away from the strategy of selling more\nthan others or winning a bigger market share than others,\u201d said\nKoji Toda, who oversees about $68 billion as chief  fund manager \nat Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo. \u201cWhen I was young, I had to have\na Sony product, but for the younger generation today it\u2019s\nApple.\u201d  Sony yesterday said it expects to make a loss of 220\nbillion yen ($2.9 billion) in the year ending March 31, more\nthan double its previous estimate. The Tokyo-based company cut\nrevenue forecasts on cameras, game consoles and personal\ncomputers, and said mobile phone sales were worse than expected.\nTelevision shipments would likely be 20 million units, down from\nthe 27 million projected at the beginning of the year, it said.  Yen, Apple  Hirai, 51, takes over from Stringer as Japanese companies\nare struggling to cope with a yen trading near a post-war high.\nThey\u2019re being undercut by lower-cost rivals, such as Vizio Inc.,\na closely held TV-maker based in  Irvine ,  California , that uses\ncheap screens from Taiwanese contract manufacturers.  Stringer also lost out to Apple\u2019s late founder  Steve Jobs \nin the race to deliver high-margin portable devices on which to\nsell the group\u2019s films, music and games content.  Hirai promised to review Sony\u2019s more than 2,000 products,\nand may exit those that are uncompetitive. Hirai in April also\nwill take the title of company president. Stringer, 69, will\nstay on as chairman of the board.  \u201cSony cannot continue walking on the same path,\u201d Hirai,\ncalled Kaz by associates, said at the earnings briefing in\nTokyo. \u201cSony needs to find new business areas, such as medical.\nWe also need to select and narrow our business portfolio.\u201d  Stock Jump  Sony\u2019s  shares  rose as much as 8.9 percent in  Tokyo  trading,\nthe biggest intraday gain since April 2009. The stock was 6.9\npercent higher at 10:36 a.m., while the benchmark Topix index\nwas little changed.  \u201cAll the bad factors have already been reflected,\u201d said\nMakoto Sengoku, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,\n\u201cThe shares are rising on expectations that the company will be\non track for rebuilding.\u201d  Hirai\u2019s task may be made easier by Stringer\u2019s work in\ntearing down silos between Sony\u2019s divisions that had prevented\nthe company marrying content from the acquisitions of  Columbia\nPictures  and CBS Records to its hardware, according to Sony\nEntertainment Network President Tim Schaaff.  \u201cKaz is in a position today to insist on an approach\ncategory by category which is consistent with the high-level\nglobal strategy,\u201d Schaaff said in a November interview.  Culture Gap  Hirai has another advantage over Stringer: an upbringing\nthat allows him to move effortlessly between Sony\u2019s U.S. and\nJapanese operations.  Stringer took over with a mandate to shake up Sony, which\nhad lost its mantle as the world\u2019s most valuable electronics\ncompany to Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung in 2002. As a\nforeigner, the Welshman would be less reluctant to take tough\ndecisions on axing jobs and unprofitable businesses.  Or so the theory went. Stringer, who can\u2019t speak Japanese,\nspent years not realizing many of his directives as CEO were\nbeing ignored by operating units run as fiefdoms, he said in an\ninterview last year.  In contrast, Hirai\u2019s childhood following his banker father\nbetween the U.S. and  Japan  left him fluent in both languages\nthough finding it difficult to blend in to either society,\naccording to a 2009 interview he gave to the alumni magazine of\nInternational Christian University in Tokyo.  \u2018Rosetta Stone\u2019  After moving to  New York , Hirai turned up to first grade\nwith three signs written in English hanging around his neck: \u201cI\nfeel unwell,\u201d \u201cI need the bathroom\u201d and \u201cplease contact my\nmother/father,\u201d he said in the interview. Now, the father of\ntwo flits between Tokyo and California, where his family lives.\nTall, thin and beginning to gray, Hirai speaks in unaccented\nAmerican English.  Michael Lynton, chairman of  Sony Pictures Entertainment ,\nrecalls Hirai breaking a logjam in an October 2010 meeting in\nJapan where U.S. and Japanese managers debated adopting a new\nstrategy.  \u201cHe really served well as a  Rosetta stone  in that moment\nto bridge the gap,\u201d Lynton said in a November interview. \u201cThis\nis an individual who understands two sides of the coin, not just\nthe content side and the electronics side. It\u2019s also the\nJapanese piece and the American piece.\u201d  Hirai\u2019s ascent wasn\u2019t smooth. One of \u201cFour Musketeers\u201d\nchosen by Stringer as possible successors, his nomination to\ntake over as president wasn\u2019t cleared by the board. Instead they\nannounced his appointment as executive deputy president in\nMarch, putting him on trial for the top job.  Tsunami, Riots  A day later, Japan was hit by the biggest earthquake on\nrecord, unleashing a tsunami that inundated the country\u2019s\nnortheast coast, shutting down factories and supply chains.  Two months into the job, Hirai was bowing in apology over a\nhacking attack that invaded the company\u2019s Internet entertainment\nservices in the second-largest online data breach in U.S.\nhistory. A fire caused by London rioters at a Blu-ray warehouse\nand disruptions from floods in  Thailand  crowned out the year for\nSony.  Hirai focused on ensuring the company\u2019s units stuck to\ntheir task of delivering content to his so-called four-screen\nstrategy -- computers, televisions, mobile phones and tablets.  Software, Hardware  \u201cI\u2019d like to think that I have the understanding of how\nhardware and software need to be in lockstep,\u201d Hirai said in\nNovember, noting that only recently has hardware become powerful\nenough to deliver Sony content across the four platforms.  After his stint in the music arm, Hirai moved to Sony\nComputer Entertainment America in 1995 and became president of\nthe U.S. unit in 1999. As lieutenant to Ken Kutaragi, Hirai cut\nhis teeth in the division that epitomized Stringer\u2019s vision of\nconvergence for Sony.  Four years after taking over from Kutaragi, Sony\u2019s game\nbusiness returned to profit, earning 46.5 billion yen in the\nyear ended March 2011. Losses totaled 448.8 billion yen during\nthe four years. Sales of the slimline PlayStation console jumped\nto records in the U.S. and Japan after it was introduced.  Sony last year also began offering games playable on\nsmartphones and tablets equipped with Google Inc.\u2019s Android\noperating system, reaching out beyond its PlayStation machines.  Still, for some analysts and investors Hirai\u2019s vows to trim\ncosts and focus on new businesses have a familiar ring. Stringer\naxed 30,000 jobs, shut factories and outsourced manufacturing.\nHe also announced $8.4 billion in acquisitions last year.  \u201cWhat Sony needs is a strong hit product,\u201d said  Masahiko Ishino , an analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\u201cThe company has carried out a lot of asset sales and\nstreamlining. A hit product can save it.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nMariko Yasu in Tokyo at \n myasu@bloomberg.net ;\nCliff Edwards in  San Francisco  at \n cedwards28@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nBen Richardson at \n brichardson8@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 13.935859680175781 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
