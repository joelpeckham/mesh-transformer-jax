 "context": "The following article called 'ABB Profit Rises on U.S. Construction, Demand in China' was published on 2013-07-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nABB Ltd. (ABBN) \u2019s shares declined the most\nin more than five weeks after the world\u2019s largest maker of power\ntransformers said lower power-utility investments in  Europe \nweighed on orders.  The stock dropped as much as 4.9 percent to 20.40 francs in\nZurich trading after ABB said today that second-quarter orders\nfell 7 percent from a year earlier to $9.3 billion. The shares\nwere down 4.8 percent as of 1 p.m. local time.  \u201cMajor transmission investments are being postponed as the\noverall economic climate remains challenging and growth in\nelectricity consumption remains at low levels,\u201d ABB said.\nFrench rival  Alstom SA (ALO)  yesterday also reported lower quarterly\norders on weaker spending by utilities and railways in Europe,\n Africa  and the  Middle East .  Chief Executive Officer Joe Hogan, who will hand over to\nUlrich Spiesshofer in September, has bet on growth in the U.S.\nwith more than $10 billion of acquisitions to add motors, low-voltage gear products and solar inverters, to reduce ABB\u2019s\nreliance on Europe. The first challenge for Spiesshofer, who\nheads the discrete automation and motion unit, will be to\nintegrate Hogan\u2019s deals, including electric motor-maker Baldor\nElectric, Thomas & Betts and solar company Power-One.  \u201cIt will be some time\u201d before power grid spending in\nEurope picks up, ABB Chief Financial Officer Eric Elzvik said on\na conference call. \u201cWe are continuing to invest in it and we\nthink there is a clear future there,\u201d he said, adding that ABB\nsees \u201ca lot of pending orders and tenders in high-voltage\ndirect current,\u201d in the region.  \u2018Going Sideways\u2019  Net income rose 16 percent to $763 million in the second\nquarter, the Zurich-based company said in a statement today.\nThat\u2019s the first profit increase in six quarters. The average\nestimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for $779\nmillion. Sales rose 6 percent to $10.2 billion, meeting the\nanalysts\u2019 estimates.  \u201c China  was good for us;  Germany  and parts of Northern\nEurope were good for us also,\u201d Hogan said in a  video  posted on\nthe company\u2019s website. \u201cWhat we see going forward is more of\nthe same. We see most of the markets going sideways over a\nperiod of time.\u201d  ABB kept its 2013 forecast and today reiterated comments\nfrom April, when Hogan said the company was prepared for a\n\u201cflat\u201d 2013 compared to 2012.  \u201cApart from the order intake the result was in line with\nexpectations,\u201d said Richard Frei, an analyst at Zuercher\nKantonalbank. ABB\u2019s greater project selectivity, especially in\nPower Systems, explains the lower order intake, he added.  About 50 to 60 percent of the order slowdown was because of\nABB\u2019s project selectivity while the remainder reflected the\neconomic cycle, Hogan said on a conference call today.  \u2018Positive Momentum\u2019  Spiesshofer takes over a company worth 50 billion francs\neight years after joining ABB and following 14 years as a\nconsultant. ABB\u2019s new CEO should focus on building the Swiss\ncompany\u2019s service business and integrating acquisitions, Hogan\nsaid on the call.  \u2018It\u2019s important particularly with the acquisitions we have\nmade that we maintain positive momentum,\u2019\u2019 Hogan said.  Spiesshofer oversaw the Baldor Electric deal and said this\nmonth that ABB is \u201cnow realizing the synergies\u201d of that\npurchase. Buoyed by the acquisition, the Zurich-based company\nincreased market share in the $14.6 billion low-voltage motors\nmarket by 1 percentage point to 14 percent in 2012, according to\na report by sector analysts IHS.  Thomas & Betts  Orders at the low-voltage unit rose 20 percent, buoyed by\nthe purchase of Thomas & Betts Corp. and increasing demand for\nswitchboards and low voltage gear in China,  Russia  and the U.S.,\nABB said.  The Power-One transaction, which will close in the second\nhalf and give ABB inverters that allow solar power to be fed\ninto grids, is an example of how Hogan has been bringing new\ntechnology to the Swiss company. ABB is looking to tap a market\nforecast to grow by more than 10 percent annually, driven by a\nneed for affordable energy and declining costs of producing\nsolar power.  Before today, ABB shares had gained 14 percent this year,\ncompared to the 5 percent rise of  Siemens AG (SIE) , which is midway\nthrough a program aimed at cutting costs by 6 billion euros\n($7.9 billion) by the end of 2014.  General Electric Co. (GE)  has\ngained 17 percent.
