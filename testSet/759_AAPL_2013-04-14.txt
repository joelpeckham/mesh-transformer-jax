 "context": "The following article called 'Gates Helps Australia\u2019s Richest Man in Bid to End Slavery' was published on 2013-04-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n(Corrects title in 12th paragraph of story run April 11.)  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  founder  Bill Gates , who has gifted $28 billion to his charitable foundation, gave some simple advice to  Australia \u2019s richest man  Andrew Forrest  on his crusade to end modern slavery: find a metric to quantify it.  \u201cGlobal modern slavery is hard to measure and Bill\u2019s a measure kind of guy,\u201d Forrest, 51, the founder of iron ore producer  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)  who formed the Walk Free anti-slavery charity last year, said in a phone interview. In McKinsey & Co. \u201cmanagement speak, if you can\u2019t measure it, it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.  Spurred by Gates, the world\u2019s second-richest person, Forrest plans to publish the Global Index of Modern Slavery in August, ranking the existence and efforts to fight involuntary servitude in 160 countries. Slavery generates about $32 billion in profits a year, according to the  International Labour Organisation , with activities such as sex trafficking and mining so-called conflict minerals used in electronics including laptops and mobile phones.  \u201cWhen it comes to the superwealthy, they hide behind the parapet sometimes with tough social issues,\u201d said Simon McKeon, chairman of the  Melbourne  office of  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia\u2019s biggest investment bank, who was named 2011 Australian of the Year for his charitable efforts. \u201cWhen someone like Andrew says I don\u2019t feel right that we still have slavery, then that\u2019s music to my ears.\u201d  Branson Joins  Forrest, who has a $4.3 billion fortune, according to the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index , and Virgin Group Ltd. Chairman  Richard Branson  in December officially started Walk Free in Myanmar, urging 25 top global companies and governments to stop using forced labor.  \u201cRichard has indicated that he will be fully supporting Walk Free,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cHe\u2019ll be joining in and helping in any way possible.\u201d  Branson and Forrest were among 12 new signatories who in February announced they had joined the Giving Pledge initiative started by  Warren Buffett , chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , Gates and his wife, Melinda. Forrest and his wife Nicola pledged to donate A$2.5 billion ($2.6 billion).  \u201cAndrew is quite an individual, and I can see similarities between him and Branson,\u201d said Peter Rudd, resources and mining manager at Altitude Private Wealth in Melbourne who has more than 20 years of experience in the sector. \u201cIf they can achieve something on the charitable side, all the better.\u201d  Fortescue (FMG)  fell 0.8 percent to A$3.95 at the close of trading in Sydney today. They\u2019ve fallen 15 percent this year. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.8 percent.  Slavery Index  Members of the  Giving Pledge  commit to give away at least half their wealth to charitable organizations and philanthropic causes. Co-founder Buffett, 82, is the world\u2019s third-richest person, with a net worth of $56.2 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s daily ranking. Gates, 57, has $68.5 billion.  An e-mail to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation seeking comment about Forrest\u2019s meetings with Gates wasn\u2019t answered.  The slavery index is being developed by a co-founder of Free the Slaves, Kevin Bales, Professor of Contemporary Slavery at the Wilberforce Institute at the University of Hull in the U.K., and Fiona David, a visiting fellow at the Centre for International and Public Law at the  Australian National University . It is scheduled to debut in August, Forrest said. The Ibrahim Index of African Governance, founded by Mo Ibrahim, the Sudanese-born billionaire founder of the telecommunications company Celtel International BV, was a source of inspiration, he said.  Risk Measures  The index is based on data on slave numbers from governments, international organizations and surveys, supplemented with statistical analysis and estimation, Walk Free said in an e-mail. Measures of risk come from more than 20 global surveys of indices from groups such as the International Labour Organization, the  United Nations  and the  World Bank .  Gates created the Seattle-based Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support organizations throughout the world aimed at improving education initiatives, enhancing health care and reducing poverty. Malaria, tuberculosis and polio are some of the diseases being targeted by the foundation. It was founded in 1997 and has an endowment of $36 billion.  Gates\u2019s polio and malaria \u201ccampaigns are global campaigns, and you can actually measure it quite easily if someone has the disease,\u201d Forrest said. \u201cModern-day slavery, because it\u2019s so illegal, it\u2019s much more difficult to measure. To get through this substantial measurement problem, we started the index.\u201d  Nepalese Orphanage  Forrest, who founded Australia\u2019s third-biggest  iron ore  producer in 2003, established Walk Free after his teenage daughter Grace volunteered in 2008 at an orphanage in  Nepal  and became aware of the extent of child slave trading. Seeing the condition of some of its victims prompted Forrest and his wife to act and they have so far given $260 million to the campaign and associated charities.  \u201cThere was a little girl who had been given a one-way ticket from a city in the Middle East to India. She was from Kathmandu and had been sent back,\u201d he said, adding the girl, who was about 11-12 years old, rocked and cried continuously in her bed. \u201cShe would have been part of the child sex slave trade into the  Middle East . It just really strengthened my resolve.\u201d  Forrest amassed his fortune supplying  China (AUITIRCV) \u2019s steel mills, after China\u2019s rapid growth ignited a decade-long mining boom in Australia, the world\u2019s biggest shipper of  iron ore  and coal. He has campaigned to improve Aboriginal employment and education and founded the Australian Children\u2019s Trust in 2001 to help the underprivileged.  \u2018Sweat Shops\u2019  Global regulators and organizations have been increasing their scrutiny of \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission introducing a rule last year forcing companies such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,  Boeing Co. (BA)  and thousands of other U.S.-listed manufacturers to find out whether their purchases of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold come from  Democratic Republic  of Congo mines supporting violent armed groups.  Congo produces about half the world\u2019s cobalt and about 3 percent of its copper and has large deposits of gold, tin, diamonds and coltan, an ore containing the metal tantalum, which is used in consumer electronics. Walk Free will target industrial minerals which are mined from \u201csweat-shop style\u201d mines in West Africa, Forrest said. Fortescue\u2019s own suppliers had been asked to check their supply chains aren\u2019t inadvertently affected by slavery, though \u201cnot everyone could sign immediately\u201d he said.  Mine to Products  \u201cNo company can want to knowingly have so-called conflict minerals in its supply chains and products,\u201d Bennett Freeman, senior vice president for sustainability research and policy at Bethesda, Maryland-based Calvert Investment Management Inc., said by phone. \u201cResponsibility goes all the way from mine to the end products.\u201d  Walk Free is involved in several campaigns aimed at getting companies to seek to ensure they use supply chains free of forced labor. It had success with getting  Inditex SA (ITX) , the world\u2019s biggest clothing retailer, to join a pledge concerning the use of cotton picked in Uzbekistan, Forrest said.  Inditex, which is controlled by  Amancio Ortega , the world\u2019s fourth-richest person with $54.5 billion, confirmed in an e-mail that it joined the Responsible Sourcing Network\u2019s Cotton Campaign in October, adding it\u2019s been involved with both garments manufacturers and exporters and textile mills associations in a number of countries for some years.  Plant Visits  Walk Free is also campaigning for Nintendo Co., the world\u2019s largest maker of video machines, to ensure that its supply chain is free of conflict minerals, Forrest said. Nintendo supports the sourcing of conflict-free minerals and prohibits their production partners from using conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Kyoto-based company said in an emailed document. The company also visited the plants of production partners to be sure they weren\u2019t used, it said.  \u201cWhen it comes to changing attitudes we need a broad section of society,\u201d said Macquarie\u2019s McKeon, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1999, and temporarily paralyzed. The diagnosis spurred his charity work that has included counseling heroin addicts and chairing the  Global Poverty Project Inc . \u201cIf you\u2019ve got someone of Forrest\u2019s clout in the minerals industry, saying something\u2019s not right, it obviously has enormous impact.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Elisabeth Behrmann in Sydney at  ebehrmann1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jason Rogers at  jrogers73@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 13.35480785369873 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
