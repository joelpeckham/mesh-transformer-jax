 "context": "The following article called 'Bank Profit Growth Rises on Business Loans: Corporate Canada' was published on 2012-05-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanadian banks, including  Royal Bank\nof Canada (RY)  and Bank of Montreal, will post higher profit in the\nfiscal second quarter as a firming economy fueled loans to\nconsumers and businesses, analysts said.  The country\u2019s banks will boost earnings per share before\none-time items by an average of 5 percent in the period ended\nApril 30, said Sumit Malhotra, an analyst at Macquarie Capital\nMarkets in Toronto. That\u2019s up from a 1 percent increase on that\nbasis in the first quarter.  Bank of Montreal , the fourth-biggest\nbank by assets, reports results tomorrow.  Even as policy makers warned against the dangers of too\nmuch household debt, Canadians took advantage of record-low\n interest rates  to increase borrowing, bolstered by the largest\ntwo-month  employment  increase in more than 30 years.  \u201cLending isn\u2019t slowing down; lending is actually\naccelerating,\u201d  Barry Schwartz , a portfolio manager at Baskin\nFinancial Services Inc. in Toronto, said in an interview. Baskin\nmanages C$400 million ($392 million), including bank shares. \u201cI\nthink that\u2019s going to be a theme and a trend that\u2019s going to\ncontinue.\u201d  Canada \u2019s banks, ranked the world\u2019s soundest for the past\nfour years by the Geneva-based  World Economic Forum , reduced\n mortgage rates  to historic lows between January and March,\nprompting some consumers to take out fixed-rate loans at lower\nrates. Overall bank lending increased at an annualized pace of\n3.1 percent for the three months ended March 31, according to\nBrad Smith, an analyst at Stonecap Securities. That compares\nwith a trailing 12-month increase of 7 percent, he said.  Slowing But Growing  \u201cThe banks are slowing, but still growing,\u201d  Robert Sedran , an analyst at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, said in an\ninterview. \u201cWhile the growth rates are not eye-poppingly large,\nthere still is some progress being made.\u201d  Household debt driven by mortgage credit expansion is the\n\u201cmain threat\u201d to risk profiles of Canadian banks,  Fitch\nRatings  said yesterday in a report. The six largest banks had\nC$912 billion of exposure to residential mortgages and home\nequity lines of credit at the end of January, the ratings\ncompany said.  Net interest margin, the difference between what a bank\ncharges for loans and pays in deposits, will be flat to down for\nmost of the banks this quarter, according to a research note by\n Mario Mendonca , an analyst at Canaccord Genuity.  \u201cI don\u2019t think margins are going to collapse,\u201d Mendonca\nsaid in an interview. \u201cBut if there\u2019s one area I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m\nwrong, it\u2019s that the mortgage competition had a greater effect\nthan I expected.\u201d  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce \nare among lenders that have said they will slow the rate of\nexpense growth this year, expecting a decline from record levels\nof domestic consumer-bank earnings.  Bank of Montreal  \u201cThat\u2019s what the banks do,\u201d said  John Kinsey , who helps\nmanage about C$1 billion at Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto,\nin an interview. \u201cOther than raising fees, they cut costs\nthrough staffing in times like this.\u201d  Mendonca said the banks will also cut projects that don\u2019t\n\u201creally involve anyone who meets clients,\u201d such as\nadministrative systems and cross-selling projects.  The  Standard & Poor\u2019s/TSX Composite Commercial Banks\nIndustry Index (STCBNK)  that tracks Canada\u2019s eight traded banks has risen\nless than one percent this year, compared with a 3.8 percent\ndecline for the benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  is expected to post profit before items of\nC$1.35 a share, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier,\naccording to Malhotra.  RBC, TD  Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada\u2019s\ntwo largest banks, are scheduled to report May 24. Royal Bank\nmay have profit of C$1.20 a share, up from C$1.12 a year\nearlier, Malhotra said. Toronto-Dominion is expected to report\nprofit of C$1.82 a share, up from a year-earlier C$1.63.  Bank of Nova Scotia , the third-largest bank, is expected by\nMalhotra to have profit of C$1.16 a share when it releases\nresults May 29. That\u2019s down 4.9 percent from C$1.22 a year\nearlier.  CIBC and  National Bank of Canada , the fifth- and sixth-\nlargest banks, are scheduled to report results May 31. CIBC will\npost adjusted profit of C$1.88 a share, a 2.7 percent increase,\nwhile Montreal-based National Bank will post C$1.90 a share, a\n6.7 percent increase, according to Malhotra\u2019s estimates.  Laurentian Bank of Canada  and  Canadian Western Bank (CWB) , the\ntwo smallest banks of the group, are scheduled to report results\nJune 6 and 7. The two banks, as well as National Bank, are\nprojected to raise their quarterly dividends, according to\nBloomberg Dividend Forecasts.  \u201cThey feel that this year is going to be good enough that\nthey could raise the dividend and return that money to the\nshareholders,\u201d said Caldwell\u2019s Kinsey.
