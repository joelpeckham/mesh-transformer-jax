 "context": "The following article called 'Scab Check for Poultry to Be Scrapped Under Food-Safety Rule' was published on 2012-01-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. would boost monitoring of\npoultry processors\u2019 sanitary practices and contamination\ncontrols instead of eyeballing each bird for scabs and sores\nunder a plan that would save companies $250 million a year.  U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said the\nproposal, to be presented today, may prevent 5,200 foodborne\nillnesses a year by modernizing the century-old system and\nmaking it more efficient. The effort will emphasize safety,\nrather than the visual imperfections of chickens and turkeys\nthat may harm sales.  \u201cIt\u2019s obviously about safer food and fewer foodborne\nillnesses,\u201d Vilsack said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s also about\nreducing the cost of production in an effective way without\nredundancy or compromising safety.\u201d  The U.S. would save as much as $40 million a year within\ntwo or three years, in part through the elimination of\ngovernment inspection jobs, Vilsack said. Last week, the\nsecretary announced a reorganization of his agency that would\nlower spending by about $150 million a year, or 1 percent of the\ndepartment\u2019s budget. The public will have 90 days to comment on\nthe proposal.  The USDA would continue to inspect poultry carcasses at the\nend of the  production line  before they are chilled and will be\non site at all times, Vilsack said. Slaughter operators have the\noption of requesting the U.S. continue visual inspections for\nblemishes, according to the proposed regulation.  \u2018Historic\u2019 Change  \u201cThis is historic,\u201d said  Michael Osterholm , director of\nthe  Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy  at the\n University of Minnesota  in  Minneapolis , in an interview. \u201cIf\nyou really want to improve our poultry system, this is what you\nwould do. It\u2019s all about improving food safety. You can\u2019t see\nsalmonella.\u201d  The value of production from broilers, eggs and turkeys,\nand the sale of chickens was $34.7 billion in 2010, according to\nthe U.S. Poultry and Eggs Association website.  The USDA\u2019s proposal would bring efficiencies to the\ninspection system, said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for  Tyson\nFoods Inc. (TSN) , in an e-mail. Tyson, based in Springdale,  Arkansas ,\nand the largest U.S. chicken producer by volume, participated in\nthe pilot program testing the new inspection rules.  More Flexibility  \u201cThis modified system reduces redundancies between company\nand USDA inspection efforts and gives USDA\u2019s staff more\nflexibility to focus on other things that verify the\neffectiveness of our food safety activities,\u201d said Mickelson,\nadding that Tyson hasn\u2019t seen the proposed regulation.  U.S. efforts to inspect meat and poultry need to be\nimproved and driven by public health rather than budgetary\nconcerns, said  Michael Jacobson , executive director of the\nCenter for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington consumer\nadvocacy group, in an e-mail.  \u201cWhile the changes USDA proposes would save money, it is\ncritically important that they reduce the unacceptably high\nlevels of salmonella and campylobacter in chicken and turkey,\u201d\nJacobson said.  The pilot program with 25 poultry processors conducted over\nmore than a decade found no increased risk of injuries to\nworkers from the faster production line and showed the effort to\nbe successful, said Elisabeth Hagen, undersecretary for  food\nsafety  at the USDA, in an interview.  Outstanding Performance  \u201cThe continued outstanding performance of plants\nparticipating in the pilot program justifies the USDA\u2019s\nconfidence in announcing this proposed rule,\u201d according to\njoint statement to be released today by the  National Chicken\nCouncil  and the  National Turkey Federation , both in Washington.  The change would speed up the inspection timeline to 175\nchickens per minute from 140, and to 50 turkeys from 45 a\nminute.  The agency expects to save $15 million in the first year of\nimplementation, mainly through lower labor costs, Vilsack said.\nFive hundred to 800 inspector positions along with 140\nsupervisory jobs will be eliminated in large part through\nattrition and retirement, he said.  More Training  About 1,500 U.S. inspectors will receive training, as well\nas position and pay upgrades, to handle the other oversight\nactivities, including monitoring companies\u2019 sanitization plans,\ntemperature controls and surveying points in the process where\ncontamination may occur or be detected.  Devoting resources to inspection activities off the\nassembly line reflects a growing body of science on how\nfoodborne illness is best prevented, said J. Glenn Morris Jr.,\ndirector of the  Emerging Pathogens Institute  at the University\nof  Florida  in Gainesville.  \u201cYou can\u2019t see or feel a bad bacteria on a bad chicken,\u201d\nsaid Morris in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way you detect\nmajor problems. Looking at chickens does not solve your food\nsafety problems.\u201d  Inspectors began visually inspecting poultry for physical\ndefects in 1906, before it was possible to detect microbial\ncontamination that can\u2019t be seen and poses a hazard, he said.  The  U.S. Poultry & Egg Association , which represents\nproducers and processors and is based in Tucker,  Georgia ,\ndeclined to comment until the proposal is released today, said\nGwen Venable, a spokeswoman, in an interview.  Poultry slaughter operations would also have to develop\nwritten procedures to prevent contamination and a program to\ncontrol sanitation, as well as sampling and analysis. Such\nguidelines are currently voluntary.
