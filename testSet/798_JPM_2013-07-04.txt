The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTom Hayes, the former  UBS AG (UBSN)  and\n Citigroup Inc. (C)  trader, is scheduled to enter a plea on charges\nrelated to manipulation of the London interbank offered rate\nlater this year.  Hayes, 33, was told by a judge in London today to enter a\nplea at a hearing in late October. Wearing a black suit and\nwhite button-down shirt without a tie, he spoke only to confirm\nhis name. Prosecutors at the  Serious Fraud Office  agreed to give\nhim more information on their case by Sept. 30.  \u201cThe documentation in this case, to describe it as\nvoluminous would be a large understatement,\u201d said Mukul Chawla,\na lawyer for the SFO.  Hayes, who remains on bail, is charged with working with\nemployees at JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Royal Bank of Scotland Group\nPlc , HSBC Holdings Plc, Rabobank Groep and Deutsche Bank AG, as\nwell as Tullett Prebon Plc, ICAP Plc and RP Martin Holdings\nLtd., over a four-year period to manipulate yen Libor rates.  At his first court appearance last month, Hayes\u2019s lawyer,\nLydia Jonson, declined to indicate how he would plead when asked\nby a judge.  Four of the charges cover the period from Aug. 8, 2006,\nuntil Dec. 3, 2009, while he worked at UBS, and the other four\nfrom Dec. 1, 2009 until Sept. 7, 2010, when he was at Citigroup.  Hayes tried to manipulate rates \u201cwith the intention that\nthe economic interests of others would be prejudiced and/or to\nmake personal gain for themselves or another,\u201d the SFO said in\nthe indictment.  Hayes has also been charged by the U.S. Justice Department,\nwhich is running a parallel criminal investigation.
