 "context": "The following article called 'Banks Best Basel as Global Regulators Dilute or Postpone New Capital Rules' was published on 2010-12-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMore than 500 representatives from\n27 nations, including top regulators and central bankers, met\ndozens of times this year to hammer out 440 pages of new rules\nto govern the world\u2019s banks.  What\u2019s not in the documents published by the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision, and the escape hatches that\nare, may have more impact on how financial institutions will\noperate following a global credit crisis that led to $1.8\ntrillion in bank losses and writedowns.  The committee\u2019s most significant achievement, members say,\nan agreement to increase the amount of capital banks need to\nhold, won\u2019t go into full effect for eight years. Other measures\nthat regulators had hoped would prevent future crises --\nliquidity standards, a capital surcharge on the biggest lenders\nand a global resolution mechanism for failing firms -- were\npostponed, allowing banks to escape the toughest rules that\nwould force them to change the way they do business.  \u201cThere will be changes, but not fundamental changes to the\nbanking model,\u201d said  Sheila Bair , who as chairman of the U.S.\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. sits on the Basel committee\u2019s\ntop decision-making body. \u201cHopefully there\u2019ll be some pressure\nfor banks to get smaller and simpler.\u201d  Bair, 56, is one of five U.S. representatives on the board.\nShe has assailed bankers for exaggerating the impact of planned\nregulations in an effort to scare the public and politicians. In\nan interview in June, she questioned \u201cwhether regulators can\nplace any reliance on industry analysis of the impact of\nproposals to strengthen capital rules.\u201d  Bank Lobbying  Banks carried out a yearlong campaign to blunt\ninternational regulations, arguing that efforts to rein them in\nwould curb lending and impede economic recovery. The lobbying\neffort was led by the  Institute of International Finance , which\nrepresents more than 400 financial firms around the world and is\nchaired by  Josef Ackermann , Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s chief executive\nofficer. Ackermann and other IIF members wrote hundreds of\nletters to the Basel committee, met with regulators and\naddressed forums from Seoul to Washington.  In June, the group published a report estimating that the\nproposed capital rules would result in 9.7 million fewer jobs\nbeing created and erase 3.1 percent of global economic growth --\nestimates the Basel committee later challenged.  \u201cThere is no question that increased costs to banks of\ncore capital and funding will have to be largely passed along,\nwhich inevitably will take a macroeconomic toll,\u201d Ackermann,\n62, said when he presented the report.  Battle Lines  Banks also reached out to their home regulators, arguing\nthat some rules would disadvantage them more than other nations\u2019\nlenders. That helped draw the battle lines inside the Basel\ncommittee, according to an account pieced together from\ninterviews with half a dozen members who asked not to be\nidentified because the deliberations aren\u2019t public. Germany,\nFrance and Japan led the push for softening rules proposed last\nDecember and stretching out their implementation. The U.S., U.K.\nand Switzerland opposed changes or delays.  The committee agreed in July to narrow the definition of\nwhat counts as bank capital, focusing on common equity, which\nincludes money received for selling shares and retained\nearnings. During the crisis, other forms of capital permitted\nunder current rules, such as future benefits from servicing\nmortgages and tax deferrals, failed to provide a buffer against\nlosses. Those are mostly disallowed under Basel III, as the\nrules published last week are known.  Canada Switch  The capital requirements might have been stricter had it\nnot been for Greece. Escalating concern that the country\nwouldn\u2019t be able to service its debt, culminating in a May\nbailout by the European Union and a $1 trillion rescue package\nfor other member states that may need it, darkened prospects for\neconomic recovery. That led some committee members to bend to\nbank pressure, according to policy makers, central bankers and\nothers involved in the process.  By September, when the committee met to set the actual\ncapital ratios, the U.S. was pushing to require that banks have\ncommon equity equal to 8 percent of their risk-weighted assets,\nmembers said. It ended up at 7 percent, after Canada switched\nsides at the meeting, tipping the balance toward the German\ncamp. Canada\u2019s banks pressed their regulators to lower the ratio\nbecause they said they would be punished unfairly as healthy\nlenders that survived the crisis unscathed, the members said.  Even after being weakened, the new ratios and definitions\nwould require banks to hold about $800 billion more capital, the\ncommittee said last week. Most lenders will be able to raise the\nmoney by retaining profits before the rules go into effect.  Leverage Ratio  In addition to pushing for a higher capital ratio, Bair\nalso argued for a global  leverage ratio  that would cap banks\u2019\nborrowing -- something the U.S. has had on its books since the\n1980s. In July, when the committee was debating how to define\ncapital, the U.S. agreed to some easing in exchange for Germany\nand France accepting a leverage ratio, some members said.  Proponents of the leverage ratio, or equity as a percentage\nof liabilities, say it\u2019s a more straightforward way to prevent\nlenders from becoming too indebted. Unlike capital ratios, which\nare based on risk-weighting and can be manipulated, the leverage\nratio counts all assets regardless of their risk.  The more bankers borrow the more they can maximize profit\nper share, a yardstick for determining compensation. The more\nthey borrow the higher the risk that a small decline in asset\nprices can wipe out equity and make the bank insolvent.  No Correlation  The Basel committee adopted a 3 percent leverage rule in\nJuly, meaning that for every $3 of capital, a bank can borrow no\nmore than $97. While the percentage is tentative and subject to\nreview before it goes into effect, it has since come under\nattack by banks in Europe and Asia, which say it will restrict\ntheir borrowing capacity and inhibit lending.  The EU may exclude the leverage ratio when it converts\nBasel rules into law next year. Several member nations have\nadvocated dropping the rule, people close to the discussions\nsaid last month. A majority of the 27 EU countries oppose\nadopting the ratio, these people said.  \u201cThe argument is that this will restrain lending -- I hope\nour colleagues in Europe don\u2019t buy into this,\u201d Bair said in an\ninterview earlier this month.  Recent academic research supports Bair. A July  paper  by\n Jeremy Stein , a professor of economics at Harvard University,\nand two colleagues looked at data going back to the 1920s and\nfound no correlation between higher capital ratios and costlier\nlending by banks. An October paper by  Anat Admati  and three\nother professors at Stanford University concluded that increased\nequity levels don\u2019t  restrict  lending.  \u2018Continuing Bickering\u2019  \u201cIn the long run, higher capital has small impact on\nlending,\u201d said Stein in an interview. \u201cBut banks don\u2019t like to\ngo out and get it. And regulators bought the banks\u2019 arguments on\nthis. They could have been tougher.\u201d  Bair, who first advocated the idea of an international\nleverage ratio in a speech to committee members in Merida,\nMexico, in 2006, said she still expects global adoption.  Barbara Matthews , managing director of BCM International\nRegulatory Analytics LLC, a Washington-based company that\nadvises on financial regulation, said the leverage ratio may not\nmake it in the end.  \u201cBeyond tightening the definition of capital, nothing can\nbe really counted as having been achieved,\u201d Matthews, a former\nbank lobbyist, said of the Basel committee\u2019s work this year.\n\u201cThere\u2019s continuing bickering over liquidity and leverage\nregimes. They\u2019re still studying too-big-to-fail issues, and it\nmight be too late to finalize them as events take them over.\u201d  $6 Trillion  The Basel committee, established in 1974, proposed its\nfirst liquidity standard, which would require banks to hold\nenough cash or easily cashable assets to meet their liabilities\nfor up to a year. Running out of cash was behind the 2008\ncollapse of Bear Stearns Cos. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.\nin the U.S. and Northern Rock Plc in the U.K.  After banks showed they\u2019d have to raise as much as $6\ntrillion in new long-term debt to be in compliance, the\ncommittee delayed a final decision on the rule, setting up an\n\u201cobservation period\u201d of four to six years. It will likely be\nrevised, according to members.  \u201cLiquidity is very important and still an outstanding\nissue,\u201d said  Douglas Elliott , an economics fellow at the\nWashington-based Brookings Institution and a former JPMorgan\nChase & Co. banker. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to do it in the next couple\nof years, but it could take many more years. Or it might never\nget done if it proves too contentious.\u201d  Resolution Mechanism  Lehman\u2019s collapse also showed the need for a cross-border\nmechanism to wind down failing banks that have a global reach.\nMore than 80 proceedings against the firm, involving hundreds of\nsubsidiaries worldwide, have complicated recovery by creditors\nand destroyed much of the value of its assets.  The  Financial Stability Board , which includes most Basel\ncommittee members as well as finance ministers from the Group of\n20 nations, struggled to come up with such a resolution\nmechanism this year. The FSB postponed a decision until next\nyear after divisions among nations proved too wide to bridge,\nmembers said. The group has been unable to agree on how to\ndistribute losses among countries when a global bank fails and\nhow different legal jurisdictions can recognize a single\nauthority to pay creditors, the members said.  Too Big to Fail  The FSB is also responsible for determining which banks are\nsystemically important and whether to impose additional capital\nrequirements on them. The group may propose setting up national\nresolution authorities, rather than an international body,\nmembers said. Instead of a global accord on a surcharge for the\nlargest banks, it may suggest a menu of options.  \u201cNobody\u2019s been able to fix too-big-to-fail around the\nworld because nobody knows how to do it,\u201d said  Hal Scott , a\nHarvard Law School professor who also is director of the\nCommittee on Capital Markets Regulation, a nonpartisan group of\nacademics and business executives. \u201cEven figuring out how to\nresolve giant banks nationally is tough. How can you do it\ninternationally? That was the biggest lesson of the crisis,\nsystemic risk, but that\u2019s still unresolved.\u201d  Many issues may never be resolved, said  Frederick Cannon ,\nco-director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. in New\nYork, a firm that specializes in financial companies.  G-20 \nleaders meeting in Seoul last month sounded as if they were\nclaiming victory for regulatory reforms, even if they weren\u2019t\ncompleted, Cannon said.  \u201cBefore Seoul, I was expecting more reforms to be\nconcluded next year,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now, more and more, I\nbelieve this is what we\u2019re getting, nothing more. They got a 7\npercent common equity requirement -- the rest is all uncertain\nto ever happen.\u201d  \u2018Glass Half Full\u2019  Charles Goodhart , a former Bank of England policy maker and\nprofessor at the London School of Economics, said he is more\noptimistic that differences will be resolved in coming years.  \u201cThere is still lots to be done, but we haven\u2019t lost the\nmomentum,\u201d Goodhart said. \u201cWe\u2019re 50 percent of the way there.\nWe need to see it as the glass half full.\u201d  Bair, who is stepping down from her FDIC position when her\nterm expires in June, said she hopes the reforms will continue\nafter she leaves the Basel committee. One remaining challenge,\nshe said, is the reliance on banks\u2019 internal models for\nmeasuring risk.  While smaller banks use standard risk-weightings prescribed\nby Basel, the largest banks use their own formulas to determine\nhow much risk to assign their assets in calculating capital\nratios. That leads to wide variations in how risk-weighted\nassets are tallied, Bair said.  \u201cWe have to get beyond too much reliance on banks\u2019\ninternal models, their own views on risk,\u201d she said.
