 "context": "The following article called 'Banks Push Fed to Curb Borrowers' Right to Rescind Mortgages' was published on 2010-12-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMortgage firms are pressing the\nFederal Reserve to curb homeowners\u2019 right to invalidate loans\nbased on flawed documents -- a right consumer groups say is one\nof the few weapons borrowers have to battle unfair lending.  Consumer groups and industry lawyers say a rule under\nconsideration by the central bank would make it harder for\nborrowers to exercise their right of \u201crescission,\u201d which\nforces a lender to relinquish a lien on a mortgaged property.\nThey said the number of rescissions has grown in recent years as\na result of the  foreclosure crisis  and allegations that mortgage\ndocuments were fabricated or processed improperly.  Ken Markison, regulatory counsel at the Mortgage Bankers\nAssociation, said the change would save lenders money. \u201cGreater\nclarity will help avoid unnecessary litigation and reduce\ncosts,\u201d Markison said.  Wells Fargo & Co. , Bank of America Corp., and JPMorgan\nChase & Co., the three largest U.S. mortgage lenders, all\ndeclined to discuss rescissions or didn\u2019t respond to requests\nfor comment.  Susan Stawick , a Fed spokeswoman, also declined to\ncomment.  Lenders are pressing the Federal Reserve to act on the\nissue now because starting in July, rescission rules will come\nunder the purview of the new Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau, industry lawyers said.  Jeffrey Naimon , a lawyer with\nBuckley Sandler LLP, described the consumer agency in an e-mail\nas \u201ca much more political\u201d regulator than the Fed.  Fed \u2018Rushing\u2019  Since the financial crisis began, the Fed has come under\ncriticism for having failed to meet its existing legal mandate\nto protect consumers from deceptive mortgages and other\nfinancial products. That track record was one reason behind\nCongress\u2019s push to create an independent consumer agency.  \u201cI cannot understand why the Fed is rushing through this\nvoluntary gift to the banks unless the Fed is afraid that if it\ndoesn\u2019t curtail the rights of rescission now, it will never\nhappen,\u201d said Kathleen Engel, a professor at Suffolk University\nLaw School in Boston.  The right of rescission was established by the 1968 Truth\nin Lending Act. Borrowers who can show a material misstatement\nin loan documents have three years to issue a rescission notice\nto the lender, who must revoke its lien on the property.  Consumer and industry lawyers said rescissions have risen\nbecause of fallout from the collapse of the housing bubble,\nalthough precise numbers are hard to come by.  Kathleen Day , a\nspokeswoman for the Center for Responsible Lending, estimated\nthat there are \u201cthousands\u201d of rescission cases pending in\njurisdictions around the country; by contrast, the Federal\nReserve estimated that there will be 2.25 million foreclosure\nfilings this year.  Forced Modification  Borrowers usually exercise the right of rescission during a\nforeclosure or other legal proceedings, effectively forcing a\nloan modification. The borrower seeks a new lender, the original\nlender returns interest and fees, and the principal is repaid by\nthe second lender.  \u201cIt is ultimately the biggest hammer in the toolkit for a\nlawyer helping someone to save their home,\u201d said  Ira Rheingold ,\nexecutive director of the National Association of Consumer\nAdvocates.  The Fed issued the proposed regulation on Sept. 24 as part\nof an update of truth-in-lending rules, and asked for public\ncomment by Dec. 23. The  Fed filing  said the new rules are part\nof an ongoing review of truth-in-lending rules that has been\nproceeding for years, and would \u201creduce uncertainty and\nlitigation costs.\u201d  \u201cThe Board does not believe that Congress intended for the\ncreditor to lose its status as a secured creditor if the\nconsumer does not return the loan balance,\u201d the Fed wrote.  Compliance Burden  The Fed filings noted that rescissions are sometimes based\non technicalities, such as providing only one copy of a\ndisclosure instead of two. The goal of the new rule is to\n\u201creduce undue compliance burden and litigation risk for\ncreditors,\u201d the Fed said, while improving \u201cthe clarity and\nusefulness of disclosures for the consumer\u2019s right to rescind.\u201d  Day of the Center for Responsible Lending called the\nproposed curbs an \u201cindustry-friendly move\u201d that contradicts\nthe Obama administration\u2019s goal of minimizing foreclosures.  \u201cIt runs at cross purposes with any effort to bring people\nto the table,\u201d Day said in an interview.  At a mid-October meeting of the Fed\u2019s Consumer Advisory\nCouncil, an external advisory group, consumer groups expressed\nopposition to the change. At the meeting, Governor  Daniel Tarullo  signaled that he opposed the proposed rescission rule,\naccording to two people present. Tarullo declined requests for\ncomment.  Consumer Bureau  Two members of the advisory council, who asked that they\nnot be identified because the discussions were private, said\nthey brought the dispute to the attention of  Elizabeth Warren ,\nthe special adviser to President  Barack Obama  charged with\nsetting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau\nwill take over responsibility for truth-in-lending regulations\nwhen it begins operations after July 21.  A coalition of consumer and civil rights groups, including\nConsumers Union and the NAACP, sent a letter to the Fed on Nov.\n16 asking the central bank to hold off on updating truth-in-\nlending regulations until the CFPB starts work.  Naimon , the lawyer with Buckley Sandler who represents\nlenders, said that waiting for the CFPB would \u201cresult in years\nof additional delay.\u201d  Rescissions add \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d to the cost of a\nforeclosure process because a bank has to hire a local law firm\nto manage the litigation, he said. That legal work \u201ccan\u2019t just\nbe done from headquarters.\u201d  Potent Tool  With credit markets tight, lenders have become less willing\nto issue new mortgages, so rescissions have become a potent tool\nfor consumers seeking a loan modification, said  Robert Cook , a\nHanover, Maryland-based attorney with the firm Hudson Cook LLP.\nLenders lose the security on the mortgage -- the home itself --\neffectively becoming unsecured creditors.  \u201cThe conventional wisdom, which I think is correct, is\nthat rescissions rise as the economy falls,\u201d Cook said.  The private securitization of mortgages, rare when the\nlending act was passed in 1968, has imposed additional costs.\nUnder the law, Cook said, the trustee of a pool of privately\nsecuritized mortgages can pull the rescinded mortgage out and\nforce the issuer to buy it back.  The Fed proposal would require borrowers to tender the full\nloan principal before the creditor relinquishes the lien, a\nchange that would \u201ceviscerate the single most effective tool\nthat homeowners have to stop foreclosures,\u201d the consumer groups\nwrote in their letter.  Naimon argued that rescissions are a \u201close/lose\nproposition\u201d because they are \u201coften a frivolous claim\u201d and\nno money will be paid to consumers, but rather to lawyers for\nmortgage bankers.
