 "context": "The following article called 'Existing U.S. Home Sales Decline as Supply Drops' was published on 2012-10-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSales of previously owned U.S. homes\ndecreased in September from the highest level in two years,\nrestrained by a lack of supply that may keep pushing prices up.  Purchases fell 1.7 percent to a 4.75 million annual rate,\nmatching the median forecast of economists surveyed by\nBloomberg, figures from the National Association of Realtors\nshowed today in  Washington . The median price from a year earlier\njumped by the most since 2005 as inventories dwindled.  The number of existing homes for sale is drying up as\ndemand improves,  hedge funds  snap up foreclosed properties to\nrent out and owners remain reluctant to sell until prices rise\nfurther. Mortgages rates driven to record lows by Federal\nReserve stimulus, along with a falling jobless rate, indicate\nsales will keep improving.  \u201cThere are a lot of reasons to be positive on housing,\u201d\nsaid Tom Simons, an economist at Jefferies Group Inc. in  New\nYork , who correctly projected the drop. \u201c Mortgage rates  are\nnear all-time lows, and inventories are at generational lows. If\nhousing prices continue to rise, people are incentivized to get\noff the sidelines. It all sets up for continued improvement.\u201d  Stocks fell, giving benchmark indexes their biggest\ndeclines since June, as results from Microsoft Corp. and General\nElectric Co. missed estimates. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\ndropped 1.7 percent to 1,433.19 at the close in New York.\n Treasury securities  rose, sending the yield on the benchmark 10-\nyear note down to 1.77 percent from 1.83 percent late yesterday.  Economists\u2019 Estimates  The  median  forecast was based on a Bloomberg survey of 78\neconomists. Estimates ranged from 4.53 million to 4.9 million.\nThe prior month\u2019s pace was revised to 4.83 million from a\npreviously reported 4.82 million. Those were the strongest back-\nto-back readings since mid 2010, when the government\u2019s first-\ntime buyer credit lapsed.  The  median price  of an existing home climbed to $183,900,\nup 11.3 percent from September 2011. That was the biggest year-\nover-year gain since November 2005.  Compared with a year earlier, purchases increased 11\npercent.  The number of previously owned homes  on the market  dropped\n3.3 percent to 2.32 million, the fewest for any September since\n2002. At the current sales pace, it would take 5.9 months to\nsell those houses compared with 6 months at the end of August.\nThe months\u2019 supply was the lowest since March 2006.  Home Supply  The market is now heading into a traditionally weak period\nfor inventory, indicating the months\u2019 supply may drop to the 5-\nmonth area in the December-to-February time frame,  Lawrence Yun ,\nNAR chief economist, said in a news conference as the figures\nwere released.  \u201cCertainly we have broken out of the slump,\u201d Yun said.\n\u201cPrices are now showing an accelerating trend. This is a\nreflection of low inventory. Builders need to increase\nproduction.\u201d  In September, Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  called housing\n\u201cone of the missing pistons in the engine\u201d as he announced the\nthird round of large-scale asset purchases intended to push down\nlong-term  interest rates  and spur growth.  The lower borrowing costs are bolstering home demand, even\nas tighter credit standards make it harder for many Americans to\nget a mortgage. The  average rate  on a 30-year fixed loan was\n3.37 percent in the week ended Oct. 18, near a record-low of\n3.36 reported Oct. 4, according to data from  Freddie Mac  that\ndates back to 1971.  Distressed Properties  Distressed homes, which include foreclosures and short\nsales, in which the lender agrees to a transaction for less than\nthe balance of the mortgage, accounted for 24 percent of the\nSeptember total, up from 22 percent in the prior month, today\u2019s\nreport showed.  All-cash transactions accounted for 28 percent of last\nmonth\u2019s sales, and investors, the majority of who are all-cash\nbuyers, accounted for 18 percent.  Private-equity firms such as Colony Capital LLC and\nBlackstone Group LP, have converged on Phoenix, Atlanta and\nother distressed areas in search of low-priced properties to buy\nand rent out, helping to stabilize the markets. These types of\ninvestors have raised as much as $8 billion to buy as many as\n80,000 single-family homes to manage as rentals, according to a\nSept. 21 report by Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.  American households may also be drawn into the market as a\nfalling jobless rate helps bolster confidence. Unemployment\ndropped to 7.8 percent in September, the lowest since President\n Barack Obama  took office in January 2009. The Bloomberg Consumer\nComfort Index last week climbed to a six-month high, and a\nsimilar measure from Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan\njumped this month to a five-year high.  Battleground States  Ohio was among six of eight states considered U.S.\npresidential election battlegrounds that showed a September drop\nin unemployment, according to Labor Department data issued today\nless than three weeks before voters head to the polls.  The jobless rate in Ohio declined to 7 percent from 7.2\npercent in August. Unemployment also fell in  Wisconsin ,\n Colorado ,  Florida ,  Iowa  and  Nevada . The rate was unchanged from\nAugust in  New Hampshire  and  Virginia . Joblessness in five of the\nstates is less than the national average.  Today\u2019s report from the Realtors\u2019 group showed sales\ndropped in three of four regions, led by a 6.3 percent decrease\nin the Northeast. Demand rose 0.5 percent in the South.  Construction companies are showing an improvement in\nearnings as the market turns. Miami-based  Lennar Corp. (LEN) , the\nthird-largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue, said its third-\nquarter profit more than quadrupled as revenue climbed.  Builder Optimism  \u201cOverall demand has been improving and we\u2019ve seen a\nconsistent sales pace at improving prices,\u201d Chief Executive\nOfficer  Stuart Miller  said on a Sept. 24 conference call with\nanalysts. \u201cThe homebuilding business is beginning to revert to\nnormal and that\u2019s positive for the  U.S. economy  in general.\u201d  Existing-home sales have improved after reaching a low of a\n3.39 million annual rate in July 2010. In the buildup to the\nsubprime lending collapse and recession, purchases reached a\npeak of 7.25 million in September 2005.  Other reports signal that housing is on the mend. Home\nstarts surged 15 percent in September to an 872,000 annual rate,\nthe fastest since July 2008, according to Commerce Department\ndata released this week. An increase in building permits\nsignaled the gains will be sustained.  Construction companies are less pessimistic. The National\nAssociation of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index\nincreased to 41 this month, the highest since June 2006 and the\nsixth straight gain. Still, readings below 50 mean more\nrespondents said conditions were poor.  Demand for  new homes , another harbinger of progress, may\nhave climbed to a two-year high in September, according to\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg. The report is due on Oct. 24\nfrom the Commerce Department.
