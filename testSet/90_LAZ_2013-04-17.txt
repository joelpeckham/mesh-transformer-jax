 "context": "The following article called 'Philadelphia Bars Public From Mayor\u2019s Investor Meeting' was published on 2013-04-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPhiladelphia Mayor Michael Nutter,\nwhose municipality has the lowest credit rating of the five\nmost-populous U.S. cities, will address investors at a\nconference financed by underwriters and closed to the public and\nthe press.  The invitation bills tomorrow\u2019s meeting as a chance to hear\n\u201cPhiladelphia leaders and investors discuss building the city\u2019s\nfuture.\u201d In addition to Nutter, a 55-year-old Democrat,\n speakers  will include finance director Rob Dubow and Mark Gale,\nchief executive officer of Philadelphia International Airport,\naccording to the agenda.  Philadelphia is hoping to attract investors for the city,\nwhich is rated three steps above junk by Standard & Poor\u2019s. The\ncity and its authorities have $8.75 billion in outstanding debt\nas of September, according to bond documents. Philadelphia\u2019s\npension system is 47.6 percent funded this year, the documents\nsay.  Tours of city assets are set for the second day of the\nconference, including the Philadelphia Gas Works, the largest\nmunicipally owned natural-gas utility in the U.S. The city plans\nto hire a broker to steer the sale of the system, which may\nfetch as much as $496 million, according to  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)   \u201cIt is a private meeting,\u201d said Mark McDonald, a\nspokesman for Nutter. Underwriters pledged to cover the $8,500\ncost of the conference, he said by telephone. McDonald said the\ndonors will be made public when the city receives the full\namount.  City\u2019s Underwriters  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and Jefferies & Co. were underwriters of\nthe city\u2019s $127 million tax- and revenue-anticipation notes\noffered in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Citigroup Inc.,\nSiebert Branford Shank & Co. LLC, Samuel A. Ramirez & Co., Loop\nCapital Markets LLC and Janney Montgomery Scott LLC have also\nserved as underwriters, according to the city\u2019s  website .  Bloomberg News wrote Nutter April 4 objecting to the\npress\u2019s exclusion from the conference. The Associated Press, the\nPhiladelphia Inquirer, and the Arlington, Virginia-based\nnonprofit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press have\nsupported the protest.  Philadelphia, where more than a quarter of the population\nof 1.5 million lives in poverty, carries ratings by the three\nmajor companies that are the lowest for the top five most\npopulous cities. It\u2019s rated BBB+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s, three\nsteps above noninvestment grade. Fitch Ratings puts it one step\nhigher, at A-, while Moody\u2019s Investors Service ranks it two\nlevels higher, at A2.  \u2018Some Concern\u2019  Sam Katz, chairman of the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental\nCooperation Authority, created in a 1991 state law that oversees\nthe city\u2019s finances, said that with the conference being held\nlocally, it \u201ccertainly created some concern on the part of\npeople that it should be made public.\u201d  He\u2019s more troubled, however, by the fact the school\ndistrict isn\u2019t on the agenda, he said. Facing a $304 million\ndeficit, school officials have  asked  the city for $60 million\nand the state for $120 million.  \u201cThe school district\u2019s in a crisis,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThey\u2019re\nthe same tax base.\u201d  Philadelphia officials facing a $1.35 billion spending gap\nover five years voted in March to shut 9 percent of its public\nschools.  Philadelphia entered into $3.5 billion of swaps, and its\nborrowing cost may swell by as much as $186 million compared\nwith what it would\u2019ve paid to issue fixed-rate debt, estimated\ncity treasurer Nancy Winkler in October. The city is lobbying to\nmaintain its ability to engage in the transactions after a bill\nthat would ban the practice for municipalities was introduced in\nthe state legislature in February.
