 "context": "The following article called 'Starbucks Pastor-to-Be Shows Shift in U.S. Part-Time Job Market' was published on 2013-08-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJoseph Peterson grew up wanting to\nbe a pastor, just like his dad. A part-time job at  Starbucks\nCorp. (SBUX)  is allowing him to pursue his dream.  His barista\u2019s salary is supporting him and his wife,\nNicole, while he studies for a divinity degree at Baptist Bible\nSeminary in Clarks Summit,  Pennsylvania . \u201cI\u2019d rather get my\nschooling done now, when it\u2019s just the two of us and our cost of\nliving isn\u2019t very high,\u201d said Peterson.  Peterson, 24, is among a growing number of people who are\nworking part-time because they want to, and not because the\nsluggish economy forces them to settle for less than a full-time\njob. That\u2019s a reversal of what happened during the recession and\nthe first years of the recovery. It shows a labor market in the\nearly stages of a shift toward more full-time employment choices\nrather than just low-paying, part-time positions such as coffee\nservers, say economists including Neil Dutta and  Ethan Harris .  \u201cIf it\u2019s a non-economic reason, it\u2019s basically an\nindividual choice,\u201d said Dutta, head of U.S. economics at\nRenaissance Macro Research LLC in  New York . \u201cWhichever way you\nlook at the labor market, information suggests to me a largely\ncyclical weakness. It\u2019s way too early to say that there\u2019s some\nstructural break.\u201d  Since the end of 2010, the number of people working less\nthan 35 hours a week for  non-economic reasons , including\nchild care and family obligations or school, has climbed 4.6\npercent to 19.1 million, according to Labor Department data.\nThose citing a  slack economy  or inability to find full-time jobs\ndropped by 7.7 percent over the same period to 8.25 million.  Part-Time Growth  So far, part-time hiring is still growing faster than the\ntotal job market. The 1.2 percent gain in hiring at an\nannualized rate so far this year has been paced by a 4.6 percent\nincrease among those working less than 35 hours. As a result,\npart-time workers accounted for 19.6 percent of all employment\nin July, little changed from a record 20 percent in January\n2010.  An improving economy means the job market will soon reach a\ntipping point, where employers will need to offer more hours and\nbetter pay to attract qualified applicants, according to Harris,\nco-head of global economics research at Bank of America Corp. in\nNew York.  Some of those jobs will be filled by part-time workers who\nhave been searching for full-time work, such as Frank Avila, 27,\nwho starts a full-time job next week as an administrative\nassistant in Conroe,  Texas , at the supermarket chain H-E-B. He\u2019d\nbeen working part-time at a different location for about a year\nafter moving from  California  in August 2012.  Playing Money  \u201cIt\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t able to pay any of my bills,\u201d\nAvila said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any playing money. Everything was\ngoing to the bills and rent.\u2019  He said he hopes to use the extra money from his new job to\nhelp pay off credit-card debt and eventually buy a house.\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited. I feel a weight lifted off my shoulders.\u201d  About two-thirds of the increase in part-time jobs can be\ntraced to the so-called cyclical influences of the recession and\nensuing slow expansion, when out-of-work Americans had little\nbargaining power and companies had the upper hand in dictating\nwhat type of employment was available, said Harris, a former\nresearcher at the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  \u201cWhen you get a full recovery in the job market and\nworkers can pick and choose their jobs, people will not be\nwilling to take those jobs and the companies that are offering\nthem will have to switch over to full-time,\u201d Harris said.  GDP Growth  He projects gross domestic product will expand at a 3\npercent clip in the first half of 2014, prompting employers to\ntake on more full-timers. The economy grew at a 2.5 percent\nannualized pace from April through June, more than previously\nforecast, according to revised figures from the Commerce\nDepartment issued today in  Washington .  Peterson, the pastor-in-training, is already being pursued\nby churches willing to put him in the pulpit.  \u201cWe\u2019ve actually had a few offers to go to a church and\nhave a full-time position, but they wouldn\u2019t necessarily pay for\nschool,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cI\u2019d be doing my job and having a wife\nand probably a family and still having to go out-of-pocket for\nschool.\u201d  Peterson said he hopes to get his degree by the end of 2014\nand then search for a full-time position, potentially in the\nCarolinas where Nicole has family.  Not all economists agree the jump in part-time hiring will\nprove fleeting.  Structural Shift  \u201cI think it\u2019s a structural shift,\u201d said  John Silvia ,\nchief economist at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in  Charlotte ,\n North Carolina , and a former chief economist for the Senate\nBanking Committee. \u201cFirms have learned to use part-time people\nmore effectively.\u201d  The industries that have led the gains in employment,\nincluding  retailing , leisure and hospitality and temporary-help\nagencies, tend to use fewer full-time workers, and those trends\nwill probably continue, he said.  The record share of part-timers in the workforce at the\nstart of 2010 is less startling when adjusted for a 1994 change\nin the way the figures were calculated, according to  researchers \nat the  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco .  Starting in January of that year, all Americans were asked\nhow long they worked each week, and those saying less than 35\nhours were put in the part-time category, causing their numbers\nto surge. Previously, people who identified themselves as full-timers weren\u2019t asked about the number of hours they worked.  1980s Recessions  After prior years\u2019 numbers were adjusted to the new\ndefinition, they showed the part-time share of employment\nactually peaked at 20.3 percent in 1983, following the back-to-back recessions in the early 1980s,  San Francisco  Fed\nresearchers Rob Valletta and Leila Bengali wrote in an Aug. 26\neconomic letter.  \u201cBy this standard, the level of part-time work in recent\nyears is not unprecedented, although its persistence during the\nongoing recovery is unusual,\u201d they said.  Valletta and Bengali conclude \u201cthat the continued high\nincidence of individuals working part time for economic reasons\nreflects a slow recovery of the jobs lost during the recession\nrather than permanent changes in the proportion of part-time\njobs.\u201d  The prevalence of part-time work is making it difficult for\nFed policy makers to gauge the strength of the job market as\nthey decide when to scale back monetary stimulus and increase\nthe benchmark  interest rate . Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has said\nthey may soon start trimming the $85 billion a month in bond\npurchases and will aim to stop the program by mid-2014 when they\nproject the jobless rate will be around 7 percent.  Bernanke\u2019s View  In July testimony before Congress, Bernanke said long-term\nunemployment and under-employment, including people working\nfewer hours and at jobs below skill levels, are among the\n\u201cproblems\u201d the labor market continues to face.  The jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to 7.4 percent last\nmonth, in part because of the increase in part-time help.\nAdditional declines in unemployment for the same reason would be\nless meaningful in determining policy makers\u2019 next steps. The\nLabor Department\u2019s August jobs report will be released on Sept.\n6, less than two weeks before the Fed\u2019s next meeting.  A pickup in growth will probably be the main reason\nunemployment will keep dropping, making it easier to read the\njob-market tea leaves, said  Carl Riccadonna , senior U.S.\neconomist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York.  \u201cA faster pace of economic growth is going to mean more\ndemand for labor, and businesses will not have the luxury of\njust adding temporary workers on a part-time basis,\u201d Riccadonna\nsaid. \u201cThis recovery has been much slower and more drawn out\nthan the typical recovery, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s taking time to\nturn that corner. This is the final stage before full-time\nhiring shifts into a higher gear.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nVictoria Stilwell in Washington at \n vstilwell1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChristopher Wellisz at \n cwellisz@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Starbucks Corporation was 31.01944923400879 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Starbucks Corporation was ",
