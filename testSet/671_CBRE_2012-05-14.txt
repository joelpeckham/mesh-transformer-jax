The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCushman & Wakefield  Inc., the largest\nclosely-held commercial real-estate broker, plans to acquire\nrival businesses in  Australia  as it seeks to boost revenue from\nthe nation fivefold by 2016.  The group expects to finalize the purchase of a property\nvaluation company on Australia\u2019s east coast by June 30, said\nDavid Woolford, Australian managing director at the company,\ndeclining to provide further details. Cushman plans to boost\nrevenue from  Australia  to at least A$50 million ($50.1 million)\na year, from about A$10 million now, and to raise its staff to\n300 people from 55 people now, he said in an e-mailed response\nto questions on May 11.  \u201cWe must make substantial acquisitions to take that leap,\nto be competitive,\u201d Woolford said in a telephone interview from\nSydney. \u201cWithout having a strong business in Australia, we\ncan\u2019t capture the global clients.\u201d  The company is pushing into  Asia  with plans to increase the\nregion\u2019s proportion of revenue to 20 percent of total sales in\nfive years from the current 10 percent, Chief Executive Officer\nGlenn Rufrano said in December. The world\u2019s third-biggest real\nestate services group behind  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  and  Jones Lang\nLaSalle Inc. (JLL)  has kept its Australian growth on hold since it\nbegan operating as a full-service real estate broker in 2008,\nand has only recently moved into expansion mode, Woolford said.  Cushman, whose services in Australia include real estate\nvaluation, sales, management, leasing and tenant representation,\nis expanding in Australia as a shortage of properties and demand\nfrom overseas investors and pension funds is expected to boost\nvalues of office towers, prime shopping centers and warehouses.\nOffice values will rise 3.5 percent this year, retail 2.7\npercent and industrial properties 4.4 percent, Jones Lang\nLaSalle said in a report in March.  Hiring Plans  Cushman this month said it had hired John Barras, real\nestate valuer at BarrasValuations Pty and a former director at\nCBRE, to head its valuation and advisory division in Sydney. It\nwill seek to acquire teams of real-estate professionals and\nplans more takeovers of valuation rivals to compete with listed\ncompetitors CBRE and  Jones Lang , Woolford said.  The company, whose Australian business now accounts for\nabout a 10th of its Asia-Pacific operations, will expand from\noffices in Sydney and Brisbane now to Melbourne, Perth and\nAdelaide, he said. Cushman & Wakefield, controlled by Italy\u2019s\nAgnelli family that also controls Fiat SpA, reported net income\nof $19 million for 2011, on revenues of $236.3 million,\naccording to a  statement  on its website.
