 "context": "The following article called 'Bank of Japan Stimulus Row Fueled by Kono\u2019s Nomination: Economy' was published on 2012-03-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapan \u2019s government nominated BNP\nParibas SA economist  Ryutaro Kono  to join the central bank\u2019s\npolicy board, drawing criticism from lawmakers concerned that he\nwon\u2019t support bolder action to end decade-long deflation.  Kono, 47, BNP\u2019s chief Japan economist, was tapped for the\nnine-member board after a committee meeting of lawmakers from\nboth chambers of parliament, a statement showed today.  The nomination comes as the BOJ faces increasing pressure\nto spur a rebound in an economy that shrank for three of the\npast four years and is struggling to recover from last year\u2019s\nearthquake. Lawmakers within the ruling  Democratic Party  of\nJapan and also in opposition parties are calling for Governor\nMasaaki Shirakawa\u2019s board to double an inflation goal of 1\npercent set only last month and expand asset purchases.  \u201cWe\u2019ve seen him as someone who is negative towards\nmonetary easing,\u201d said Takeshi Miyazaki, a DPJ lawmaker and a\nleader of the ruling party\u2019s anti-deflation group, said in  Tokyo \ntoday. \u201cWe\u2019re worried that the market may be concerned that\nthis will push the yen higher and worsen deflation.\u201d  Kono cautioned about \u201caggressive monetary policy\u201d in a\nBloomberg News survey this month. In a sign of increased\nscrutiny of the central bank, Shirakawa has been called to the\nDiet 14 times this year as of 23 March. At that pace, his\nappearances in 2012 will be more than double the number in 2011.  U.S. Outlook  Elsewhere in Asia today, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nPresident  James Bullard  told a conference in  Hong Kong  that U.S.\nmonetary policy may be at a turning point and the Fed\u2019s first\ninterest-rate increase since the global financial crisis could\ncome as soon as late 2013.  Data in the U.S. will give the latest reading on the\nnation\u2019s property market, with new home sales likely to have\nclimbed in February to the highest level in more than a year.\nItaly will report retail sales, while Canada issues inflation\ndata.  Stocks fell in  Asia  today on concern that weakness in\n China \u2019s recovery will cap growth across the region and in the\nworld. A leading index for the nation released by The Conference\nBoard rose at a slower pace in February.  \u201cWhile the economy continues to expand, it is unlikely to\nstrengthen any further in the coming months,\u201d Andrew Polk,\nresident China economist at the New York-based organization,said\nin a statement.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks slid 0.7 percent as\nof 2:02 p.m. in Tokyo.  Japan\u2019s Woes  In Japan, Kono said this month that BOJ policy alone cannot\nsolve structural problems including an aging population and a\ngrowing public debt burden. He also warned that financing\ngovernment debt through a prolonged zero-rate policy and bond-\nbuying by the central bank could hamper growth.  His comments echo the views of Shirakawa, who has warned\nthat monetary policy cannot solve all of Japan\u2019s woes and that\nfinancing public debt would damage the economy over time.  \u201cThe side effects of prolonged and fixed policies can\u2019t be\nignored,\u201d Kono said. \u201cBecause of the ballooning public debt,\nresponding with an aggressive monetary policy could bring the\nrisk that public debt could start the process of spreading due\nto increased nominal interest rates.\u201d  Kono has been at BNP Paribas since 2000. He graduated from\nYokohama National University with a degree in economics in 1987.\nHis published works include translations of books by  Paul\nKrugman  and Princeton University Professor  Alan Blinder , the\nlatter which was co-translated with  Eiji Maeda , currently the\nBOJ\u2019s top economist.  \u2018Great Knowledge\u2019  Kono \u201chas good communication skills and is a prominent\neconomist in Japan,\u201d said  Takuji Okubo , chief Japan economist\nat Societe Generale SA in Tokyo, referring to Kono. \u201cIn that\nsense, this nomination is desirable for the BOJ. It\u2019s a choice\nthat would be difficult for the opposition parties to oppose.\u201d  In contrast with the lawmakers\u2019 concerns, Okubo described\nKono as \u201cdovish.\u201d He added that he wasn\u2019t a person who says\n\u201cradical things.\u201d  The appointment needs the approval of both houses of the\nDiet. If approved, he will join the board as soon as the April\n9-10 meeting. Kono was nominated to replace  Seiji Nakamura , 69,\na shipping company executive, in a break with a tradition of\nreplacing members with people from similar backgrounds.  \u201cHe\u2019s someone who is negative about quantitative easing\nand the inflation target policy,\u201d said  Kozo Yamamoto , an\nopposition  Liberal Democratic Party  lawmaker who said his party\nshould reject the nomination. \u201cHis nomination should be refused\nby the upper house. What the BOJ policy board needs is a someone\nwho supports reflation.\u201d  One Nomination  The steering committee charged with handling the\nappointments only made one nomination today after another\ncandidate\u2019s name was leaked to the media, Yosuke Tsuruho, an\nopposition Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker who sits on the\ngroup, told reporters in Tokyo today. The Nikkei newspaper\nreported Kohei Watanabe, an adviser to trading house  Itochu\nCorp. (8001) , would be nominated. Watanabe\u2019s candidacy will not be\nconsidered, Tsuruho said.  The  Bank of Japan  expanded asset purchases in February,\nwhile board member Ryuzo Miyao\u2019s proposal for more stimulus was\nrejected in March. The appointment of new board members is part\nof the lead-up to a bigger shift: Shirakawa\u2019s term is ending in\nApril 2013 and two deputy governors are finish their tenures in\nMarch next year.  Past Disputes  BOJ nominations haven\u2019t always been successful. Shirakawa\nwas originally appointed as a temporary governor in 2008 as the\nopposition controlled upper house had rejected the government\nchoices for the BOJ top positions. He was subsequently\nconfirmed. In 2008 and 2009, the opposition-controlled upper\nhouse rejected five nominees for governor, deputy governor and\nboard member. Since then, four new policy board members have\nbeen approved without political opposition.  \u201cHe has great knowledge of financial markets, and is bound\nto add a lot to rate decision meetings.\u201d said Naoki Iizuka, a\nsenior economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo and an\nacquaintance of Kono. \u201cHe\u2019ll be neutral. He won\u2019t take the lead\non monetary easing, but he won\u2019t oppose any proposals to expand\nstimulus.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nKeiko Ujikane in Tokyo at \n kujikane@bloomberg.net ;\nMasahiro Hidaka in Tokyo at \n mhidaka@bloomberg.net ;\nTakashi Hirokawa in Tokyo at \n thirokawa@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nPaul Panckhurst at \n ppanckhurst@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 34.12742233276367 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
