 "context": "The following article called 'Los Angeles Digital Billboards Go Dark in Blight Battle' was published on 2013-07-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA battle by Los Angeles homeowners\nover visual \u201cblight\u201d that shut off digital billboards across\nthe city is shifting as  Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc. (CCO) \nseeks to restore signs that are central to its business model.  Almost 100 darkened billboards loom over boulevards and\nstreets, switched off in mid-April after a judge rejected a deal\nbetween the second-largest U.S. city and sign-operators Clear\nChannel and CBS Outdoor Inc. The agreement attempted to sidestep\na moratorium on digital installations except in special areas.  Los Angeles, which dealt with $1.6 billion in combined\ndeficits over the past four years, collects no franchise fees on\nbillboards, according to Luke Zamperini, who administers their\nregulation for the Building and Safety Department. Clear Channel\nis negotiating with City Council members on a \u201clegislative\nsolution\u201d involving a permitting fee, said Greg McGrath,\npresident of its Southern California division.  \u201cLos Angeles is home to the entertainment industry,\u201d\nMcGrath said. \u201cIt\u2019s home to the outdoor industry. We\u2019ve been in\nLos Angeles for over a century. Here we are in the home of the\nentertainment industry, the digital industry, and we\u2019re unable\nto use them in our own hometown.\u201d  Los Angeles, with more roadway miles along which to display\nbillboards than New York or  Chicago , is defined partly by its\nsigns. The letters spelling out Hollywood, erected in 1923 to\npromote a housing development, are world famous. Singer and\nactress Angelyne drew attention for buying cleavage-baring\nbillboards promoting herself. She finished 28th among 125\ncandidates running for governor in a 2003 recall election that\ncatapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger to the state\u2019s highest office.  Billboard Plan  Clear Channel Outdoor, a unit of San Antonio-based radio-station owner Clear Channel Communications Inc., operates about\n1,500 billboards in Los Angeles. McGrath said Clear Channel is\nwilling to contribute permitting fees as part of a\n\u201ccomprehensive legislative solution\u201d that would reduce its\ntotal number of billboards and move certain signs. He declined\nto say how much the company might offer. A spokeswoman for CBS\nOutdoor, Shannon Jacobs, declined to comment.  Mayor Eric Garcetti, who took office July 1, \u201csupported\nthe recent court decision against digital billboards in L.A. and\nis keeping an eye on subsequent developments,\u201d said Yusef Robb,\na spokesman. \u201cHis priority is to work with neighbors to keep\nunwanted billboards out of communities.\u201d  The billboard industry may be encouraged because it backed\nthree new city council members elected this year, according to\ncity filings. There are 15 seats on the panel.  Residents\u2019 Objections  \u201cIt is a concern of ours that some of those new council\nmembers may drink the Kool-Aid that these companies are\noffering,\u201d said Dennis Hathaway, of the Los Angeles\nneighborhood of  Venice , who founded the Coalition to Ban\nBillboard Blight.  Residents object to digital billboards because of the light\nfrom them that streams into homes and apartments, distractions\nto drivers and the environmental cost of powering the displays\naround the clock, Hathaway said.  Clear Channel, the largest outdoor advertising company in\nNorth America by revenue, typically gets its highest rates for\ndigital billboards, which can be changed as often as several\ntimes a minute, according to a May 17 securities filing. William Eccleshare, chief executive officer of the advertising company,\nhas predicted that half of its business in 10 years will be\ndigital.  $100 Million  The signs may generate $100 million a year for CBS and\nClear Channel, based on their rate cards, said Timothy Alger, an\nattorney for a rival company, Santa Monica-based Summit Media\nLLC. Clear Channel and CBS Outdoor were forced to shut off the\nsigns after a judge sided with Summit, which contended that a\n2006 deal giving the companies a duopoly on digital signs was\nillegal.  Jacobs, the CBS Outdoors spokeswoman, declined to comment\non the Summit figure. The company\u2019s parent,  CBS Corp. (CBS) , is\nsplitting off its outdoor business, filing an initial public\noffering for $100 million, according to Bloomberg Industries.\nCBS\u2019s outdoor segment generated $1.3 billion in 2012, 9 percent\nof the parent company\u2019s revenue.  Clear Channel \u201cdoes not report financial information with\nthis level of granularity and cannot comment,\u201d said Jennifer\nWonnacott, an outside spokesman for Clear Channel at Fiona\nHutton & Associates.  The company\u2019s 1,000 digital displays boosted its Americas\noutdoor operating revenue 2 percent, to $286.5 million, in the\nthree months ended March 31, according to the filing. Clear\nChannel\u2019s first-quarter expenses rose $2 million primarily\nbecause of legal costs related to the Los Angeles dispute,\naccording to its filing.  Turned Off  Clear Channel turned off 82 digital billboards in Los\nAngeles and CBS deactivated 13 in April after Los Angeles\nSuperior Court Judge Terry Green ruled that permits issued to\nthe companies under the 2006 agreement were invalid, according\nto a prospectus filed by Clear Channel in June.  Summit, which brought the case in 2008, has petitioned\nGreen to order the billboard structures torn down, Alger said.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like Times Square where you have big, colorful\ndisplays,\u201d Alger said in an interview. \u201cThese billboards are\nbasically sprinkled throughout Los Angeles.\u201d  In 2002, the City Council passed a moratorium on new\nbillboards, which was challenged in court by Clear Channel and\nCBS. The city settled the case in 2006 by keeping the cap in\nplace while allowing the companies to convert as many as 840\nstandard billboards to digital. About 100 of the signs had been\nswitched by the time Summit won its case.  \u2018Seriously Undermines\u2019  Lamar Advertising Co. (LAMR) \u2019s Lamar Central Outdoor LLC, which\nhas permits for 3,000 non-digital billboards in Los Angeles,\npetitioned the Los Angeles Superior Court in March to allow it\nto convert 17 billboards to digital. Lamar said that exempting\nClear Channel and CBS from the ban on digital billboards\n\u201cseriously undermines\u201d Los Angeles\u2019s rationale for the ban.  Like many cities, Los Angeles collects franchise fees from\ncertain businesses for the right to operate within municipal\nboundaries. Los Angeles  estimates  it will collect $42.6 million\nin such revenue for 2013-14 from natural gas, cable television\nand taxi companies, among others.  The city charges $186 per billboard every three years to\noffset the costs of permitting and inspecting the structures,\nZamperini said. It makes no money from the billboards, he said.  CBS Outdoors backed three of the  eight  Los Angeles City\nCouncil members elected this year. It erected billboards worth\n$9,000 for Joe Buscaino, $4,500 for Curren Price Jr. and $8,518\nfor Gilbert Cedillo, according to city Ethics Commission\ndocuments.  Council Members  \u201cI am generally supportive of digital billboards,\ndepending on the impact on a particular community and the\nwillingness of the\u00a0billboard company using the space to provide\nbenefits back to the community,\u00a0like advertising and community\nservices,\u201d Price said in a written statement in response to\nquestions from Bloomberg News.  A spokesman for Cedillo, Fredy Ceja, said the councilman\nstill is studying the issue and wouldn\u2019t comment. A Buscaino\nspokesman, Dennis Gleason, didn\u2019t respond to e-mail and\nvoicemail messages.  About 4,000 of the approximately 400,000 billboards in the\nU.S. are digital, according of the Washington-based Outdoor\nAdvertising Association of America.  Advertisers are drawn to the \u201cspeed and flexibility\u201d of\nthe changing digital signs, a particular attribute for drivers\nin traffic-choked cities, Ken Klein, executive vice president of\nthe industry group, said in a statement.  \u201cThe overall trend line for digital billboards is\nregulatory acceptance,\u201d Klein said. \u201cKeeping pace with\ntechnology, most states have taken steps to regulate digital\nbillboards.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJames Nash in Los Angeles at \n jnash24@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nStephen Merelman at \n smerelman@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. was 3.571107864379883 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. was ",
