(AAPL)  and  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) \u2019s\nproposals for smaller SIM cards face a second round of debate\nafter talks stalled following the Finnish mobile-phone company\u2019s\nthreat to withhold its patents.  A two-day meeting in Sophia Antipolis,  France , to adopt a\nstandard from competing proposals by Apple and Nokia finished\ntoday without reaching a decision, the  European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute  said in an e-mailed\nstatement.  The tiny smartcards that identify wireless subscribers are\nstandardized to reduce industry costs and give consumers freedom\nto switch handsets and networks. Smaller versions permit the\ndesign of thinner phones. Nokia said before the meeting that it\nwould not permit its patents to be used in the Apple standard,\nsaid Mark Durrant, a spokesman for the Espoo-based company.  \u201cGenerally in ETSI all of our decisions are taken by\nconsensus and it\u2019s very uncommon that we have a technical\nvote,\u201d said Ultan Mulligan, an ETSI spokesman. \u201cIf they have\ndecided to postpone the vote, that would give them more time to\nachieve consensus.\u201d  ETSI began to develop a  standard  last year for  identity\ncards  at least 25 percent to 40 percent smaller than the mini-\nSIM standard, according to its website.  The decision could be made at a meeting starting May 31 in\nOsaka or at a new meeting with 30 days\u2019 notice, ETSI said in the\nstatement.  \u201cWe hope that this extra time will allow ETSI members to\nwork collaboratively on selecting the best technology solution\nthat meets ETSI\u2019s pre-agreed requirements, rather than adopting\nan inferior solution,\u201d Durrant said by e-mail. The Nokia\nproposal incorporates work by BlackBerry handset maker  Research\nin Motion Ltd. (RIM) , he said.  Apple declined to comment, Tanya Ridd, a spokeswoman, said\nby e-mail today.  Nokia closed up  2.1 percent  at 4.08 euros in Helsinki.\nApple declined  1.5 percent  to $600.52 at 3:11 p.m. in  New York .
