 "context": "The following article called 'Jobs Threatened Suit If Palm Didn\u2019t Agree to Hiring Terms' was published on 2013-01-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc. (AAPL)  founder  Steve Jobs \nsuggested the computer maker collude with Palm Inc. to prevent\nthe companies from hiring employees away from each other,\naccording to a court filing in an antitrust lawsuit.  In 2007 Jobs called Edward T. Colligan, who was then Palm\u2019s\nchief executive officer, to propose the arrangement and during\nthat call suggested that if Palm didn\u2019t agree, Apple might file\npatent-infringement claims against it, according to the filing\nyesterday in federal court in San Jose, California.  The declaration by Colligan was filed in a lawsuit claiming\nthe iPhone maker and other technology companies violated\nantitrust laws by entering into agreements to not recruit each\nother\u2019s employees. The other defendants in the case include\n Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Intel Corp. (INTC) ,  Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) ,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) \u2019s\nPixar animation unit,  Intuit Inc. (INTU)  and Lucasfilm Ltd.  Colligan rejected Jobs\u2019s proposal in an Aug. 24, 2007 e-\nmail saying his idea is \u201cnot only wrong, it is likely\nillegal,\u201d and the threat of patent litigation is \u201cjust out of\nline,\u201d according to the filing.  Jobs, who died in October 2011, responded by saying\nColligan\u2019s response wasn\u2019t \u201csatisfactory\u201d to Apple because\nPalm was actively recruiting Apple employees.  Asymmetrical Resources  \u201cI\u2019m sure you realize the asymmetry in the financial\nresources of our respective companies when you say: \u2018We will\nboth just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money.\u2019\u201d Jobs\nwrote in an e-mail, a copy of which was attached to yesterday\u2019s\nfiling. \u201cMy advice is to take a look at our patent portfolio\nbefore you make a final decision here.\u201d  Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-\nbased Apple, didn\u2019t immediately respond to an e-mail yesterday\nafter regular business hours seeking comment on the filing.  Last week,  Tim Cook , Apple Inc.\u2019s chief executive officer,\nwas ordered to give a deposition in the private lawsuit brought\non behalf of employees. The case mirrors claims the companies\nsettled with the U.S. Justice Department in 2010 following a\nprobe, arguing the companies agreed to refrain from placing\n\u201ccold calls\u201d to lure workers from competitors.  Robert Mittelstaedt , a lawyer representing the companies,\nargued at a hearing last week that the employees\u2019 lawyers\nhaven\u2019t demonstrated that everyone in the proposed class was\nhurt by any such agreements, as is required for the group to be\ncertified as a class.  Engineers, Sous Chefs  The proposed class of employees includes engineers, sous\nchefs, administrative assistants and others, because all of the\nemployees were harmed by the companies\u2019 conduct and will rely on\nthe same evidence to prove their damages, lawyers for the\nworkers said in a court filing.  In the 2010 settlement, the Justice Department said the\ncompanies kept do-not-call lists to avoid competitive\nrecruiting, and that such agreements restrained competition,\nwhich hurt employees.  Palm was acquired by  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  in 2010. Michael Thacker, a spokesman for for the company, didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to an e-mail yesterday after regular business hours\nseeking comment on the filing.
