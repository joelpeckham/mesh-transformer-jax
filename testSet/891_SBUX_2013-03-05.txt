 "context": "The following article called 'Cooparaiso Sees Brazil Reaping Record Off-Year Coffee Harvest' was published on 2013-03-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCoffee growers in Brazil, the\nworld\u2019s largest producer, will harvest a record crop for a\nseason in which trees enter the lower-yielding half of the two-\nyear cycle, according to growers cooperative Cooparaiso.  Production will be 47 million to 48 million bags in the\n2013-14 season, Francisco Ourique, a manager at the cooperative\nin Sao Sebastiao do Paraiso in the state of Minas Gerais, said\nin an interview in  London  yesterday. That is down from 51\nmillion bags a year earlier. The season in Brazil usually starts\nin July, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . A bag\nof coffee weighs 132 pounds (60 kilograms).  The output fluctuations between the high and low-yielding\nhalf of the cycle have been decreasing because of new pruning\ntechniques and better husbandry as well as growers increasing\nthe amount of trees per hecatere, Ourique said. While the\nhistorical record decline for an off-year is about 30 percent,\nthe drops in production now are about 10 percent, he said.\nOutput this season may fall as much as 7.8 percent, according to\nCooparaiso. In the last off-year, it fell 10 percent, data from\nConab,  Brazil \u2019s government crop-forecasting agency, showed.  \u201cPeople are attributing the reduction in the biennial\ncycle from a historical record of about 30 percent to around 10\npercent to what we call harvest zero,\u201d Ourique said. Harvest\nzero is a pruning technique that allows producers to maintain\nconstant average production. That together with planting more\ntrees per hectare allows for smaller fluctuations from one year\nto the next.  Dense Plantings  Coffee growers in Brazil have on average 2,700 trees per\nhectare (2.47 acres) now, up from an average 1,750 trees per\nhectare in the 1980s and 1990s, according to Ourique. That may\nclimb to 3,500 trees a hectare, he said. Cooparaiso has almost\n6,000 members and produces on average 3.74 million bags of\ncoffee a year, according to its  website .  Minas Gerais , where it\nis based, is Brazil\u2019s largest arabica coffee-producing state.  The reduced fluctuation in Brazil\u2019s production during the\non and off-year cycles due to a combination of new pruning\ntechniques and more dense plantings is \u201cconfusing players,\u201d\nOurique said.  \u201cIf I have 4,000 trees competing for the same soil and the\nprice doesn\u2019t pay for farmers to apply fertilizers three times a\nyear, the reaction to less adequate husbandry in the longer term\nwill bring some surprises,\u201d he said.  \u201cThat\u2019s because that same soil that had 2,000 plants per\nhectare had a whole base of natural nutrients and applied\ninputs. Now if I have 4,000-5,000 plants per hectare, if I don\u2019t\nfeed them, they will starve. Today we know that for the next\nharvest, few people applied inputs three times, most did it\ntwice.\u201d More pronounced fluctuations may still occur, he said.  Leaf Rust  Arabica coffee fell 37 percent in  New York  last year,\npartly on speculation that Brazil would have a record crop and\ndue to rising stockpiles. Inventories in warehouses monitored by\nICE Futures U.S. stood at 2.69 million bags yesterday, the\nhighest since March 2010, exchange data on Bloomberg showed. The\nbeans favored by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  were the worst performer in the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials in 2012.  Demand for Brazilian coffee will probably rise as roasters\nlook to fill in the gap left by supplies from Central American\nnations, which are battling leaf rust, a disease that affects\nfoliage, he said. Production from  Mexico  to  Peru  may drop by 2\nmillion to 4 million bags the 2012-13 season that started Oct. 1\nand more damage may occur in 2013-14, Ourique said.  \u201cThere is no way out,\u201d he said. Roasters need 55 million\nto 60 million bags of arabica a year, he said. \u201cWhere are they\ngoing to get it from? This is an issue that evidently the market\nhas to start worrying more about.\u201d  Leaf rust is a disease hard to treat because fungicides\nhave to be applied and re-applied every time it rains, said\nCooparaiso\u2019s Ourique. Falling prices make it harder for\nproducers in Central America to fight the disease, according to\nresearcher F.O. Licht GmbH in  Germany .
