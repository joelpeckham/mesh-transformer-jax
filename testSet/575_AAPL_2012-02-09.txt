(GOOG)  plans its first stand-\nalone retail store at its European headquarters in Dublin after\na trial at a computer shop in London, according to a filing by\nthe world\u2019s most popular search engine.  The Google Store would be open to the public and sell\nunspecified Google merchandise, the company\u2019s Irish unit said in\na local planning application. Located in the Montevetro office\nblock on Dublin\u2019s Barrow Street, the store would have about 123\nsquare meters (1,323 square feet) of space including an added\nmezzanine floor designed to draw attention from passersby.  Retail may be a new front in Google\u2019s competition with\n Apple Inc. (AAPL) , whose 361 stores have fueled sales of iPods, iPhones\nand iPad tablet computers. Google, the world\u2019s biggest maker of\nsmartphone operating software, is in the process of buying\nhandset maker Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. for $12.5 billion\nto help it compete with Apple\u2019s phones and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s\nmobile software.  \u201cWe\u2019ve not made any decisions, it\u2019s simply a planning\napplication,\u201d the  Mountain View , California-based company said\ntoday by e-mail. Google already has an online store selling\nmerchandise such as t-shirts and pens, it said.  Google opened a store inside a London branch of Currys and\nPC World, units of Dixons Retail Plc, as a trial for selling\n laptop computers  running the company\u2019s Chromebook operating\nsystem, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported in October.  Google Logo  Google has a store selling products with a Google logo at\nits headquarters in  California , which isn\u2019t open to the public.\nThe company also offers merchandise at  www.googlestore.com ,\nfeaturing merchandise such as baby bibs and notebooks with the\nlogo.  The planning application, prepared by consultants John\nSpain Associates for Google Ireland Inc., was approved by Dublin\nCity Council on Jan. 23. The document also describes a staff\nswimming pool in an area designed for use as a restaurant.  Google plans to add a 53-square-meter mezzanine floor to\nthe store space for use by \u201cbusiness partners and\ncontributors\u201d who visit and don\u2019t need full access to the\nbuilding, according to the document. \u201cThe unit will be clearly\nvisible from the public street and will create additional\ninterest and animation,\u201d Google said in the filing.  The Dublin office is Google\u2019s largest location outside of\nthe U.S., according to the filing. Google bought the two\nbuildings that make up its existing headquarters in March for an\nundisclosed price. It also leases space at two other properties\nin the area. It purchased the Montevetro site in April for about\n100 million euros ($133 million) from Real Estate Opportunities\nPlc.  Dublin Expansion  Google will have more than 3,000 employees in the Dublin\narea after it expands into the building and refurbishes its\nexisting headquarters across the street, according to the\ndocument.  The European Commission, the EU\u2019s antitrust arm, will rule\non the Motorola Mobility deal by Feb. 13 and can either clear it\nor open an in-depth probe. Mobile phone subscriptions in Ireland\nincreased to 5.4 million through June, up from 5.27 million in\nthe previous quarter, according to the government\u2019s Commission\nfor Communications Regulation. The population was 4.58 million\nlast year, according to census figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nNeil Callanan in  London  at \n ncallanan@bloomberg.net .
