 "context": "The following article called 'German Fourth-Quarter Slump Caused by Exports, Investment' was published on 2013-02-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGermany \u2019s economic contraction in\nthe fourth quarter was driven by a drop in exports and\ninvestment as the sovereign debt crisis damped euro-area demand,\na breakdown of the data shows.  Exports fell 2 percent from the third quarter and company\ninvestment in plant and machinery declined 0.7 percent, the\nFederal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Gross\ndomestic product dropped 0.6 percent, the office said,\nconfirming an initial estimate on Feb. 14. From a year earlier,\nthe economy grew 0.4 percent when adjusted for working days.  Europe \u2019s largest economy should avoid recession and return\nto growth this quarter as industrial production picks up, the\nBundesbank said on Feb. 18. While unemployment at a two-decade\nlow and exports to  emerging markets  are helping Germany to\nweather the euro-area recession, uncertainty over Europe\u2019s path\nout of the debt crisis could still weigh on the recovery.  \u201cWe should return to growth in the first quarter and\ninvestment should resume its upward trend in the course of this\nyear,\u201d said Lothar Hessler, an economist at HSBC Trinkaus &\nBurkhardt AG in Dusseldorf, who expects the economy to expand\n0.6 percent in 2013. \u201cThe risks to this outlook are a possible\nre-eruption of the European crisis after elections in  Italy , or\ncontinued uncertainty about the U.S. fiscal cliff.\u201d  Household spending rose 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter\nand public spending increased 0.4 percent, today\u2019s report\nshowed. Domestic demand added 0.2 percentage point to GDP, while\nnet trade subtracted 0.8 percentage point.  Euro-Area Recession  The recession in the 17-nation euro area deepened in the\nfourth quarter, with GDP falling by a more-than-forecast 0.6\npercent, damping demand for German goods in the country\u2019s\nlargest export market.  While measures of economic confidence in Europe have risen,\nEuropean Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  has said he expects\nfurther weakness in the region\u2019s economy in the first half of\nthe year followed by a \u201cvery gradual\u201d recovery.  The ECB forecasts a 0.3 percent contraction for the euro\narea this year, while the Bundesbank predicts 0.4 percent growth\nin Germany.  German business confidence probably rose to an eight-month\nhigh this month, adding to signs of gathering economic momentum.\nThat report is due from the Ifo institute in Munich at 10 a.m.\ntoday.  Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, Germany\u2019s biggest cable\ntelevision operator, said on Feb. 20 it would boost investment\nin its network by 300 million euros ($396 million) over two\nyears as sales beat expectations.  \u201cThe German economy is beginning to move again,\u201d said\nGerd Hassel, an economist at BHF Bank AG in  Frankfurt . \u201cExports\nshould grow this year, although perhaps not by much. But a\nbacklog in investment caused by the debt crisis could begin to\nbe cleared.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJeff Black in Frankfurt at \n jblack25@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nCraig Stirling at \n cstirling1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 34.39762878417969 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
