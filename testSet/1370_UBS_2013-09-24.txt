 "context": "The following article called 'Potash Shake-Up Takes Toll as Agrium Sees Drop in Sales' was published on 2013-09-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAgrium Inc. (AGU)  is the latest North\nAmerican potash producer to cut its sales forecast as the\nbreakup of the world\u2019s largest marketing bloc for the crop\nnutrient begins to take its toll.  Agrium, the third-largest North American producer, expects\nto sell 30 percent less potash in the third quarter and forecast\na 64 percent drop in profit from its wholesale fertilizer\ndivision, the Calgary-based company said yesterday. U.S.-based\nMosaic Co., the second-biggest producer, cut its sales forecast\nby about 20 percent on Sept. 16.  The two companies form an export group, Canpotex Ltd., with\n Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. ,  North America \u2019s biggest\nproducer. Potash Corp. won\u2019t be spared the drop in demand, said\nPeter Prattas, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in Toronto.  \u201cThey\u2019re all going to hurt equally given the fact that\nthey\u2019re a collected group,\u201d Prattas said yesterday in a\ntelephone interview.  The potash market has been roiled since OAO Uralkali, the\n world\u2019s largest  producer, announced it had pulled out of an\nexport sales venture with its Belarusian counterpart on July 30.\nThe Berezniki, Russia-based company said it would boost output\nand start selling at lower prices, a move that sent shares of\nfertilizer companies such as Potash Corp. and Tel Aviv-based\n Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)   falling . Potash Corp. has declined 15\npercent since the day before the Uralkali announcement while ICL\nhas declined 16 percent.  \u2018Essentially Paralyzed\u2019  Potash Corp. Chief Financial Officer Wayne Brownlee said\nduring a Sept. 18 investor conference in  New York  that volumes\nin offshore markets \u201chave been essentially paralyzed.\u201d He is\nscheduled to give an  update  on the company\u2019s activities today at\na conference in Toronto.  Buyers are holding back, in anticipation that prices will\nsink, before stocking up on the crop nutrient, said  John Hughes ,\nan analyst at Desjardins Securities Inc. in Toronto.  \u201cWhy buy today at 400 bucks U.S. a ton potash if the\ngeneral perspective is we\u2019re going to head to $300 or $350?\u201d\nHughes said yesterday by phone.  The change is affecting Uralkali as well, Danila Yakub, a\nMoscow-based analyst for UBS AG, said in a Sept. 20 report.\nRussian customs data suggests September exports may be down 40\npercent from the average of the prior 12 months, Yakub said.  Agrium, which also produces nitrogen and phosphate\nfertilizers and is the largest U.S. farm-products retailer,\nforecast third-quarter wholesale fertilizer sales that were\nworse than estimated, Hughes said.  Lower Prices  \u201cMost were looking for maybe a 15 or 20 percent decline in\nsales volume, and we\u2019re getting a 25 to 30,\u201d he said.  Potash, which helps strengthen plant roots and improve\nresistance to drought, isn\u2019t traded on public exchanges. Prices\nfor delivery at  Vancouver \u2019s port have fallen to $410 a metric\nton, 19 percent less than a year earlier, according to data from\nGreen Markets, a fertilizer-industry information provider that\nis a unit of Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News .  The average retail potash price in 11 U.S. states has\ndeclined 11 percent to $538.93 a ton since the Uralkali breakup,\naccording to  data  from Green Markets.  Prattas said global prices may decline further.  \u201cIn order for volumes to recover, the price does have to\ncome down lower,\u201d he said.  The first big step to reforming the Russia-Belarus export\ngroup is to return Uralkali Chief Executive Officer Vladislav Baumgertner to  Russia , Hughes said.  Baumgertner was arrested in Minsk on Aug. 26 on charges of\nabuse of office as chairman of the joint venture. A meeting\nbetween Russian President  Vladimir Putin  and his Belarusian\ncounterpart Aleksandr Lukashenko signals Baumgertner may be\nreleased soon, Hughes said.  The marketing group, formerly known as Belarusian Potash\nCo., may be back together by the end of the year, he said.  Even so, a reunification of potash producers in the former\n Soviet Union  doesn\u2019t mean prices will increase, Prattas said.\nThe two companies may agree to keep volumes high and prices low,\nhe said.  \u201cThat\u2019s yet to be determined,\u201d Hughes said.
