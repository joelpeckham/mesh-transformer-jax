The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRepsol YPF SA \u2019s planned sale of\nshares in its Brazilian unit is a \u201cpositive trigger\u201d for the\nvaluation of Spain\u2019s biggest oil company, JPMorgan said.  \u201cIt will help to realize a fuller valuation for its pre-\nsalt discoveries,\u201d London-based analysts  Fred Lucas  and  Nitin Sharma  wrote today in a note. \u201cConcerns on potential demand\nweakness in the local market are overdone. We believe that the\ncompany\u2019s good exploration track record, pure upstream bias and\nwell appraised resource base ought to be an attractive\npreposition for investors.\u201d  Repsol , which plans to sell about 40 percent of its\nBrazilian business through an initial public offering, filed to\nsell voting shares in the unit on Aug. 9. The Madrid-based\ncompany is seeking to raise about $4 billion from the stock\nsale, valuing the unit at about $10 billion, two people familiar\nwith the plan said in July.  The JPMorgan analysts have an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on\n Repsol  and increased the share-price estimate to 23 euros from\n21 euros. The shares have advanced 0.4 percent in Madrid so far\nthis year, giving Repsol a market value of 23 billion euros ($31\nbillion).  Repsol has stakes in blocks in Brazil\u2019s Santos, Campos and\nEspirito Santo basins, and will invest as much as $5 billion\nthere from 2010 through 2014, and as much as $9 billion from\n2015 through 2019.  Since 2007, Repsol and partners  BG Group Plc  and Brazil\u2019s\nstate-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA  have found hydrocarbons\nin the offshore Carioca, Guara and Iguacu fields in the Santos\nBasin\u2019s BM-S-9 block. These are ultra-deep deposits beneath a\nsalt layer under the seabed.  Petrobras, as Brazil\u2019s state-controlled oil company is\nknown, estimated in November 2007 that the Santos Basin\u2019s pre-\nsalt Tupi field may contain as many as 8 billion barrels of oil,\nthe largest find in the Americas since Mexico\u2019s Cantarell field\nin 1976. Repsol doesn\u2019t own a stake in Tupi.
