 "context": "The following article called 'Traders Win as Nations Provoke Swings With Protests: Currencies' was published on 2013-01-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe growing chorus of government\nofficials around the world bemoaning the inflated levels of\ntheir currencies is proving to be a bonanza for traders.  A JPMorgan Chase & Co. index that tracks  volatility \nmeasures by options in the $4 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange\nmarket has risen almost 2 percentage points from a more than\nfive-year low in December, led by developed-nation currencies\nsuch as the dollar, yen and euro. At the same time, the Chicago\nBoard Options Exchange Volatility Index tracking price swings in\n stocks  has fallen.  From  Thailand  to  Russia  and Costa Rica, officials are\nexpressing alarm over the appreciation of their currencies as\nincreased monetary easing in the U.S., Japan and other developed\nnations spurs demand for high-yielding assets found largely in\nemerging markets. Rising volatility creates more opportunity to\nprofit for traders, who saw foreign-exchange revenue slide last\nyear as central-bank policies aimed at spurring growth through\nlow  interest rates  stifled movement between currencies and cut\nvolumes by $300 billion a day.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-way bet for the major currencies\nanymore,\u201d Doug Borthwick, a managing director and head of\nforeign exchange at Chapdelaine FX in  New York , said in a Jan.\n16 telephone interview.  Franc, Pound  The Swiss franc fell against the euro today to the weakest\nsince the central bank imposed a cap on the currency in 2011.\nThe yen has tumbled 17 percent in the past six months, based on\nBloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes. The gauges show the\ndollar has depreciated 3.7 percent in the same period, while the\npound has weakened 1.9 percent.  Central banks see lower currencies as a way to boost\nexports and bolster their economies amid austerity measures,\nhigh unemployment and low business confidence.  The  World Bank  in  Washington  cut its global growth forecast\nfor this year to 2.4 percent, down from a June forecast of 3\npercent. It halved its forecast for Japan, cut the U.S.\nprojection by 0.5 percentage point and predicted a second year\nof contraction in the euro region. It also lowered projections\nfor emerging markets led by  Brazil ,  India  and  Mexico .  The combination of interest rates at or about record lows\nin the U.S.,  Europe  and Japan diminished the allure of the\ndollar, euro and yen, the three most-traded currencies. In\naddition to  Switzerland , nations such as Brazil established\ncontrols on exchange rates, making it less lucrative to trade\nforeign exchange.  \u2018Tremendous News\u2019  \u201cThe Japanese government has come out and said they want\nto weaken their currency while people feel things in Europe are\nbeing rectified,\u201d Chapdelaine FX\u2019s Borthwick said. \u201cFor\ntrading purposes, this is tremendous news.\u201d  Daily trading as measured by CLS Bank, operator of the\nlargest currency-transaction settlement system, fell 6 percent\nto $4.72 trillion in the third quarter from a year earlier.  Foreign-exchange funds overall lost 1.5 percent for the\nyear through November, according to Parker Global Strategies\nLLC, which tracks about 40 programs. Four of the largest U.S.\nactively managed currency funds with positive results in 2012\naveraged a 3.7 percent return in 2012, compared with a 16\npercent gain in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  \u201cVolumes of trading went down the toilet last year,\u201d\n Steven Barrow , head of Group of 10 research at Standard Bank\nPlc, said in a phone interview from  London  yesterday. \u201cSo far\nthis year, things are far more active. It was hard for managers\nto make reasonable returns in major currencies last year.\u201d  Relative Volatility  The Global Currency Program fund at FX Concepts LLC was up\n0.4 percent last year through November, the New York-based\nfirm\u2019s most up-to-date return figures show. That was an\nimprovement from a 19.4 percent loss in 2011, while below its\nannualized return of 6.8 percent since March 2001.  While increasing, volatility is still relatively low. The\nJPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index was at 8.84 percent as of\n8:21 a.m. in New York, up from last year\u2019s low of 7.05 percent\nin December and compared with the average of 10.7 percent since\nthe beginning of 2000. It reached as high as 27 percent during\nthe financial crisis in October 2008.  The company\u2019s  developed  markets gauge jumped to 9.15\npercent from December\u2019s low of 7.06 percent. The  emerging\nmarkets   index  was 7.07, after declining to 6.8 percent on Jan.\n14, it\u2019s lowest since 2007.  \u2018Dramatic Differences\u2019  Investors in some emerging-markets currencies, such as the\nHungarian forint, Indonesian rupiah and Turkish lira, may be\nunderestimating the risk of greater fluctuations as slower\ngrowth may curb foreign capital and weaken exchange rates,\naccording to Stephen Jen, former head of currency strategy at\nMorgan Stanley.  \u201cFor some of these currencies, there\u2019s still a lot of\ndownside,\u201d Jen, the managing partner at hedge fund SLJ Macro\nPartners LLP in London, said in a telephone interview on Jan.\n16. \u201cAs growth slows, people will start to distinguish between\nthe weaker countries and more robust emerging economies. Then\nwe\u2019ll see quite dramatic differences in performance.\u201d  Political leaders in emerging markets have repeatedly\ncomplained about strong currencies as a result of loose monetary\npolicies in the developed world. The world is on the brink of a\nfresh \u201ccurrency war,\u201d a Russian central-bank official said\nthis week as European policy makers joined Japan in bemoaning\nthe economic cost of rising exchange rates.  \u201cJapan is weakening the yen and other countries may\nfollow,\u201d Bank Rossii First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev \nsaid at a conference on Jan. 16 in Moscow.  Russia Intervention  Russia\u2019s central bank has bought 15.1 billion rubles ($499\nmillion) of foreign currency in the two weeks since Jan. 8 to\nstem the ruble\u2019s advance after abstaining from interventions in\nDecember, Bank Rossii data show.  The  Philippines  followed  South Korea  last month in imposing\nrestrictions on trading non-deliverable currency forwards as the\npeso strengthened to the highest level since 2008. The central\nbank intervened in the foreign-exchange market and is focused on\ncontaining inflows from speculators, Governor Amando Tetangco\nsaid in a speech in  Manila  on Jan. 15.  Implied volatility on three-month peso options fell to a\nrecord low of 4.53 percent the same day.  Real, Colon  Brazil\u2019s central bank has used currency derivatives to buy\ndollars when the real appreciated, and sell them when it fell\nand stoked inflation pressure. That has kept the real between 2\nand 2.15 per dollar since July and pushed the volatility measure\nto a record low of 6.95 percent in November.  Costa Rica plans to reduce interest rates to discourage\ncapital inflows after the colon reached the strongest in almost\nfive years. Thailand\u2019s baht retreated from a 17-month high\nyesterday after Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said the\n exchange rate  is \u201cnot at a good level\u201d and exporters will face\ndifficulties should it strengthen further.  Currency pairs such as \u201cthe euro-franc, which had low\nvolatility last year as it was constrained by central-bank\npolicy, should see more volatility as there is now a two-way\ntrade with the franc not just viewed as a safe haven,\u201d  Daragh Maher , a foreign-exchange strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc, said\nin a Jan. 16 interview.
