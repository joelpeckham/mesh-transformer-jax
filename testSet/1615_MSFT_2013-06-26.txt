 "context": "The following article called 'FTC Calls for Clear Distinguishment of Ads in Searches' was published on 2013-06-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission\nhas a message for  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  and other Internet\ncompanies: make sure online ads are clearly distinguished from\nregular Web-search results to avoid misleading customers.  The FTC, updating recommendations in place for more than a\ndecade,  said  search sites are displaying advertising more\nprominently on pages while doing less to highlight it. That has\nmade it difficult for users to distinguish ads from results that\naren\u2019t backed by ad dollars, the FTC said. The regulator\nlamented a \u201cdecline in compliance\u201d with guidelines from 2002.  \u201cIn recent years, the features traditional search engines\nuse to differentiate advertising from natural search results\nhave become less noticeable to consumers,\u201d the FTC  wrote  in a\nsample letter posted on its website, dated June 24. \u201cWe\nencourage you to review your websites or other methods of\ndisplaying search results, including your use of specialized\nsearch, and make any necessary adjustments to ensure you clearly\nand prominently disclose any advertising.\u201d  Search engines such as Google and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) \u2019s Bing\nhave been seeking new ways to make money from advertising that\u2019s\ntied to the keywords users type in when they\u2019re scouting out\ninformation on the Web. Google has parlayed its lead in the\nInternet-search market to help it become the largest online\nadvertiser in the world, according to EMarketer Inc.  Other companies receiving the FTC letter include  AOL Inc. (AOL) \nand 17 providers of search in areas such as shopping, travel and\nlocal business.  \u2018Deceptive Practice\u2019  To distinguish ads from natural results, the FTC recommends\nthat search engines use darker shading or more prominent borders\nto delineate marketing messages. The search engines also could\nuse \u201ctext labels\u201d that are clear and large enough for\nconsumers to notice.  \u201cFailing to clearly and prominently distinguish\nadvertising from natural search results could be a deceptive\npractice,\u201d the FTC  said .  The guidelines follow an FTC decision to close a review of\nGoogle\u2019s search business in January without taking action. The\nFTC voted 5-0 to end the investigation into whether Google\nunfairly skewed its search results to hobble competition.  Google said it would remove restrictions on use of its\nonline search advertising platform and that it would offer\ncompanies the option of keeping their content out of Google\u2019s\nsearch results.  -- Editors: Jillian Ward, Tom Giles  To contact the reporter on this story:\nBrian Womack in  San Francisco  at \n bwomack1@bloomberg.net ;  To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nTom Giles at \n tgiles5@bloomberg.net ;\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Microsoft Corporation was 28.453643798828125 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Microsoft Corporation was ",
