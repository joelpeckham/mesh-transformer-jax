The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRobert E. Elberson, the Hanes Corp.\nexecutive who introduced L\u2019eggs, the pantyhose sold in unique\negg-shaped containers, and made it the best-selling U.S. hosiery\nbrand by marketing it in supermarkets and drugstores, has died.\nHe was 84.  He died on Feb. 26 at his home in Charlotte, North Carolina,\naccording to the  website  of Hankins & Whittington Funeral\nService. No cause of death was given.  On his way up the corporate ladder to chief executive\nofficer of Hanes Corp. and then president of its parent, Sara\nLee Corp., Elberson played a role in the creation of one of\nAmerica\u2019s most distinctively packaged and displayed brands.  \u201cNothing beats a great pair of L\u2019eggs\u201d went its famous\nmarketing campaign.  As Forbes magazine recounted in a 1980 article, Elberson\ndiscovered as president of Hanes\u2019s hosiery division in 1968 that\nthe company was still relying on department-store sales even\nthough pantyhose was becoming big business in supermarkets and\ndrugstores.  A market analyst tasked by Elberson to study Hanes\u2019 hosiery\ncompetition reported a highly fragmented market in food and drug\nstores. So Elberson, in what Forbes called \u201chis methodical,\nbuilding-block way,\u201d then asked an advertising agency to design\na hosiery product with a memorable name and consistent quality\nthat was easy to keep in stock and wouldn\u2019t share a rack with\nthe competition.  Idea Hatched  The designer, Roger Ferriter of Herb Lubalin Inc.,\n\u201ccompressed a pair of pantyhose in his fist and noticed that\nthe package would be an egg,\u201d which he realized rhymed with leg,\nwhich could be rendered with a French flair as L\u2019egg, Rob\nWallace and Bronwen Edwards  wrote  in \u201cReally Good Packaging\nExplained\u201d (2009).  As Elberson had wished, the egg-shaped product required a\ndisplay that wouldn\u2019t hold competitors\u2019 hosiery. To make sure\nthe displays were always full, Elberson distributed L\u2019eggs to\nstores on consignment, with Hanes representatives responsible\nfor keeping them stocked.  The system worked so well, Forbes reported, that Elberson\ncut short a planned year-long test and began rolling out the\ndisplays nationally in the fall of 1970.  \u201cWe have the entire country gridded by square block,\u201d\nElberson said in 1980, according to Forbes. \u201cWe know where\nevery rack of L\u2019eggs is. Our competition has underestimated the\neffectiveness of these elaborate controls.\u201d  Takeover History  Hanes was acquired in 1979 by Chicago-based Consolidated\nFoods Corp., which in 1985 changed its name to Sara Lee Corp.\nSara Lee in 2006 spun off its apparel business into  Hanesbrands\nInc.

He earned an undergraduate degree in engineering from\nPrinceton University in New Jersey and a master\u2019s in business\nadministration from Harvard University in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, joining Hanes in 1954 following two years in the\nU.S. Air Force, according to a 1978  New York  Times  profile .
