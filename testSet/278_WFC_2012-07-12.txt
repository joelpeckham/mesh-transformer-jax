 "context": "The following article called 'Wells Fargo Faces Borrower\u2019s \u2018Force-Placed\u2019 Insurance Suit' was published on 2012-07-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWells Fargo Bank NA was accused in a\nlawsuit of charging inflated premiums when it procures \u201cforce-\nplaced\u201d property insurance for homeowners whose coverage has\nlapsed.  \u201cThe premiums are inflated to cover kickbacks in the form\nof unearned commissions and bundled administrative costs not\nproperly charged to the consumer,\u201d  Florida  homeowner Ira\nFladell said in a complaint filed yesterday in federal court in\n Fort Lauderdale , Florida.  Fladell, seeking unspecified money damages, claims the bank\nbreached its contract with him and acted in bad faith. He also\nsaid the lender bought a flood insurance policy on his Pompano\nBeach home while his own coverage was still in effect. Fladell,\na lawyer, is seeking class-action status on behalf of all\nborrowers in the same situation.  Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for the lender, didn\u2019t\nimmediately reply to a voice-mail message seeking comment on the\nlawsuit.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the San Francisco-based parent company\nof the Wells Fargo bank, today agreed to pay $125 million to the\nU.S. to settle unrelated allegations of bias against minority\nborrowers.  Shares fell 42 cents to $32.85 in  New York  Stock Exchange\ncomposite trading.  Fladell\u2019s filing came on the same day a U.S. judge in\n Oregon  ruled that another class-action lawsuit raising similar\nallegations against a unit of  Charlotte , North Carolina-based\n Bank of America Corp . can go forward on two of seven claims.  Contract Breach  U.S. District Judge Michael Simon in  Portland  said\nborrowers Ronda and Larry Arnett could proceed with breach of\ncontract and conversion claims, while he threw out allegations\nof unjust enrichment and breach of fiduciary duty.  The Arnetts, like Fladell, said they had flood insurance\ncoverage in force when the bank declared they were under-\ninsured, procured a policy for $250,000 coverage, the same\namount as the old one, then billed the Arnetts\u2019 escrow account\nfor the $2,448 premium, according to Simon\u2019s ruling.  They claim the bank forces class members to buy and\nmaintain flood insurance in amounts exceeding the requirement of\nU.S. law and greater than the lenders\u2019 secured property\ninterests.  Money Refunded  The judge said in his ruling that the premium money has\nbeen refunded. Still, the contract language the bank allegedly\nrelied upon to deem the borrowers under-insured was ambiguous,\nhe said, denying the bank\u2019s bid for judgment in its favor.  \u201cBank of America is pleased the court dismissed five of\nthe plaintiffs\u2019 seven claims and intends to continue its defense\nof the remaining claims against it,\u201d  Shirley Norton , a\nspokeswoman for the lender, said in an e-mailed statement.  The Florida case is Fladell v. Wells Fargo Bank NA, 12-\ncv-61368, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida\n(Fort Lauderdale). The Oregon case is Arnett v. Bank of America\nNA, 11-cv-1372, U.S. District Court, District of Oregon\n(Portland).
