 "context": "The following article called 'Yum to Invest $10 Billion With Partners in Emerging Markets Push' was published on 2013-10-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nYum! Brands Inc. (YUM) , the owner of the\nKFC and Taco Bell fast-food chains, and its partners will spend\n$10 billion over the next seven years adding restaurants in\n emerging markets  to tap increasing demand for eating out.  The investments will help Yum increase its outlets in these\ncountries to more than 20,000, Chief Executive Officer David Novak said in an interview yesterday. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company, which opened its 40,000th store in Goa, India,\nsaid sales from its own and franchise outlets in the South Asian\nnation will reach $1 billion by 2015.  Yum has said that faster economic expansion in emerging\nmarkets will help accelerate growth of its business. Novak is\ncounting on the Western appeal of his restaurants combined with\nsome local cuisine to woo increasing numbers of people who are\ndining out as incomes increase in these countries.  \u201cWe\u2019re on the ground floor of global growth in a lot of\ncountries, particularly the emerging markets,\u201d Novak said,\nspeaking in Goa. \u201cIn the United States, for instance, we have\n58 restaurants for every million people. In emerging markets, it\nis two.\u201d  The restaurant chain operator sees opportunities in  India ,\nChina,  Africa ,  Russia ,  Indonesia ,  Vietnam  and  Brazil , Novak\nsaid. About 25 percent of the investment in emerging-markets\nexpansion will be made by Yum, while the rest will come from its\nlocal franchise partners, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Grismer said yesterday.  \u2018Bounce Back\u2019  Novak said the company will \u201cbounce back\u201d in China, after\nsame-store  sales  in the third quarter dropped there. Yum plans\nto open at least 700 restaurants next year in the Asian nation,\nits biggest market, he said.  A large proportion of those new outlets will be in small\ncities and towns, where the economics are \u201cmore favorable,\u201d\nGrismer said.  Yum, which has more than 6,000 local KFC, Pizza Hut and\nother stores and gets about half its revenue from  China , on Oct.\n9 cut its forecast for 2013 earnings, citing \u201clower-than-expected China sales and a higher-than-expected full-year tax\nrate.\u201d  Full-year earnings  excluding certain items will decline at\na \u201chigh-single to low-double-digit\u201d percentage rate from the\nprior year, the company said. Yum also cut its forecast for\nChina saying it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d fourth-quarter same-store sales\nthere will be positive.  Avian Flu  The restaurant operator is facing a backlash from consumers\nin China after an outbreak of avian flu scared diners away from\npoultry and a former chicken supplier was investigated for\nselling food with too much antibiotics. Sales at Chinese stores\nopen at least 12 months fell 11 percent last quarter at Yum\neateries.  The company in November will introduce a new KFC\nadvertising campaign in China about quality assurance, Novak\nsaid on Oct. 9. The ads will feature store employees and\nsuppliers such as poultry farmers, he said.  \u201cWe view what\u2019s going on in China as a short-term issue,\u201d\nNovak said. The company plans to introduce new products next\nyear that are \u201ca combination of KFC-type foods and local\nChinese options,\u201d he said.  Yum will have more than 1,000 KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell\noutlets in more than 100 cities by 2015 in India, up from about\n613 now, it said in a statement yesterday. The company, which\ngets more than three quarters of its sales outside the U.S.,\nplans to open 1,450 new restaurants in emerging markets this\nyear.  The fast-food company gets less than 1 percent of its\n revenue  from India, where CLSA said the market for restaurant\nchains will grow to $6.5 billion by 2018.  Yum is developing menus in India to cater to local tastes,\nsaid Novak. It sells rice balls with curry flavor and chicken\nthat\u2019s spicy, he said.  International chains from  Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. (DPZ)  to Yum and\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp. have been adding new restaurants for the last\ndecade as Indians have gotten wealthier and developed a taste\nfor western style fast food. Among emerging markets, India has\nthe third-largest number of U.S. fast-food establishments,\naccording to Bloomberg Rankings.
