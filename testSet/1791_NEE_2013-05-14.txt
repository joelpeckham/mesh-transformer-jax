The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLos Angeles \u2019s power utility, which\nserves about 1.5 million customers, will seek bids from\ndevelopers for 250 megawatts of solar power to comply with a\n California  requirement to get 25 percent of its energy from\nrenewable sources by the end of 2016.  The Los Angeles Department of Water & Power plans to issue\na request for proposals in June, Anh Wood, who manages three of\nthe utility\u2019s solar development programs, said today by\ntelephone. Its board may approve contracts in the first quarter\nof 2014, she said.  The four biggest planned installations, totaling 200\nmegawatts of capacity, will be built on parcels at the utility\u2019s\nBeacon project in Kern County, California, purchased in December\nfor $31.5 million. The previous owner  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  had\nproposed in 2008 developing a 250-megawatt solar-thermal power\nplant on the site, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The utility now plans to build a 50-megawatt segment and to\nuse photovoltaic panels, while developers that plan to build the\nremaining four segments must bid for 25-year power sales\ncontracts at no more than 8.5 cents a kilowatt-hour, she said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll get good pricing from the sheer fact that this\nproperty already comes with all the environmental work that\u2019s\nalready done,\u201d Wood said. \u201cA lot of the liability that comes\nfrom project development is already taken care of.\u201d  Bids for the larger sites will be bundled with proposals to\nbuild 50 megawatts of rooftop systems on buildings in the Los\nAngeles area, as the final component of the utility\u2019s 150-megawatt feed-in tariff program, Wood said. The price for those\n20-year contracts will be capped at 14 cents a kilowatt-hour,\nand it\u2019s possible one company could get all the deals, she said.  \u201cEven though we have four contracts that we can sign,\npotentially there could be one winner.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAndrew Herndon in  San Francisco  at \n aherndon2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nReed Landberg at \n landberg@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of NextEra Energy, Inc. was 14.819784164428711 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of NextEra Energy, Inc. was ",
