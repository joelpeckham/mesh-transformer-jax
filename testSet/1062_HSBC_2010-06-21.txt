 "context": "The following article called 'Corporate Bond Sales Return as Swap Spreads Narrow' was published on 2010-06-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCorporate bond sales are back to\nlevels not seen since April as interest-rate swap spreads show\ninvestors are gaining confidence that Europe\u2019s debt crisis is\ncontained.  \n Total SA , Europe\u2019s third-largest oil producer, and Petah\nTikvah, Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. led\n$36.1 billion of global sales last week, the most since the\nperiod ended April 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nEven the riskiest debt is staging a comeback, with cognac maker\n Remy Cointreau SA  raising 205 million euros ($254 million) from\nthe first European junk bond offering in a month.  \n Markets are moving past concern that the euro region\u2019s\nstruggle with budget deficits will undermine the global economic\nrecovery and make it harder for borrowers to meet debt payments.\nSince April 1, equity analysts have boosted their second-quarter\nearnings estimates for companies in the  Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\nIndex  to $19.72 per share from $19.11, according to JPMorgan\nChase & Co.  \n \u201cWe could see further issuance in the next month if the\noverall tone of the market stays positive,\u201d said  Felix Freund ,\na money manager at Frankfurt-based Union Investment GmbH who\nhelps oversee 160 billion euros.  \n Investors put $164 million in high-yield bond funds in the\nweek ended June 16 after withdrawing $6.27 billion in the five\nprevious periods, according to EPFR Global, a Cambridge,\nMassachusetts-based research firm that tracks asset allocations.  \n \u2018Improved Tone\u2019  \n \u201cIt\u2019s a confirmation of the improved tone we\u2019ve seen over\nthe last few days,\u201d said  Martin Fridson , a global credit\nstrategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management in New York. \u201cIt\nlooks like some deals that had been talked about but put on the\nback-burner will start to re-emerge.\u201d  \n One measure of investor fear, two-year interest-rate swap\nspreads, fell to 33.93 basis points today, the narrowest since\nMay 13 and down from 52.25 on May 24. Swap spreads reflect the\ndifference between the rate to exchange floating for fixed\ninterest payments and Treasury yields for two years.  \n Elsewhere in credit markets, yield spreads for company\nbonds globally ended last week at an average 196 basis points,\nor 1.96 percentage points, down from 201 on June 11 and the\nfirst decline since the period ended May 14, according to Bank\nof America Merrill Lynch\u2019s Global Broad Market Corporate Index.\nThe yield on the index, which tracks 8,516 issues, is 4.1\npercent.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s likely that spreads will grind tighter on more days\nthan not,\u201d JPMorgan credit strategists led by  Eric Beinstein \nsaid in a report dated June 18. \u201cBut the list of risks isn\u2019t\ndiminishing.\u201d  \n Credit-Default Swaps  \n Benchmark indicators of credit risk fell in the U.S. and\nEurope. The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of\ncredit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against\nlosses on corporate debt or speculate on creditworthiness,\ndeclined 4.5 basis points to a mid-price of 105.4 basis points\nas of 11:48 a.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. In\nLondon, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of swaps on 125 companies\nwith investment-grade ratings fell 5.1 basis points to 112.5,\nMarkit prices show.  \n Both indexes typically fall as investor confidence improves\nand rise as it deteriorates. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer\nface value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the\nvalue of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000\nannually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  \n One Bryant Place  \n Bank of America Corp.  and  JPMorgan  are marketing $650\nmillion of 10-year securities tied to debt on a New York office\ntower in the third sale of commercial-mortgage backed securities\nthis year.  \n The bonds are backed by mortgage payments on One Bryant\nPark in midtown Manhattan, which houses the main office in the\ncity for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America,\naccording to a person familiar with the offering who declined to\nbe identified because terms aren\u2019t public.  \n The offering will bring total sales of commercial mortgage-\nbacked securities in 2010 to about $1.67 billion, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg.  \n The  S&P/LSTA US Leveraged Loan 100 Index , which tracks the\n100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans,  rose \n0.57 cent to 88.79 cents on the dollar last week. The index has\nlost 3.2 percent this quarter after  gaining  4.7 percent in the\nfirst three months.  \n Corporate Bond Returns  \n Returns on corporate bonds as measured by the Bank of\nAmerica index average 0.19 percent this month, after losing 0.4\npercent in May. The year-to-date return is 3.82 percent,\ncompared with a loss of 3.13 percent for the  MSCI World Index  of\nstocks.  \n Royal Dutch Shell Plc plans to sell five-year bonds in\ndollars, a banker involved in the transaction said today. Bank\nof America and HSBC Holdings Plc are managing the note sale,\nwhich are being sold through Shell International Finance BV, the\nbanker said.  \n The corporate bond market is gaining strength after sales\nslumped in May to the slowest since 2003. Issuance collapsed as\ninvestors grew concerned that budget deficits in Greece,\nPortugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain would escalate into a credit\ncrisis reminiscent of the subprime-mortgage meltdown that pushed\n Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  into bankruptcy in 2008.  \n Spain\u2019s successful 3.5 billion-euro bond auction and\nEuropean policy makers\u2019 pledge to publish stress tests to boost\ntransparency in the financial industry sparked rallies in stocks\nand bonds last week.  \n Markets Rally  \n The euro has strengthened 2.4 percent to $1.2399 since June\n11, paring its 13.5 percent decline this year. European Union\nleaders agreed to disclose how banks perform on stress tests,\nseeking to show investors that the financial system can\nwithstand shocks.  \n \u201cRisk appetite is slowly on the rise for all the various\nrisky asset classes, from equities to credit, and even the\neuro,\u201d said  Suki Mann , head of Societe Generale SA\u2019s credit\nstrategy group in London, who recommends investors buy corporate\ndebt. \u201cThe primary market remains the preferred re-entry\npoint\u201d for investors, he said.  \n PSA Peugeot Citroen, France\u2019s largest automaker, started\nselling 500 million euros of five-year bonds today to refinance\nexisting debt that may yield 5.75 percent to 5.875 percent,\naccording to a banker involved in the deal.  Volkswagen AG ,\nEurope\u2019s No. 1 carmaker, is issuing three-year bonds in euros\nthrough Volkswagen Bank, bankers involved in the sale said.  \n Hertz Global Holdings Inc. , the world\u2019s biggest rental-car\ncompany said today it plans to raise 275 million euros through\nan offering of senior junk bonds.  \n Total\u2019s Offering  \n Total raised $2.5 billion in its biggest offering in\ndollars, Bloomberg data show. The sale was split evenly between\n3 percent notes due in 2015 that yield 110 basis points more\nthan Treasuries and 4.45 percent bonds due in 2020 that pay a\nspread of 130 basis points. Paris-based Total sold the notes\nthrough its Total Capital SA unit.  BP Plc , embroiled in\ncontroversy over the worst oil leak in U.S. history, and  Royal\nDutch Shell Plc  are the two biggest European energy companies by\nsales.  \n Teva, the world\u2019s biggest generic-drug maker, sold $2.5\nbillion of debt in a three-part sale, Bloomberg data show. The\noffering consisted of 18-month floating-rate notes and two- and\nfive-year fixed-rate debt. Proceeds will be used to repay debt\nfrom the 2008 acquisition of Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. and to\nhelp finance the purchase of Ratiopharm GmbH, Teva said in a\nfiling with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \n Remy Cointreau  \n U.S. corporate bond issuance rose 66 percent to $15.6\nbillion last week, the most in seven weeks, and sales in Europe\nclimbed to 10.3 billion euros from 8.4 billion euros, Bloomberg\ndata show.  \n \u201cIssuance may pick up, even if it\u2019s nothing near what we\nhad in March and April,\u201d said  Sabur Moini , who manages $1.3\nbillion of high-yield debt at Payden & Rygel in Los Angeles.\n\u201cPeople are getting more comfortable that southern Europe isn\u2019t\ngoing to implode and maybe things aren\u2019t as bad as people\nthought in mid-May.\u201d  \n Remy Cointreau, the maker of Remy Martin cognac and Bols\nliqueur, ended a one-month drought of junk bond issuance in\nEurope to sell 205 million euros of six-year bonds at a yield of\n5.18 percent, Bloomberg data show. The company said it planned\nto use proceeds from its first sale in more than four years to\nfund a tender offer for outstanding notes.  \n High-yield, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service and BBB- by Standard & Poor\u2019s.  \n Remy\u2019s new notes climbed 0.66 cent to 98.4 cents on the\ndollar just after they were issued, according to HSBC Holdings\nPlc prices on Bloomberg.  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Bryan Keogh  in London at \n bkeogh4@bloomberg.net ;\n Sonja Cheung  in London \n scheung58@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Total SA and Teva Pharmaceutical led $36.1 billion of global corporate bond sales last week.
