 "context": "The following article called 'Bonds Gain in Best Year Since `05 as Rally May End' was published on 2010-06-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGlobal bond returns may have nowhere\nto go but down after the best first half since 2005.  \n Investors who piled into Treasuries, bunds, gilts, and\nJapanese bonds on concern that Europe\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis\nwould derail global growth are finding the securities less\nappealing with yields at about the lowest on record. The\nemerging bearishness may be most apparent in the  $4.3 trillion-\na-day  market for U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, where no\nmaturity commands a premium.  \n That\u2019s a switch from a year earlier, when investors\nresorted to paying interest to borrowers while lending cash just\nto obtain Treasuries after the worst finance crisis since the\nGreat Depression. None of the securities are what traders call\non \u201cspecial\u201d in a sign that investors don\u2019t expect Europe\u2019s\nsovereign debt crisis will curb the global economic recovery,\naccording to data from GovPX Inc., a unit of ICAP Plc, the\nworld\u2019s largest inter-dealer broker.  \n \u201cNo one\u2019s freaking out,\u201d said  Jason Brady , a managing\ndirector at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, New\nMexico, which oversees $59 billion. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a much\nmore situation normal indicator than what we saw a couple years\nago when it was a horror show. As we\u2019ve gotten to lower yields\nin Treasuries, they\u2019ve gotten less interesting.\u201d  \n Yield Forecasts  \n Treasury 10-year note yields, the benchmark for everything\nfrom mortgages to corporate bonds, will climb to 3.74 percent by\nyear-end from 3.11 percent on June 25, based on a Bloomberg\nsurvey of forecasters. That would imply a loss of about 3.26\npercent as yields rise and note prices fall, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  \n The 10-year note yielded 3.04 percent at 9:57 a.m. in New\nYork.  \n Higher yields are also forecast for German bunds, U.K.\ngilts, Japanese bonds and debt from the rest of the Group of\nSeven nations, separate surveys of economists and strategists by\nBloomberg News show.  \n Government debt is \u201cour least-favored segment of the bond\nmarket,\u201d a team of strategists led by  Jeff Applegate , who\noversees about $1.8 trillion as chief investment officer for\nCiti Global Wealth Management in New York, said last week in the\nfirm\u2019s Global Investment Committee Monthly report for June. \u201cWe\nexpect to see higher yields once investor risk aversion recedes,\ncausing this sector of the bond market to underperform.\u201d  \n Leading the Gains  \n The benchmark 10-year Treasury note has returned 7.85\npercent this year, including reinvested interest, leading global\ngovernment bonds to a gain of 3.36 percent, according to Bank of\nAmerica Merrill Lynch indexes. That\u2019s the best start since the\nfirm\u2019s broadest sovereign debt index rose 3.77 percent in the\nfirst half of 2005.  \n Sovereign debt yields dropped to 2.10 percent on average\nlast week, within 3 basis points of the low of 2.07 percent\nreached on May 25, based on the firm\u2019s Global Sovereign Broad\nMarket Plus Index. The gauge tracks 1,165 bonds with a market\nvalue of $18.6 trillion.  \n Predicting higher yields has been a losing bet. At the\nstart of the year, the median estimate of 67 economists and\nstrategists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 10-year Treasury\nrates to rise to 3.9 percent by now.  \n Instead, slower inflation, worsening government finances in\nEurope and concern that Greece will default on its debt and send\nthe global economy into another recession led investors to seek\nthe safety of bonds issued by G-7 nations. The  MSCI World  Index\nof stocks has fallen 7.44 percent this year.  \n Rate Outlook  \n Federal Reserve policy makers won\u2019t raise interest rates\nuntil the first quarter of next year, based on the median\nestimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists this month.  \n After leaving its target rate for overnight loans between\nbanks in a record low range of zero to 0.25 percent on June 23,\nthe Fed said in a statement that \u201cfinancial conditions have\nbecome less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely\nreflecting developments abroad.\u201d It also reiterated that it\nwill keep rates low for an \u201cextended period.\u201d  \n \u201cWe need to really get some solid ground under us\u201d before\ncentral banks tighten monetary policy, said  David Ader , head of\ngovernment bond strategy at Stamford, Connecticut-based CRT\nCapital Group LLC. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are willing to make\nbets right now.\u201d  \n Low yields are helping governments finance their budgets\ndeficits more cheaply. The administration of  President Barack Obama  spent $248.2 billion in interest expense in the first\neight months of fiscal 2010 ending Sept. 30, up 16 percent from\n$214 billion in the same period of 2009 even though the amount\nof market debt outstanding rose 23 percent to $7.96 trillion,\nTreasury figures show.  \n German Growth  \n While reports last week showed housing sales in the U.S.\nfell, other data indicate concern the economy will slow may be\noverblown. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of\nconsumer sentiment increased to 76 for June, from 73.6 in May.  \n Germany\u2019s  Ifo institute  in Munich said last week its\n business climate index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives,\nincreased to 101.8 from 101.5 in May. That\u2019s the highest since\nMay 2008. Economists expected a decline to 101.2, according to\nthe median of 38 forecasts in a Bloomberg  survey .  \n Japan\u2019s Cabinet Office said June 10 the nation\u2019s  gross\ndomestic product  rose at an annualized 5 percent rate in the\nthree months ended March 31, the biggest gain since the second\nquarter of 2009. The median of 18 estimates in a Bloomberg\nsurvey of economists was for a 4.2 percent pace.  \n Diminishing Demand  \n Such data help explain why demand for Treasuries has\ndiminished in the repurchase agreement market.  \n That\u2019s a switch from recent years when the debt was in such\nhigh demand as credit markets froze that investors routinely\nlent cash for next to nothing just to obtain the securities\nthrough so-called repos, which securities firms use to finance\ntheir holdings.  \n \u201cThere are very few specials out in the market and that\u2019s\nbeen the case for quite a while now,\u201d said  Thomas Simons , a\nmoney-market economist in New York at Jefferies & Co., one of\nthe 18 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. \u201cAround month-\nend, quarter-end, and definitely year-end, they tend to heat up\nin the last few days but it\u2019s not like it used to be.\u201d  \n The overnight repo rate on the current two-year Treasury,\nthe 0.625 percent coupon security, closed the same as the\ngeneral-collateral rate of 0.25 percent on June 25, according to\nGovPX. A year earlier, the overnight rate was negative 0.05\npercent, while the general-collateral rate was 0.05 percent.  \n German Bunds  \n German bonds gained 6.69 percent this year, poised for the\nbest first-half performance since 1995, according to Bank of\nAmerica Merrill Lynch indexes. The gains pushed the yield on the\n10-year bund to 2.5 percent on June 8, the lowest since at least\nJanuary 1989, according to Bloomberg generic prices.  \n \u201cWe could see some calm return to the markets in coming\nmonths,\u201d said  Michiel de Bruin , who helps manage about $32\nbillion as head of European government bonds at the Dutch unit\nof F&C Asset Management in Amsterdam. \u201cI can\u2019t really see\nTreasury or bund yields falling much from current levels.\u201d  \n Ten-year bund yields are forecast to rise from 2.61 percent\nfrom 3.11 percent by the end of the year, according to the\nmedian estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  \n In the U.K., where bonds have returned 5.62 percent since\nDecember, 10-year yields will likely rise to 4.05 percent in six\nmonths from 3.38 percent last week, a separate poll shows.  \n Japanese Bonds  \n Japan\u2019s government bonds have handed investors a 1.5\npercent return this year. Ten-year yields, which touched 1.16\npercent on June 23, the lowest since Dec. 30, 2008, will climb\nto 1.39 percent from 1.15 percent, another survey shows.  \n Not even a pledge by new Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan \nto restrict borrowing and overhaul the tax system will keep\nyields from rising, according to  Shinji Nomura , chief debt\nstrategist in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc., a unit of\nJapan\u2019s third-largest banking group.  \n \u201cYields are too low to entice investors any longer,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cThe economy continues to recover after hitting bottom.\u201d  \n For many investors, riskier assets are just too attractive\nto ignore after lagging behind bonds, regardless of what the\neconomy does, according to  Richard Schlanger , who helps invest\n$18 billion in fixed-income securities as vice president at\nPioneer Investments in Boston.  \n \u201cI would not want to be a buyer, a long term investor, of\n10-year Treasuries at 3.09,\u201d said Schlanger, a money manager at\nthe firm. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to believe we can continue to rally\nin the Treasury market. Equities and commodities would be better\nplaces to put your money.\u201d  \n Schlanger forecasts 10-year Treasury yields may reach 3.5\npercent this year as the economy improves.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Mary Childs  in New York at \n mchilds5@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                                                 \n                     \n                     Enlarge image \n                     \n                     \n                       Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan during the G20 in Toronto  \n                       \n                         \n                           Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg \n                         \n                         Japan\u2019s government bonds have handed investors a 1.5 percent return this year. \n                       \n                     \n                                        \n           \n                     Japan\u2019s government bonds have handed investors a 1.5 percent return this year.
