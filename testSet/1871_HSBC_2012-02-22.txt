 "context": "The following article called 'Maersk Drops as China Manufacturing Slumps: Copenhagen Mover' was published on 2012-02-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S (MAERSKB) , whose\ncontainer line transports the most  consumer goods  from  Asia  to\n Europe , fell in Copenhagen trading after data showed Chinese\nmanufacturing may shrink for a fourth month.  Maersk  fell as much as  5.2 percent, the most in 10 weeks,\nmaking it today\u2019s biggest loser in the Copenhagen 20 Index. The\nstock retreated 2,080 kroner, or 4.4 percent, to 45,320 kroner\nat 12:59 p.m. in the Danish capital.  Maersk\u2019s container line, which has a market share of about\n26 percent of the Asia-to-Europe route, is struggling to stay\nprofitable as it deals with overcapacity and flagging consumer\ndemand for imports in Europe. China\u2019s February preliminary\nmanufacturing index was 49.7, suggesting a fourth consecutive\nmonth of contraction, according to data published by  HSBC\nHoldings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit Economics today.  \u201cWe expect a marginally negative result in 2012,\u201d for\nMaersk\u2019s container Line,  Jacob Pedersen , an analyst at Sydbank\nA/S, said today in a preview note on the Copenhagen-based\ncompany\u2019s earnings report due Feb. 27. \u201cContainer freight rates\ncollapsed in the fourth quarter and have reached new record-low\nlevels.\u201d  Neptune Orient Lines Ltd., the owner of Asia\u2019s third-\nlargest container line, today reported its biggest quarterly\nloss in at least 10 years. The Singapore-based company lost\n$320.4 million in the three months to Dec. 30, wider than the\n$123.6 million average loss estimate in a Bloomberg survey of\neight analysts.  To help restore profits, Maersk said Jan. 31 it may double\nfreight rates on Asia-Europe trade. The company followed up with\na Feb. 17 announcement that it will cut 9 percent of its\ncapacity on the route.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about earnings in the\ncontainer unit after the proposed rate increases and capacity\nreduction,\u201d Pedersen said. Still, he repeated an \u201coverweight\u201d\n recommendation  on Maersk shares, and said freight rates may\nrecover faster than the market expects this year.
