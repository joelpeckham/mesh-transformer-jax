The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n\u201cThe Bible,\u201d the History channel\nminiseries by \u201cSurvivor\u201d creator  Mark Burnett , drew the\nnetwork\u2019s biggest audience of the year in its premiere after a\nmonths-long campaign to promote the show to Christian audiences.  The first of five two-hour episodes drew 13.1 million\nviewers, New York-based History said yesterday in a statement.\nLast year\u2019s premiere of \u201cHatfields & McCoys,\u201d with 13.9\nmillion, was the network\u2019s most-watched program ever. History is\npart of A&E Television Networks LLC, owned jointly by  Walt\nDisney Co. (DIS)  and Hearst Corp.  Burnett, an avowed Christian, and his wife, \u201cTouched by an\nAngel\u201d star Roma Downey, shot the series over six months in\n Morocco  and enlisted pastors Rick Warren and Joel Osteen, and\nCardinal Donald Wuerl, Archbishop of  Washington , to connect with\nChristian audiences. The, strategy pioneered by  Mel Gibson  with\nhis theatrical film \u201cThe Passion of the Christ,\u201d culminated\nwith a presentation to 500 clergy on March 2.  \u201cWe believe our Bible series has the potential to reach\nnot only those who already go to church but could reach a whole\nnew generation of people who have never been to church,\u201d\nBurnett said in a video posted on  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s YouTube.\n\u201cPeople that may never have read the Bible will get to see\nthose Bible stories in this series.\u201d  To promote the series, Burnett reached out to Protestant\nand Roman Catholic church leaders, touting the project as a\nteaching aid for use in sermons and weekly study groups.\nGibson\u2019s \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d cost $30 million and\ngenerated $612 million in worldwide ticket sales, according to\nBox Office Mojo.  Small Budgets  Smaller faith-affirming films, such as \u201cFireproof\u201d  have\nalso successfully based marketing on outreach to churches, said\nTed Baehr, chairman of the Christian Film & Television\nCommission, a group that advises studios.  \u201cFireproof\u201d was made for $500,000 and had sales of $33.5\nmillion. Religious audiences trust a minister\u2019s recommendation\nmore than studio ads or reviews by mainstream critics, he said.  \u201cThe market exists. You\u2019ve just got to reach them through\nthe venues that they are using,\u201d Baehr said. \u201cYou have to get\nto what they watch and where they go.\u201d  At the March 2 meeting, Warren, head of Saddleback Church\nin  Lake Forest ,  California , told the audience of about 500 he\nwould shape his next five Sunday sermons around the series. He\nurged clergy, including others watching a webcast of the event,\nto do the same.  \u201cDon\u2019t miss this opportunity,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis is a\nwave. Part of leadership is catching the wave. God is about to\ndo something really great.\u201d  Easter Sunday  Episodes will air every week on History, culminating March\n31, Easter Sunday. Lifetime, another A&E Television Networks\nchannel, will air repeats of episodes.  The series was made for about $22 million, said Burnett,\nwho also produces reality shows including \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and\n\u201cThe Voice\u201d on  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) \u2019s NBC and \u201cShark Tank\u201d on\nDisney\u2019s ABC. Burnett said in the video his success paved the\nway for him to produce the series and recruit History as a\ndistribution partner.  \u201cAll of these No. 1 shows, five shows right now, that\nallowed us to go into the powers within Hollywood to say we\nwanted to make a faithful Bible miniseries,\u201d Burnett said on a\nFeb. 12 webcast for pastors. \u201cIt takes a level of that success\nwithin the television business and film to have people pay\nattention and give you a chance.\u201d  \u2018Exciting Footage\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019ve told the stories of the Bible in a way to grab\nviewers\u2019 attention and draw them in to want to know more,\u201d\nDowney said in the video. \u201cThe footage is exciting, it\u2019s\ncompelling, poignant and powerful. Our hope is this series will\nreach millions of people around the world.\u201d  The couple hired Portuguese TV star Diogo Morgado as Jesus,\nand used special effects firms that work on Hollywood films. In\naddition to producing and directing, Downey also stars as Mother\nMary.  The series will also be shown outside the U.S., and DVDs be\non sale in April, according to History. The scripts will bound\ntogether into a book and a portion will be edited into a\ntheatrically released film. Burnett and Downey also plan to make\nthe series available for religious education programs.  Disney, based in  Burbank , California, gained 0.9 percent to\n$55.80 yesterday in  New York .
