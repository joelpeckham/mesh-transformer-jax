 "context": "The following article called 'China\u2019s Stocks Poised to Extend Drop on Profit, Baer Says' was published on 2012-03-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChinese stocks  are poised to extend\ntheir slump as the slowing economy hurts earnings, according to\nBank  Julius Baer  & Co., which has about $286 billion in client\nassets worldwide.  Chinese equities will probably retreat unless there is\n\u201csignificant\u201d easing of monetary policy, Alan Lam, a Hong\nKong-based analyst at Julius Baer, said by phone yesterday. His\ncomments came after the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 2.7\npercent, the most in four months, as Societe Generale SA said\nChinese corporate profits won\u2019t grow at all this year. The gauge\nhas gained 3.9 percent this year, headed for the biggest\nquarterly gain in four.  \u201cIn the coming three months, the rally has ended,\u201d Lam\nsaid. \u201cThe economic slowdown will continue for a while and\nthere are overexpectations on policy. It\u2019s a fact that the\neconomic slowdown in  China  is negative on profitability.\u201d  The Shanghai Composite sank 7.9 percent since March 5 after\nPremier  Wen Jiabao  announced a 2012 economic growth target of\n7.5 percent, down from 8 percent over the past seven years. The\ngauge has slumped 7.3 percent this month after rallying 10\npercent in January and February. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises\nIndex (HSCEI)  of Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks has tumbled 11 percent\nin March, the second-biggest drop among 93 primary indexes\ntracked by Bloomberg.  The Shanghai Composite fell 1.4 percent today to the lowest\nlevel since Jan. 16. The Hang Seng gauge declined 1.6 percent,\nthe biggest drop since March 19.  \u2018Far Too Optimistic\u2019  Industrial companies posted their first January-February\nprofit decline since 2009, with  net income  dropping 5.2 percent\ncompared with a 34.3 percent gain a year earlier, the National\nBureau of Statistics reported on March 27. Companies from Air\nChina Ltd., the nation\u2019s biggest international carrier, to\nJiangxi Copper Co., the largest producer of the metal, reported\nearnings this week that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates.  The industrial profit figures suggest 2012 consensus\nearnings estimates for Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies are\n\u201cfar too optimistic,\u201d Guy Stear and Anthony Lee, strategists\nat  Societe Generale , wrote in a March 27 report. John-Paul Smith, Deutsche Bank AG\u2019s London-based emerging-market\nstrategist, said \u201crecent corporate data appears to support our\nbearish case.\u201d  \u201cAt the very least we are at the start of a transition or\nconsolidation period for both the economy and the corporate\nsector, which is likely to focus investor attention on the\ndeteriorating outlook for profits and  cash flow ,\u201d Smith wrote\nin an e-mail yesterday. The strategist cut Chinese stocks to\nunderweight from neutral last month.  Time To Buy  Of the 505 companies in the Shanghai Composite that have\nreleased annual earnings, profits have risen 17 percent on\naverage, trailing analyst estimates by 3.6 percent, according to\n data  compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an increase of 38\npercent in the previous year.  The Shanghai Composite was the worst performer among the\nworld\u2019s 10 biggest markets in 2010 and 2011, tumbling a combined\n33 percent, as the central bank increased  interest rates  and\nlenders\u2019 reserve-requirement ratios to tame inflation.  The sell-off in equities may be a good time to buy as the\ngovernment has room to cut rates and reserve ratios to avoid a\n\u201chard landing\u201d for the economy, said Saharat Chudsuwan, chief\ninvestment officer at Bangkok-based Tisco Asset Management Co.,\nwhich manages about $4.6 billion including Chinese equities.  Discount Valuations  Companies in the Shanghai Composite trade at 9.4 times\nestimated profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on\nJan. 6, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The Shanghai\ngauge trades at a 30 percent  discount  to the  Standard & Poor\u2019s\n500  Index\u2019s 13.5 times, the data show.  Stocks dropped across  Asia  yesterday on concern slumping\nearnings will be the latest drag on a Chinese economy that\u2019s\nalready facing risks from a European debt crisis that\u2019s eroding\ndemand for exports and Premier Wen\u2019s campaign to rein in  home\nprices . The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  slumped 0.9 percent today,\nextending yesterday\u2019s 0.5 percent drop.  \u201cA lot of Asian economies are intertwined with China,\u201d\nBharat Joshi, who helps oversee $10 billion as an assistant\ninvestment manager at Aberdeen Asset in  Kuala Lumpur , said in a\nphone interview yesterday. \u201cEveryone is quite dependent on the\nbig brother there. When China reports bad numbers and\ndisappointments in the market, it affects the region.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nWeiyi Lim in Singapore at \n wlim26@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDarren Boey at \n dboey@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 34.17353820800781 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
