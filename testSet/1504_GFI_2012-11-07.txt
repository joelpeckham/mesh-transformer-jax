 "context": "The following article called 'Harmony Profit Boosted by Highest Output in 10 Quarters' was published on 2012-11-07. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHarmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR) , Africa\u2019s\nthird-largest producer of the metal, said first-quarter profit\njumped almost fivefold as output climbed to the highest level in\n10 quarters and prices for the metal increased.  Net income rose to 522 million rand ($61 million), or 1.21\nrand a share, in the three months through Sept. 30, from 107\nmillion rand, or 25 cents, in the prior three months, the\nJohannesburg-based company said in a statement today.  Along with  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) ,\nHarmony is trying to boost output to mitigate labor-cost and\nelectricity-price increases and to benefit from increasing gold\nprices. Chief Executive Officer Graham Briggs plans to raise\nproduction to 1.7 million ounces in fiscal 2016 from an\nestimated 1.3 million ounces this fiscal year.  Harmony increased 6 percent, the most since May 24, to\n72.31 rand by the close in Johannesburg, making it the best\nperformer on the city\u2019s stock exchange after  Grand Parade\nInvestments Ltd. (GPL)   Production grew 8 percent to 321,924 ounces in the quarter\nfrom three months earlier. That\u2019s the highest in ten quarters,\nfinance director Frank Abbott told reporters on a call today.  Gold gained 2.5 percent to an average $1,653 an ounce\nduring the quarter from $1,612.73 in the prior quarter. It\nwouldn\u2019t be surprising if gold rose to $1,800 by the end of this\nyear, Briggs told reporters on a call. In local-currency terms,\nit may increase to about 470,000 rand to 490,000 rand a\nkilogram, he said. The metal traded at $1,714.03 an ounce as of\n5:17 p.m. in  London .  Strike Cost  Second-quarter production will probably be similar to the\nfirst, excluding an estimated 25,000-ounce loss from a strike at\nKusasalethu, which will affect this year\u2019s target, Briggs said.\nThe cost of the strike that lasted from Oct. 2 to Oct. 25 is\nestimated at about 325 million rand, Harmony said.  Pay strikes spread from South African platinum mines to\ngold, coal, iron-ore, chrome and diamond operations in the past\nthree months. The Association of Mining and Construction Union\nhas a \u201cstrong\u201d presence at Kusasalethu mine, where union\nrepresentation is being verified, Harmony said. AMCU has\nchallenged the dominance of the National Union of Mineworkers in\nthe platinum industry.  The NUM will likely remain a significant entity, Briggs\nsaid on the media call today. The NUM is an affiliate of the\nCongress of Trade Unions of South  Africa , an alliance partner of\nthe ruling African National Congress.  Wage Costs  Wage increases are costing the company about 10 million\nrand a month more than before, Briggs said on the call. Harmony\nmines about 90 percent of its metal in South Africa and is\ninvesting in existing and new projects in Papua New Guinea.\nLabor represents about half of Harmony\u2019s costs while electricity\naccounts for an average 16 percent, Briggs said.  Harmony was least affected by strikes at South Africa\u2019s\nlargest producers also because the company has a different pay\nstructure, Briggs told investors on a call. Harmony\u2019s basic pay\nis typically lower and variables higher, so employees benefited\nin the past quarter as production rose, he said.  Larger rivals AngloGold and Gold Fields had all of their\nSouth Africa mines idled by labor stoppages last month. Most of\nthe operations have resumed. Only one Harmony mine had a strike.  There is a \u201cnew era\u201d in human resources management,\nBriggs told investors on a call today. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be\nmaybe as predictable as it has been in the past,\u201d he said of\nlabor engagement. \u201cMaybe having another union in the board room\nisn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing,\u201d he said.  Tax Payment  Earnings excluding one-time items of 1.23 rand a share\ncompared with a loss of 6 cents in the previous quarter. The\nmedian  estimate  of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for\nprofit of 1.22 rand a share on this basis.  Harmony\u2019s first-quarter earnings also improved after a\nhigher tax payment wasn\u2019t repeated, Abbott said. Analysts who\ncover South African gold producers measure quarter-on-quarter\nperformance on an earnings excluding one-time items basis.  A crusher upgrade at Hidden Valley mine in Papua New Guinea\nshould be completed next month and throughput could be\nnormalized by March, Briggs said.
