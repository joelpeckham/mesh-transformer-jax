The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLeBron James finished with 27 points and 12 assists as the host Cleveland Cavaliers sprung to life with a 116-86 win against the Boston Celtics in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals on Saturday night.\nKyle Korver had 14 points and Kevin Love added 13 with 14 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who lost the first two games of the series on the road in Boston. George Hill totaled 13 points, JR Smith had 11 and Tristan Thompson scored 10.\n\u201cI have a huge responsibility for this team,\u201d James told the ABC broadcast after the game. \u201cI have to score, I have to rebound and defend, make sure guys get involved, and I\u2019m OK with that. I\u2019m absolutely OK with that.\n\u201cI also have to inspire my teammates to be better. They answered the call tonight, and they need to answer the call at another time (in Game 4) on Monday.\u201d\nJayson Tatum scored 18 points to lead Boston. Terry Rozier contributed 13 points and both Jaylen Brown and Greg Monroe finished with 10 for the Celtics, who dropped to 1-5 on the road this postseason.\nBoston, which is a perfect 9-0 at home in the playoffs, was trying to become the third team ever to take a 3-0 series lead against a James-led squad, which has only been accomplished by the 2007 San Antonio Spurs and the 2017 Golden State Warriors.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take away from their performance by talking about us,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cThey deserve all the credit. They deserve to be talked about, because they played great.\u201d\nCleveland shot 48.7 percent (37 of 76) for the game and 50 percent (17 of 34) from 3-point range while outrebounding the visitors 45-34. Boston was limited to 39.2 percent (29 of 74) shooting, going 6-for-22 (27.3 percent) from 3.\nThe Cavaliers led 61-41 at halftime.\nBoston, which never led, fell behind by as many as 30 after that. Cleveland\u2019s lead never shrank below 19 in the second half.\nTerry Rozier\u2019s layup with 9:26 left in the first quarter had the Celtics within three, but James\u2019 layup at the 9:03 mark sparked a 13-0 run that put Cleveland ahead 20-4. The Cavaliers were up 32-17 after the first.\nJames improved to 13-0 in the playoffs when his team has led by 15 or more after one quarter.\n\u2014Field Level Media\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) was 79.76602935791016 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (Holding Co) was ",
