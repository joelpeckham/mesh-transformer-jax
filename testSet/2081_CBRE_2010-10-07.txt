The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFrankfurt\u2019s office property market\nwill probably attract the most investment this year since 2007\nas the strengthening economy fuels demand for space,  CB Richard\nEllis Group Inc.  and  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc . said.  Investors spent about 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) on\noffice purchases in Germany\u2019s main financial center in the first\nnine months, 36 percent more than in all of 2009, according to\nthe commercial property brokers. Spending in the fourth quarter\nalone may match the total for the previous three.  \u201cDemand has been rising enormously since the spring,\u201d\nBurkhard Plesser, CBRE\u2019s head of investment in Frankfurt, said\nin an interview. \u201cInvestors are looking for good locations and\nlong leases.\u201d  Confidence among German businesses and consumers is at a\nthree-year high. The economy, Europe\u2019s largest, grew 2.2 percent\nin the second quarter, the most since reunification 20 years\nago.  The amount of new space leased to tenants including the\nEuropean Central Bank and Allianz Global Investors rose 25\npercent in the first nine months of 2010 from a year earlier.\nInvestment spending may total about 2 billion euros for the\nwhole year, said  Marcus Lemli , head of leasing and capital\nmarkets at Jones Lang in Germany.  Investors spent 16.1 billion euros on offices in Frankfurt\nbetween 2005 and 2007. That slumped to 1.6 billion euros in\n2008 and 735 million euros last year, Jones Lang said.  \u2018Hot Spots\u2019  Next year, rental growth in Frankfurt is expected to be 2.9\npercent, driven by a lack of new developments, Savills Plc said\nin an Oct. 5 report. The London-based property broker added the\nFrankfurt and Munich office markets to its top five \u201chot\nspots\u201d for risk-averse investors.  Frankfurt\u2019s biggest transaction in the third quarter was\nthe 126 million-euro acquisition of the Fuerstenhof office\nbuilding by Deutsche Immobilien Holding AG, an investment\ncompany based in Delmenhorst, Germany. The property, mainly\noccupied by  Commerzbank AG , was sold by Hamburg-based Union\nInvestment Real Estate AG last month.  The attractiveness of German office properties is\nhighlighted by the 250 basis-point spread between the yield on\nthis type of building and the yield on 10-year government bonds.\nThat\u2019s the widest for at least 23 years, according to Jones\nLang, the second-largest publicly traded commercial property\nbroker after CBRE. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  It\u2019s not just Germans who are making purchases in\nFrankfurt. Foreign investors accounted for 40 percent of all\ncommercial real estate deals by value in the first half,\naccording to Savills.  Keeping Tenants  A drop in the number of commercial developments since the\ncollapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. two years ago has\nhelped German landlords keep their tenants.  \u201cThere has been very little reduction of space by the main\noccupiers,\u201d Lemli said. The number of deals will probably\n\u201cturn a lot faster than the market is expecting.\u201d  Until now, office values have recovered more slowly than in\nLondon and Paris, Savills said.  \u201cAs some investors get priced out of these markets, we\nforecast the next wave of significant yield compression will\noccur in German office stock, which is seeing increased investor\nfocus,\u201d Giles Wilcox, head of cross-border investment at\nSavills, said in an e-mailed statement Oct. 4.  New office space amounting to 371,000 square meters (4\nmillion square feet) was leased in the first nine months, more\nthan the 350,000 square meters leased in all of 2009, CBRE\nestimates.  Finance, Law  \u201cThe expansion has been driven by the financial sector and\nalso from law firms,\u201d said Richard Tucker, CBRE\u2019s head of\nFrankfurt leasing. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen this for two years.\u201d  The ECB is moving into a new headquarters, a building on\nthe site of a former wholesale market with space of 104,000\nsquare meters. It was biggest lease signed in the city so far\nthis year in terms of space.  Allianz Global agreed to lease 27,100 square meters, Tucker\nsaid. Parent Allianz SE, Europe\u2019s largest insurer, bought the\n10-story Triton office building from IVG Immobilien AG real\nestate funds in August. Its fund unit will occupy the space in\n2013 after refurbishments.  The Opernturm tower in Frankfurt will probably be bought by\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s asset-management unit for less than 600\nmillion euros, Handelsblatt reported on Oct. 5, citing people it\ndidn\u2019t identify. The 42-story building is owned by Tishman\nSpeyer Properties LP.  Rick Matthews , a spokesman for Tishman Speyer in New York,\nand  Kristen Chambers , a spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan Asset\nManagement in New York, had no immediate comment two days ago.  Higher Rents  Rents for the best office properties in Frankfurt\u2019s main\nbusiness district will probably rise to about 34 euros a square\nmeter next year from 33 euros in the first half of 2010,\naccording to Jones Lang.  Typically, German office leases last for five years.\nInvestors prefer those lasting 10 years or longer, especially\nfor lower-quality properties, Plesser said.
