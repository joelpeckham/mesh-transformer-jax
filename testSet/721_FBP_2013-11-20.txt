The company listed debt and assets of more than\n$100 million each in Chapter 11 documents filed yesterday in\n U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Tampa,  Florida , where it is based.  Scrub Island Development Group owns the island and resort\nof the same name nestled into the side of the smaller of two\nhalves of a 230-acre private island connected by a narrow strip\nof land. It\u2019s the first resort development built in the British\nVirgin Islands in more than 15 years, according to its  website .  FirstBank Puerto Rico (FBP) , the company\u2019s lender, is owed about\n$108 million, according to court documents. FirstBank initiated\na \u201chighly secretive appointment\u201d of a temporary receiver of\nthe Scrub Island Development Group\u2019s assets without prior notice\nto the company or its lawyers, the resort operator said in court\npapers.  The bank\u2019s request was granted on Nov. 1 by the Eastern\nCaribbean Supreme Court in the  High Court  of Justice, according\nto court documents. FirstBank can seek an extension of the\ncourt\u2019s ruling at a Nov. 28 hearing, the day after the temporary\nreceivership is set to expire.  Pursue Suit  To prevent the receiver from damaging its business and to\nterminate the court order, Scrub Island Development Group sought\nbankruptcy protection and said in court filings that it will\npursue a lawsuit against the bank for claims including breach of\ncontract, civil conspiracy, and unfair and deceptive trade\npractices.  The company said the bank engaged in unauthorized contact\nwith an executive at affiliated company Mainsail Lodging &\nDevelopment and obtained confidential information from the\nexecutive, who was later terminated, according to court\ndocuments. The executive isn\u2019t identified in the filing.  Josias N. Dewey, a lawyer for FirstBank  Puerto Rico , didn\u2019t\nimmediately return a phone call seeking comment on the resort\ncompany\u2019s allegations.  Mainsail Lodging & Development\u2019s president, Joe C. Collier\nIII, became involved in the design and development of Scrub\nIsland in 2005, according to court papers. Mainsail, which has\nthe same address as Scrub Island Development Group and whose\npresident signed the company\u2019s bankruptcy petition, was\ncontracted as the exclusive and sole developer and operator of\nthe resort.  Unsecured Creditor  Mainsail Management Group is the biggest unsecured\ncreditor, owed about $1.5 million, and its affiliates are also\nfour of the other top 10 unsecured creditors.  Scrub Island Development Group said in court papers current\nassets are on the books for about $2 million and non-current\nassets had a book value of $124.3 million, while an affiliate\nthat also filed for bankruptcy has assets worth about\n$10.6 million.
