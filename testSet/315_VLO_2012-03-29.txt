The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNovozymes A/S (NZYMB) , the world\u2019s largest\nmaker of enzymes, is considering broader partnerships in\ncellulosic ethanol projects to promote its technology as\ncompetition in the industry stiffens, an executive said.  The Danish maker of enzymes used in brewing, detergents and\nbiofuel may get involved in pilot or demonstration plants if\nthere was an \u201cappealing reason,\u201d Peder Holk Nielsen, who\noversees Novozymes\u2019s enzymes business, said in an interview.\nTalks with potential partners are under way, covering various\nlevels of cooperation, Nielsen said, declining to give details.  Novozymes is looking to go beyond customer rebates as more\ncompanies enter the field.  DuPont Co. (DD)  bought Danisco for $7.1\nbillion last year, expanding into the market of enzymes that let\nwashing machines clean at lower temperatures, or help extract\ncellulose from crop residues in second-generation biofuel.  Royal\nDSM NV (DSM)  announced a venture with Novozymes customer Poet LLC in\nJanuary, securing an enzyme contract in the process.  \u201cWe have been working with people around the world on\nother models,\u201d Nielsen said in the March 27 interview. \u201cWe\nhave a whole register of things we\u2019re ready to do. But we will\nnot get involved in the manufacture of ethanol for the sake of\nit. It\u2019s not our line of business.\u201d  DSM took a financial stake in a $250 million biofuel\nproject with Poet, and the Heerlen, Netherlands-based company is\nseeking more such tie-ups. Novozymes declined as much as 3.6\npercent on the day the partnership was announced.  Still in the Game  Novozymes, which spends about 14 percent of sales on\nresearch, aims to maintain a competitive edge to retain clients\nlike Poet as larger diversified chemical makers and startup\ncompanies enter the enzyme market.  Novozymes has a \u201cfirm\u201d supply contract with Poet for the\nproject, irrespective of DSM\u2019s involvement, said 55-year-old\nNielsen, who was appointed head of enzymes in 2007. The current\ncontract between Novozymes and Poet extends to 2017, and by then\nit will no longer be mandatory that DSM remains the sole\nsupplier to the joint venture, according to research by ABG\nSundal Collier.  DSM Chief Executive Officer Feike Sijbesma said in February\nthat Poet\u2019s existing contract with Novozymes will be\n\u201crespected\u201d and then phased out, with DSM supplying both the\nenzymes and yeast for the Emmetsburg, Iowa facility. The\nintention then is to license the technology to other ethanol\nproducers, and Poet\u2019s other plants, he said.  Biofuel Talks  Novozymes is working with more than 50 companies which are\nat various stages of development, Nielsen said. While some need\ncash, others just need the latest enzymes, and the level of\ninvolvement with Novozymes varies from just contact to \u201cdeep\ncollaborative efforts,\u201d he said.  The executive declined to comment on the potential of\npartnering with  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , cited as the best candidate\nfor Novozymes by DNB Markets analyst Rune Dahl.  Enzyme makers are seeking to help jump-start the cellulosic\nethanol market. The U.S.  Environmental Protection (1065)  Agency sets\nannual mandates for the amount of biofuel that must be blended\ninto gasoline, and has had to reduce the target for the past two\nyears because of a lack of commercial production of the fuel.  The Danish company predicts small growth in the U.S. corn\nethanol market this year. Its revenue stream will be bolstered\nby new products entering the market that increase the yield from\ncrops.  \u201cWith the way we view the world today, we wouldn\u2019t play it\nthe same as DSM has with Poet,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cThere will\nalways be competition and the best technology will always win.\nDSM have bought an entrance ticket with their joint venture with\nPoet. Now they have to prove they have the technology.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAndrew Noel in London at \n anoel@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nBenedikt Kammel at \n bkammel@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Valero Energy Corporation was 17.421504974365234 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Valero Energy Corporation was ",
