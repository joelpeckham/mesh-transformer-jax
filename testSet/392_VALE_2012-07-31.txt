 "context": "The following article called 'Rongsheng Faces Order Slump as SEC Probe May Deter Buyers' was published on 2012-07-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina Rongsheng Heavy Industries\nGroup Holdings Ltd. (1101) , which hasn\u2019t announced any 2012 ship\norders, may find winning deals even harder as a company owned by\nits billionaire chairman faces an insider-trading probe.  China \u2019s biggest shipbuilder outside state control tumbled\n16 percent yesterday in Hong Kong after the  U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission  said traders including Chairman Zhang Zhi Rong\u2019s Well Advantage Ltd. made more than $13 million of illegal\nprofits buying shares of Nexen Inc. ahead of a takeover\nannouncement by  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  The SEC also won a court order\nfreezing about $38 million of the traders\u2019 assets.  The investigation may deter customers from placing orders,\n Jon Windham , an analyst at Barclays Plc., said yesterday by\nphone. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very bad for the overall image of the\ncompany.\u201d He downgraded the stock to underweight from\nequalweight and cut its target price to HK$1.06 from HK$2.40.  Rongsheng, based in  Shanghai , has tumbled 87 percent since\na November 2010 initial public offering because of concerns\nabout delivery delays and a global slump in ship orders caused\nby a glut of vessels. The shipbuilder, which operates facilities\nin Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, also said yesterday that first-\nhalf profit probably dropped \u201csignificantly\u201d because of\nfalling prices and slowing orders.  The demand slump has pushed new-ship prices to an eight-\nyear low, according to shipbroker Clarkson Plc. Chinese shipyard\norders plunged 49 percent in the first half.  Shares Slump  Rongsheng dropped 8.6 percent to HK$1.07 as of the close in\nHong Kong trading today. The city\u2019s benchmark  Hang Seng Index \nrose 1.1 percent.  Kevin Chong, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, lowered his\ntarget price to HK$0.7 from HK$1.6 and maintained a sell rating.  The probe won\u2019t affect day-to-day operations run by Chief\nExecutive Officer Chen Qiang, as Chairman Zhang only has a non-\nexecutive role, Rongsheng said in a statement yesterday. Zhang\nwasn\u2019t available for comment yesterday, according to Doris\nChung, public relations manager at  Glorious Property Holdings\nLtd. (845) , a developer he controls.  Chen isn\u2019t aware of Zhang\u2019s personal business dealings and\nhe has no plans to leave Rongsheng, he said yesterday by text\nmessage in reply to Bloomberg News questions. The CEO may help\nreassure potential customers as he is well-known among\nshipowners, said Lawrence Li, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian\nHoldings Ltd.  Good Reputation  \u201cThey know that Chen Qiang is quite good,\u201d he said.\n\u201cStill, in the short term, shipowners may have some concerns\nabout the chairman\u2019s case.\u201d  Zhang owns 46 percent of Rongsheng and 64 percent of\nGlorious Property, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The\ndeveloper dropped 1.7 percent to close at HK$1.16 in  Hong Kong \ntoday after falling 11 percent yesterday. Zhang\u2019s listed\nholdings are worth about $1.2 billion, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Zhang, who holds a Master\u2019s of Business Administration\ndegree from Asia Macau International Open University, started in\nbuilding materials and construction subcontracting before\ngetting into real estate. Construction of his first project, in\nShanghai, began in 1996, according to Glorious Property\u2019s IPO\nprospectus. He got into shipbuilding after discussing the idea\nwith Chen at a Shanghai Young Entrepreneurs\u2019 Association event\nin 2001, according to Rongsheng\u2019s sale document. He formed the\ncompany that grew into Rongsheng three years later.  \u2018Legend\u2019 of Zhang  \u201cPeople in his hometown think Zhang is a legend as he\nexpanded two companies in different sectors so quickly,\u201d said\nJi Fenghua, chairman of Nantong Mingde Group, a shipyard located\nnext to Rongsheng\u2019s facility in Nantong city, Jiangsu province.\nThe billionaire maintains a low profile, said Ji, who has never\nseen him at meetings organized by the local government.  Rongsheng raised HK$14 billion in its 2010 IPO, selling\nshares at HK$8 each. The company\u2019s  market value  has fallen by\nabout $6.1 billion to $1 billion, based on data compiled by\nBloomberg.  The shipbuilder has had delays as it builds 16 of the\nworld\u2019s biggest commodity ships for  Vale SA (VALE5)  and Oman Shipping\nCo. It was supposed to hand over eight of the ships last year,\naccording to its IPO prospectus. Instead, it only delivered one.\nIt had handed over two more to Vale by May 20. The same month,\nit christened two for Oman Shipping, Xinhua reported.  The company\u2019s  cash reserves  have also declined. It had 6.3\nbillion  yuan  of cash and cash equivalents at the end of December\ndown from 10.4 billion yuan a year earlier. Its short-term\nborrowings rose to 18.2 billion yuan from 10.1 billion yuan,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Orders Outstanding  Rongsheng, which also makes engines and excavators, had\noutstanding orders for 98 ships as of June 2012, according to\nClarkson. It employed 7,046 people at the end of last year,\naccording to its annual report. The shipbuilder has built a\npipe-laying vessel for Cnooc and it has a strategic cooperation\nagreement with the energy company.  Well Advantage and other unknown traders stockpiled shares\nof Nexen before Cnooc announced plans to buy the Calgary-based\nenergy company for $15.1 billion, according to the SEC. The\nregulator acted to freeze accounts less than 24 hours after Well\nAdvantage placed an order to liquidate its position, it said.\nThe investigation continues, it said July 27.  The traders may have to pay multiples of the profit they\nmade from illegal deals to settle the case, based on previous\nincidents, said  David Webb , the founder of corporate-governance\nwebsite  Webb-site.com . The frozen accounts may make a settlement\nmore probable as the traders won\u2019t be able to access cash, he\nsaid. Still, there may be a long-term impact on reputations.  \u201cCases such as this bring the integrity of the persons\ninvolved into question,\u201d Webb said. \u201cAnd, if they are running\na bank or a listed company, then it tends to tarnish the firm\ntoo.\u201d  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:\nJasmine Wang in Hong Kong at \n jwang513@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nNeil Denslow at \n ndenslow@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of VALE S.A. was 11.094743728637695 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of VALE S.A. was ",
