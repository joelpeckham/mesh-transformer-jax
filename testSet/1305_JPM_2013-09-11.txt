 "context": "The following article called 'Egypt Yields Fall to 3-Month Low as Military Plan Gains Momentum' was published on 2013-09-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nYields on  Egypt \u2019s benchmark\nEurobonds fell to the lowest in more than three months as the\nmilitary\u2019s road map gained momentum 10 weeks after the overthrow\nof President Mohamed Mursi.  The 5.75 percent notes due April 2020 rose for a fifth day,\npushing the yield down 14 basis points, or 0.14 of a percentage\npoint, to 8.24 percent at 3:55 p.m. in Cairo, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. That takes the drop since Mursi\u2019s ouster\nJuly 3 to 253 basis points.  Egyptian bond yields are bucking the rising trend of  Middle\nEast  and emerging-market sovereigns this month as the country\nmoved closer to parliamentary elections by starting to amend its\nconstitution. The vote is schedule to take place in the first\nquarter of next year despite violence that has claimed the lives\nof more than 1,000 people in the aftermath of Mursi\u2019s ouster.  \u201cAs long as Egypt remains off the global TV screen, the\nbonds will do well because people get more confidence that there\nwill be a stable solution to the political crisis,\u201d Gabriel Sterne, senior economist at London-based Exotix Ltd., said by\nphone. \u201cBut you still have to wonder how any real vote that\nreflects the will of the Egyptian people can get around the\npopularity of the Islamists.\u201d  Islamists won more than 70 percent of seats in the\ncountry\u2019s 2012 parliament. The Muslim Brotherhood, the country\u2019s\nbiggest Islamist group and the main supporters of Mursi, has\nremained defiant of the military government despite a violent\ncrackdown by security forces and arrests of its top leaders. It\nhas rejected the military\u2019s plan and vowed to continue street\ndemonstrations until Mursi is restored to office.  Sovereigns Increase  The yield on Egypt\u2019s 2020 notes is down 64 basis points\nthis month. That compares with a seven basis-point increase for\nthe HSBC/NASDAQ Dubai Middle East Conventional Sovereign US\nDollar Bond Index to 5.53 percent yesterday.  JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (JPM) \u2019s  Emerging Markets  Bond Index, reflecting sovereign yields,\nrose four basis points in the same period to 6.2 percent.  The Egyptian pound was little changed at 6.8953 a dollar in\ninterbank trading, according to BNP Paribas MENA prices, after\nthe central bank sold $38.8 million at a currency sale. The\nregulator received 6.8853 pounds for dollars compared with\n6.8855 pounds on Sept. 9, according to its data on Bloomberg.  The pound is up 1.3 percent over the past week following\nthe central bank\u2019s record $1.3 billion auction, paring the\ncurrency\u2019s decline since the start of the sales in December to\n10 percent.
