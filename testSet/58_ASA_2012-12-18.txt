 "context": "The following article called 'Mortgage Risk Under Fire in Nordics as Bubbles Fought' was published on 2012-12-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSweden and  Norway  say their banks\nhave underestimated the risk in their mortgage portfolios and\nwill need to set aside more capital to guard against losses as\nthe two nations move to stop debt bubbles forming.  Norway\u2019s government said yesterday it wants to triple the\nrisk weights assigned to mortgage assets, bringing the minimum\nrequirement to 35 percent. That followed a similar decision in\nneighboring Sweden, where the regulator on Nov. 26 set the\nminimum risk-weight requirement at 15 percent, almost three\ntimes existing levels.  As central banks respond to the crisis in Europe with\ninterest rate cuts, households are amassing record amounts of\ndebt. In Norway, the world\u2019s fourth-richest nation per capita,\nprivate debt will swell to more than 200 percent of disposable\nincomes next year, while  Sweden \u2019s debt load hit a record 173\npercent this year, the countries\u2019 central banks estimate. That\u2019s\nputting pressure on regulators to ensure banks have buffers that\ncan withstand sudden adjustments in asset prices.  \u201cThere is a substantial risk that there is a housing\nbubble\u201d in Norway, Harald Magnus Andreassen, chief economist at\nSwedbank First Securities in Oslo, said in a phone interview.\n\u201cIf you look at a graph, you would be quite confident that\nsomething could be wrong.\u201d  Overvalued Assets  House prices in Norway have doubled since 2002 to reach a\nrecord, according to the Norwegian Association of Real Estate\nAgents. Sweden\u2019s National Housing Board has warned that the\nproperty market in the largest Nordic economy is in the grip of\na bubble. Bengt Hansson, an analyst at the board, estimates\nSwedish house prices are 20 percent overvalued, adjusting for\nthe effect of inflation.  \u201cThis is based on an optimism regarding rising prices in\nthe future and low interest rates in combination with very\ngenerous lending policies,\u201d Hansson said by phone yesterday.  Yet banks argue that stricter capital and risk-weight rules\nwill put them at a competitive disadvantage relative to their\nrivals elsewhere in Europe.  In Sweden,  Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ,  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , SEB AB and  Svenska\nHandelsbanken AB (SHBA)  already need to meet a minimum core Tier 1\ncapital requirement of 10 percent next year, rising to 12\npercent in 2015. That compares with the 7 percent set by the\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision.  Extra Capital  Risk weights, as defined by Basel II regulations, on\nmortgage loans in Norway are now 11 percent, compared with 15\npercent in  Germany  and as high as 35 percent in Spain, according\nto data provided by Sweden\u2019s central bank. Norway\u2019s proposed 35\npercent floor would be the highest in the Nordic region.  Raising risk weights to 15 percent in Sweden would force\nthe largest banks there to set aside an additional 20 billion\nkronor ($3 billion) in capital, the FSA estimates. Norway\u2019s\nregulator hasn\u2019t provided estimates for the cost to its banks.  Handelsbanken and Swedbank had core Tier 1 capital ratios\nat 17.9 percent and 17.3 percent, respectively, of their risk-\nweighted assets at the end of September. SEB\u2019s core Tier 1 ratio\nstood at 16.5 percent at the end of the third quarter, while\nNordea\u2019s was 12.2 percent.  DNB\u2019s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.4 percent\nof risk-weighted assets last quarter, not including so-called\ntransitional rules. The bank\u2019s shares slipped 1.1 percent\nyesterday, and lost a further 0.3 percent to trade at 70.05\nkroner as of 9:50 a.m. in Oslo.  Customer Pays  Lenders will respond by raising customer rates, Jan\nDigranes, head of the banking and capital markets department at\nFinance Norway, which represents about 180 financial\ninstitutions, said by phone from Oslo. \u201cBanks have to increase\ninterest rates to increase net earnings and they will have to\ndiscuss whether it will be necessary to issue more capital to\ncomply with the new requirements.\u201d   DNB ASA (DNB) , Norway\u2019s biggest bank, hasn\u2019t changed its\nfinancial targets based on yesterday\u2019s announcement. The\ngovernment\u2019s proposal, which the regulator is due to follow up\non in March, sets risk weights \u201ctoo high,\u201d DNB spokesman\nThomas Midteide said in an e-mailed reply to questions.  Both Sweden and Norway are pushing stricter regulatory\nrequirements after enduring a banking meltdown in the 1990s.\nThat credit event required the Swedish government to step in and\ntake control of toxic property loans. Nordea, Scandinavia\u2019s\nbiggest bank, is the product of a series of state-engineered\nmergers following that crisis.  Housing Adjustment  Household debt levels now are even higher than they were at\ntheir peak back then, according to  Michael Wolf , chief executive\nofficer of Sweden\u2019s largest mortgage lender Swedbank AB. Wolf\nsaid in a Dec. 4 interview that Sweden\u2019s housing market probably\nfaces \u201csome sort of adjustment.\u201d  Household debt levels in Norway and Sweden have continued\nto rise even after both countries introduced an 85 percent cap\non loans relative to property values. That\u2019s spurred discussion\namong central bankers on the extent to which monetary policy\nshould be deployed to curb housing-market imbalances. Swedish\ncentral bank Governor Stefan Ingves, who is also the chairman of\nthe Basel Committee, has argued in favor of using policy\ninterest rates to stem the threat of housing bubbles.  Yet Ingves, like his counterparts elsewhere in  Europe , is\nfinding his freedom to raise rates curtailed by the fallout of\nthe debt crisis further south. His bank cut its main rate today\nby a quarter point to 1 percent.  Policy makers in Norway and Sweden need to decide whether\nthe imbalances in their housing markets are temporary or long\nterm. That could guide them to the right response, according to\nAndreassen at Swedbank.  \u201cRisk weighting is more a structural argument, in the\nsense that if it is too cheap for banks to extend credit to\nhousing then you have a risk at all times to have too much\ndebt,\u201d he said. \u201cUsually you would think of the interest rate\nas a business cycle adjustment.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJosiane Kremer in Oslo at \n jkremer4@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJonas Bergman at \n jbergman@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was 20.58087158203125 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was ",
