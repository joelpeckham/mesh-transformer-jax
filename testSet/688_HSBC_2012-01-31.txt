 "context": "The following article called 'Diamond, Gulliver May Avoid Hester\u2019s Zero-Bonus Fate' was published on 2012-01-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBarclays Plc (BARC) \u2019s  Robert Diamond ,\nBritain\u2019s top-paid bank chief executive officer, will probably\nreceive his bonus even as his counterparts at state-backed\nlenders are forced to forgo theirs, analysts and investors say.  Diamond is the next executive likely to face scrutiny as\n Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  CEO  Stephen Hester  waived his\n963,000-pound ($1.5 million) bonus after the payout sparked a\npolitical and public backlash. RBS Chairman  Philip Hampton  also\nabandoned his 1.4 million-pound stock award.  \u201cThe pressure will probably stop at the government-\ncontrolled banks,\u201d said Guy de Blonay, a London-based fund\nmanager at Jupiter Asset Management Plc, which holds RBS shares.\n\u201cHester has taken a sensible decision in waiving his award. It\nwill allow him to continue to focus on his job.\u201d  Unlike RBS and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , where the U.K.\ntaxpayer is also the biggest shareholder, the government has no\nstakes in Barclays, HSBC Holdings Plc or  Standard Chartered  Plc,\nmaking it difficult for the state to exert bonus restrictions.\nInstitutional shareholders also have different priorities than\nthe government and the public, fund managers and analysts said.  \u2018The Larger Question\u2019  \u201cWe tend to focus this debate on the top people whose pay\nis made public,\u201d said George S.  Dallas , a director of corporate\ngovernance at F&C Management Ltd. in  London , which holds shares\nin all five of the U.K.\u2019s largest banks. \u201cAttention needs to\nfocus on that, but in banks the larger question is what is\nhappening below the boardroom -- the people whose names we don\u2019t\nsee?\u201d  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  said yesterday banks must\nshow \u201cproper regard\u201d in limiting bonuses. \u201cWhat needs to\nhappen is a sense of restraint,\u201d Cameron told reporters in\nBrussels after a meeting of European leaders. \u201cThey need to do\na better job of demonstrating how pay is related to\nperformance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I care about is the taxpayer\ngoing to get the money back.\u201d  The CEO of Britain\u2019s second-biggest government-aided bank,\nLloyd\u2019s Antonio Horta-Osorio, said on Jan. 13 that he also won\u2019t\ntake a 2011 bonus following his nine-week absence for\nexhaustion. The payment could have been as much as 2.39 million\npounds, according to company filings.  Bonus Pool Declines  London bankers are expected to receive 4.2 billion pounds\nin bonuses for 2011, the lowest in almost a decade as financial-\nservices firms face tougher regulations and post \u201cweak\u201d\nearnings, the Centre for Economics & Business Research Ltd. said\nin October.  \u201cIt looks like Barclays is next on the list, but it\u2019s the\nsame for all the banks,\u201d said Oliver Roethig, regional\nsecretary of UNI-Europa, a federation of European labor unions,\nincluding Britain\u2019s Unite and Accord. \u201cThe decision-making\nsystem to decide on bonuses is murky. We are all talking about\nmarket systems and if you look at how these bonuses have grown\ncompared with everyone else\u2019s this is a hint to market\nfailure.\u201d  Diamond, 60, was awarded a 6.5 million-pound bonus for 2010\nand a further 2.25 million pounds depending on the lender\u2019s\nperformance, London-based Barclays said in March. His base\nsalary rose to 1.35 million pounds from 250,000 pounds after he\nbecame CEO on Jan. 1 last year.  HSBC (HSBA)  CEO  Stuart Gulliver  received a 2.9 million-pound bonus\nfor 2010, less than the 6.5 million-pound bonus Barclays gave\nDiamond for the same year.  Gulliver\u2019s Compensation  HSBC,  Europe \u2019s largest bank, sought backing from investors\nto pay Gulliver as much as 13.3 million pounds for 2011,\nincluding 1.25 million pounds base salary, a bonus of as much as\nthree times his base salary and a long-term incentive payment\nequal to six times his salary, two people with knowledge of the\ntalks said in March. If awarded, it would make Gulliver the top-\npaid bank chief for 2011.  Spokesmen for Barclays and HSBC in London declined to\ncomment on bonus awards yesterday.  Barclays is due to report 2011 results on Feb. 10 and will\ndisclose pay proposals of its senior management with its annual\nreport in March. The bank is expected to post a pretax profit of\n5.87 billion pounds for 2011, down 3 percent from a year\nearlier, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts.  The  Association of British Insurers , which represents\ninvestors with about 1.5 trillion pounds of assets, wrote to\nbanks in December warning them to reduce pay.  Bank Shares Down  \u201cWe made clear in our letter to the U.K. banks in December\nremuneration costs as a proportion remain too high, particularly\nin an environment where we can expect lower returns from banks\nin the medium term,\u201d the ABI said last week. \u201cFailing to deal\nwith this issue will affect the investment case for banks.\u201d  The share price of Lloyds fell 61 percent last year while\nRBS declined 48 percent and Barclays 33 percent. HSBC dipped 25\npercent and  Standard Chartered (STAN)  about 18 percent.  Ultimately, shareholders will decide if senior executives\namong the private banks deserve their pay, especially after the\ngovernment\u2019s proposal to empower shareholders to block\ncompensation deals, said Tom Powdrill, a spokesman for adviser\nPensions Investment Research Consultants Ltd. in London.  \u201cThe question is, do shareholders have the same kind of\nviews on these issues as the public, as the taxpayer,\u201d he said\nby phone yesterday. \u201cIn the case of Barclays, HSBC or Standard\nChartered, decisions are mediated through asset managers, and\nreality is asset managers have quite a different view of the\nworld to the public.\u201d  The group has advised opposing the pay proposals of\nBarclays, Lloyds, HSBC and RBS for the last two years.  Labour\u2019s Gambit  RBS\u2019s Hester waived his bonus after the U.K.\u2019s opposition\n Labour Party  said it would ask Parliament to vote on the award.\nHis decision, should not be \u201cjust a one-off episode\u201d Labour\nleader  Ed Miliband  said in Glasgow,  Scotland , yesterday.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with this systematically, if we don\u2019t\ndeal with the issue of bankers\u2019 bonuses in a proper way, then\nthis sort of thing is going to reoccur,\u201d he said.  Cameron\u2019s government is trying to respond to political\npressure triggered by the bonuses bankers are being paid,\nstarting this month, at a time that voters face pay freezes and\nunemployment at a 17-year high. U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable this month outlined measures to make companies more\ntransparent about top pay and give shareholders more power to\nvote on it. Cameron also said a knighthood awarded to former RBS\nchief  Fred Goodwin  may be revoked.  Political Storm  \u201cThis will stop at the government controlled banks,\u201d said\nTom Kirchmaier, a fellow in financial-markets group at the\n London School of Economics . \u201cHowever, the political mobbing of\nHester over the last few days allowed the government-owned bank\nto renege on its own promises\u201d on bonuses. \u201cThis raises a\nnumber of questions about the governability of state-owned banks\nbank, something we should be very concerned about\u201d  Hester, 51, has been at the center of a political storm\nover executive pay since the announcement on Jan. 27 that he\nwould receive 3.6 million shares on top of his 1.2 million-pound\nsalary. The Edinburgh-based bank has risen  33 percent  this year\nto about half what the government paid for its stake.  \u201cOnly government-run banks have the ability to put\npressure on their banks to control pay,\u201d said  Jason Kennedy ,\nCEO of Kennedy Group, a London recruitment firm. \u201cIn the\nprivate sector, it\u2019s not going to happen. They provide a bonus\nstructure where if their employees get paid, so should the\nCEO.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAmbereen Choudhury in London at \n achoudhury@bloomberg.net ;\nHoward Mustoe in London at \n hmustoe@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nEdward Evans at \n eevans3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was 24.91429328918457 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of HSBC Holdings, plc. was ",
