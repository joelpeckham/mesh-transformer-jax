 "context": "The following article called 'Merkel\u2019s First Greek Crisis Visit May Mark Turning Point' was published on 2012-10-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGerman  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will\ntravel to  Athens  for the first time since  Europe \u2019s financial\ncrisis broke out there three years ago, a sign she\u2019s seeking to\nsilence the debate on pushing  Greece  out of the euro.  Merkel\u2019s visit to the Greek capital Oct. 9 to meet with\nPrime Minister Antonis Samaras underscores the shift in her\nstance since she held out the prospect last year of Greece\nexiting the 17-nation currency regime.  \u201cThe meeting could mark the turning point to the Greek\ncrisis,\u201d said Constantinos Zouzoulas, an analyst at Axia\nVentures Group, a brokerage in Athens. \u201cThis is a very\nsignificant development for Greece ahead of crucial decisions by\nthe  euro zone  for the country.\u201d  Merkel\u2019s demand for budget cuts in return for bailout\npackages has stoked public resentment, with the German\nchancellor depicted in some Greek media and on protestors\u2019\nplacards wearing jackboots and an SS uniform because of her\ninsistence on austerity. While Samaras welcomed Merkel\u2019s visit\nas a \u201cvery positive development,\u201d union walkouts and public\nprotests were immediately called to coincide with the event.  Two bailouts and the biggest debt writeoff in history have\nso far failed to halt Greece\u2019s slide into a fifth year of\nrecession, prompting  Christine Lagarde , the International\nMonetary Fund\u2019s managing director, to signal last month that\nanother writedown might have to be considered.  Help Greece  \u201cWe want to help Greece stabilize within the euro zone,\u201d\nSteffen Seibert, Merkel\u2019s chief spokesman, told reporters in\nBerlin today as he announced the trip, saying that is the main\nmessage  Germany  can give to Greece. \u201cWe do this by contributing\nmassively to the rescue programs Greece I and Greece II.\u201d  He said Merkel\u2019s trip to Athens, her first since July 2007,\nreciprocated a visit by Samaras to Berlin in August this year.\nThe full program for the trip has yet to be completed, he said,\ndescribing the visit as \u201cnormal.\u201d  Greece\u2019s ability to stabilize and stay in the euro \u201cwill\nonly be possible if Greece makes great efforts of its own,\u201d\nSeibert said. \u201cWe see that under the Samaras government there\u2019s\na strengthened reform effort and we want to support that.\u201d  Merkel has softened her tone on Greece since Samaras\u2019s\nelection earlier this year. He managed to form a coalition after\nbeating off a challenge by parties that advocated tearing up the\nterms of Greece\u2019s rescues and calling the bluff of the so-called\ntroika of international creditors -- the IMF, the  European\nCentral Bank  and European Commission -- at the risk of\ntriggering global meltdown in financial markets.  ECB, IMF  ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen said Sept. 29\nthat Greece may need more outside aid as growth fails to meet\nprojections, joining the IMF in expressing doubt two bailouts\nwill suffice. That followed Lagarde\u2019s comments that the level of\nGreek debt would have \u201cto be addressed.\u201d Thus two of the three\ntroika members have publicly called for more help for Greece.  Members of Merkel\u2019s coalition have raised options for\nGreece that include front-loading aid payments to help it over\nliquidity hurdles and lowering the  interest rate  or extending\nmaturities on loans.  A third option in the form of a second debt writedown\nfocusing on bonds held by public institutions, notably the ECB,\nwas ruled out by President  Mario Draghi  yesterday. European\npolicy makers aren\u2019t considering a rescheduling of any Greek\ndebt held by the official sector official, a European official\nsaid separately today.  Weighing Words  Merkel has yet to show her hand beyond slapping down\nlawmakers from her coalition who suggested it was time for\nGreece to quit the euro, telling them to \u201cweigh their words\nvery carefully.\u201d Germany will stand behind the Greek government\nas it strives to overhaul the economy, she said during Samaras\u2019s\nBerlin visit.  \u201cI want Greece to stay in the euro zone and that\u2019s what\nI\u2019m working for,\u201d Merkel said on Aug. 24, adding that she is\n\u201cdeeply convinced\u201d he will make every effort to solve Greece\u2019s\nproblems. The goal of austerity measures is to help Greece reach\n\u201cthe light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d  That contrasts with a threat she delivered in November\n2011, when former Prime Minister  George Papandreou  proposed a\nreferendum on austerity measures. She said the ballot,\nsubsequently rescinded, \u201cwill revolve around nothing less than\nthe question: does Greece want to stay in the euro, yes or no.\u201d  Samaras, who formed a governing coalition with two rival\nparties after winning the country\u2019s second set of elections this\nyear, is trying to convince Greece\u2019s creditors that his\ngovernment has done enough to secure its next bailout payment.  A Real Partner  \u201cThe question in German leadership circles is do we have a\nreal partner,\u201d said Alexander White, European political analyst\nat JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  London . \u201cIf they do, then they are\nin for the long term.\u201d  Samaras echoed Merkel\u2019s language on the need for a sign of\nhope for the Greek people, comparing their struggle with\neconomic hardship and political turmoil to the conditions that\nled to the collapse of the  Weimar Republic  in post-World War I\nGermany and ushered in the Nazi era.  His interview, published today in German newspaper\nHandelsblatt, came hours before Independent Greeks, the fourth-\nlargest Greek parliamentary party, called a protest outside the\nGerman Embassy in Athens during Merkel\u2019s visit to reject her\n\u201ctransforming Greece into a German protectorate.\u201d A petition to\nbe handed to the ambassador will also call for World War II\nreparations, the party said an e-mailed statement.  \u201cGreek democracy stands before what is perhaps its\ngreatest challenge,\u201d Samaras said in the interview. If his\ngovernment were to fall, \u201cchaos awaits,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people\nknow this government is Greece\u2019s last chance.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nRainer Buergin in Berlin at \n rbuergin1@bloomberg.net ;\nJames Hertling in Paris at \n jhertling@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJames Hertling at \n jhertling@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 32.49970626831055 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
