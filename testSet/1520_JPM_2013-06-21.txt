 "context": "The following article called 'Stress Test for Banks Inflicting Collateral Damage: China Credit' was published on 2013-06-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina \u2019s decision to tolerate the\nworst cash crunch on record is evolving from a stress test of\nbanks into a threat to the ability of companies to raise funds.  As their overnight borrowing  costs  neared 13 percent, banks\nswitched focus toward shoring up their own finances and slashed\ninvestments in the bond market they dominate. The one-year  yield \non AAA corporate debt jumped a record 121 basis points this\nmonth to 5.15 percent, ChinaBond indexes show. Bond sales\nslumped to 160.2 billion  yuan  ($26 billion) in June, the least\nin 17 months and down 56 percent from May, data compiled by\nBloomberg show.  China\u2019s cabinet, led by Premier Li Keqiang, said following\na June 19 meeting that finance companies must do more to support\neconomic transformation and reduce risks, after administrative\nmeasures to crack down on property and local government\ninvestment failed to halt the accumulation of debt. The timing\nof the credit squeeze has puzzled economists since official data\nshows a worsening contraction in manufacturing, easing inflation\nand a slowdown in foreign investment inflows.  \u201cThe current level of tightness in real market rates is\nexcessive and, if continued, may disrupt growth rather than make\nit more balanced,\u201d said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist in Hong\nKong at Credit Agricole CIB. \u201cBalancing growth would be\nachieved easier by boosting consumption, not by restricting\ncredit. I think they will ease monetary settings soon, via open-market operations or reserve-requirement ratio cuts.\u201d  Forecasts Lowered  The central bank has refrained from adding funds to the\nfinancial system and sold 2 billion yuan of bills yesterday to\ndrain capital, even as money market rates hit a record high. The\nWorld Bank, HSBC Holdings Plc, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG cut\n2013 gross domestic product estimates for China this month.  A report showed yesterday China\u2019s manufacturing is\nshrinking at a faster pace this month. The preliminary reading\nof 48.3 for a  Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (EC11FLAS)  released yesterday by\nHSBC Holdings and Markit Economics is below the 49.1 median\nestimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. A reading\nbelow 50 indicates contraction.  Zhu Haibin, chief economist of JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Hong\nKong, wrote in a report yesterday that there was a risk the PBOC\nmay artificially create a liquidity squeeze that would put\npressure on \u201calready weak\u201d economic activity.  Fund Flows  Yuan forwards were headed for their biggest weekly drop\nthis month after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said\nthe central bank may reduce monetary stimulus that helped spur\nfund inflows to emerging-market assets. More than $19 billion\nhas left funds investing in developing-nation assets in the\nthree weeks to June 12, the most since 2011, according to U.S.\nresearch firm EPFR Global. Foreign direct investment in China\nrose in May by the least in four months.  The one-day  repo  rate dropped 442 basis points, or 4.42\npercentage points, to 8.43 percent, after the central bank was\nsaid to have made funds available to lenders. The rate touched\nan all-time high of 12.85 percent yesterday, according to a\ndaily fixing announced by the National Interbank Funding Center\nat 11 a.m.  The  yield  on China\u2019s 10-year government bonds rose 26 basis\npoints this month to 3.70 percent yesterday, while the  rate  on\none-year debt climbed 69 basis points to 3.56 percent, ChinaBond\ndata show.  Regulators are forcing trust funds and wealth management\nplans to shift assets into publicly traded securities, taking\nso-called shadow banking funds away from property developers and\nlocal-government finance vehicles. The China Banking Regulatory\nCommission told banks in March to cap investments of client\nmoney in debt that isn\u2019t publicly traded at 35 percent of all\nfunds raised from the sale of wealth management products.  Money Supply  Shadow banking has thwarted efforts to rebalance the\neconomy. The increase in money supply exceeded the government\u2019s\n13 percent target every month this year, rising 15.8 percent in\nMay. Aggregate financing, a measure of credit that includes\ntrust loans, stock and bond sales, totaled 9.1 trillion yuan in\nthe last five months, a 52 percent jump from the first five\nmonths of 2012.  \u201cThe PBOC clearly has an agenda here,\u201d said Patrick Perret-Green, a former head of Citigroup Inc.\u2019s Asian rates and\nforeign exchange who works at Mint Partners in  London . \u201cTo fire\na massive warning shot across the banks\u2019 bows and to see who is\nswimming naked.\u201d  He added that the moves fit in well with new Chinese\nPresident Xi Jinping\u2019s disciplinarian approach. Since becoming\npresident in March, Xi has vowed to combat corruption and\npromised a \u201cthorough cleanup\u201d of the ruling Communist Party.  Shadow Banking  The central bank is trying to exert its influence over\nshadow banking activities through its executive powers as it\nwaits for tougher regulations to be put in place, said Marshall Mays, director at Emerging Alpha Advisors Ltd., which advises\nfunds on investment of about $100 million as well as regulators\non market development. Policy makers want to create a credit\nspread for corporate bonds that better assesses risk, while\nkeeping support for some state-owned enterprises, he added.  \u201cThis is a wake-up call for the SOEs,\u201d Mays said in an\ninterview from  Manila . \u201cA more cynical interpretation is that\nthe new government is starting by setting a harsh hurdle for all\nand offering those who will come to the new throne and kiss the\nnew emperor\u2019s ring a chance at a lower hurdle.\u201d  The cost of protecting China\u2019s government debt from default\nsurged 30.5 basis points to 133.6 basis points yesterday in New\nYork, according to prices from data provider CMA. The contracts\npay the buyer face value in exchange for underlying securities\nor the cash equivalent if a borrower fails to adhere to its debt\nagreements.  Waning Demand  Demand for bonds has waned in the past two weeks in the\nprimary market. The finance ministry sold 9.53 billion yuan of\n273-day bills on June 14, less than its 15 billion yuan target,\nand its 10-year auction on June 19 drew the least bids times the\namount on offer in 10 months.  Agricultural Development Bank of\nChina Co.  on June 6 raised 11.51 billion yuan in a sale of six-month bills, short of its 20 billion yuan goal.  The Export-Import Bank of China halved sale targets for a\nJune 14 auction of five- and 10-year bonds to 10 billion yuan\nfor each tenor. Agricultural Development Bank of China scaled\nback the size of a bond offering on June 18 by 31 percent.  Nomura Holdings Inc. expects a \u201cpainful deleveraging\nprocess in the next few months\u201d that may result in defaults in\nthe manufacturing and non-bank financial sectors, according to a\nreport by economists Zhiwei Zhang and Wendy Chen yesterday.\nLocal government financing vehicles and property developers are\nalso at risk, the report said.  Deceleration Signs  \u201cThe cash crunch has hit the economy,\u201d said Chen Jianheng, a bond analyst in Beijing at China International\nCapital Corp., the nation\u2019s biggest investment bank. \u201cBanks are\nextending less loans and their demand for bonds is falling. We\nmay see more signs of deceleration in economic figures next\nmonth.\u201d  Chongqing Commerce Group issued 500 million yuan of five-year AA-rated bonds at 5.43 percent last month. Quanzhou State-Owned Asset Investment Operation Co. sold 800 million yuan of\nsimilar-rated and similar-maturity debt at a yield of 5.9\npercent on June 18.  The yuan weakened 0.08 percent to 6.1328 per dollar as of\n12:26 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange\nTrade System. Non-deliverable forwards due in a year\nstrengthened 0.09 percent to 6.2995 in Hong Kong, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. The discount to the spot rate was\n2.8 percent yesterday, the deepest since February 2009.  Higher Costs  Economists forecast China\u2019s gross domestic product will\nexpand 7.6 percent in the April-June period from a year earlier,\naccording to the median estimate of 35 respondents to a\nBloomberg News survey conducted from June 14 to 19. That\ncompares with a 7.8 percent median projection in last month\u2019s\nsurvey and first-quarter growth of 7.7 percent.  \u201cIf the liquidity squeeze worsens and the interbank rate\nstays at such high levels for longer than expected, that will\nlead to higher borrowing costs for companies,\u201d said Tang Jianwei, a Shanghai-based economist at Bank of Communications\nCo., the nation\u2019s fifth-biggest lender. \u201cIt will be devastating\nto an economy that\u2019s already struggling,\u201d  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:\nJudy Chen in Shanghai at \n xchen45@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJames Regan at \n jregan19@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 41.32088088989258 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
