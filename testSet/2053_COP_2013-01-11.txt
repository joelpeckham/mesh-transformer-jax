(883) ,  China \u2019s biggest offshore\noil and gas producer, received an initial approval to restart\nits largest offshore oilfield, which was shut in 2011 after an\noil leak.  The National Development and Reform Commission, the\ncountry\u2019s economic planner, approved the development plan for\nPenglai 19-3 in December, the National Energy Administration\nsaid in a statement today on its website.  Cnooc was ordered to shut the Penglai field in September\n2011 after drilling activity leaked at least 3,200 barrels of\noil and fluids into North China\u2019s Bohai Bay. Cnooc and its\npartner  ConocoPhillips (COP)  have since cleaned up the spill and\nagreed to pay about $160 million in compensation to Chinese\nfishermen for losses.  \u201cWe still have to go through other regulatory approvals\nand meet requirements before the site can resume production,\u201d a\nBeijing-based spokeswoman at Cnooc said in an e-mail.  The State Oceanic Administration ordered closing the\nPenglai site. An approval from the agency is needed to restart\nproduction, Cnooc Chief Executive Officer Li Fanrong said in\nAugust.  Cnooc shares fell 1.9 percent to HK$16.22 at the close in\n Hong Kong . The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  declined 0.4 percent.  Penglai 19-3 produced 62,000 barrels of oil a day before it\nwas closed. The lost production was equivalent to about 7\npercent of Cnooc\u2019s targeted daily oil and gas production,\naccording to calculations by Bloomberg.  Quick Start  Cnooc\u2019s total net production rose 9 percent to 87.8 million\nbarrels of oil equivalent in the third quarter last year because\nof higher overseas output and stable production from domestic\nwells other than Penglai 19-3, the company said on Oct. 25.  Chairman Wang Yilin said in May the company was \u201cready\u201d\nto resume operations in Penglai, pending government approvals.  \u201cProduction at its full capacity could be achieved within\nsix months of the restart,\u201d said Shi Yan, an analyst at UOB-Kay\nHian Ltd. in  Shanghai .  Cnooc received approval from the Canadian government for a\n$15.1 billion acquisition of  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , the biggest takeover by\na Chinese company, in December. Cnooc said it expects to close\nthe deal in the first quarter.
