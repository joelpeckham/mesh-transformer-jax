 "context": "The following article called 'Insurers Face Jumbled Market With Health Exchange Rules' was published on 2012-12-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the biggest\nU.S. health insurer, will face a fragmented regulatory landscape\nin 2014 under the first state insurance marketplaces approved as\npart of the health-care overhaul.  Rules for the six state insurance exchanges that won\nconditional approval from the Obama administration Dec. 10 are\nsplit evenly between those with strict criteria for companies\nthat want to participate and states that have opened their\nexchanges to all comers, a scenario supported by the insurance\nindustry. A high bar for inclusion could limit the number of\ninsurers offering health plans in some states.  The exchanges, the heart of the 2010 Affordable Care Act\u2019s\nplan to expand health care to 30 million people, have less than\na year to open online platforms where local residents, with the\nhelp of federal tax credits, can shop online for insurance. The\napproved states are Connecticut,  Maryland ,  Colorado ,  Oregon ,\n Massachusetts  and  Washington , all led by Democratic governors.  \u201cThe challenge is it\u2019s all new,\u201d said Kim Holland,\n executive director  for state affairs at the Blue Cross Blue\nShield Association, a Washington-based trade group that\nrepresents 38 state insurance plans. \u201cWe have a really, really\nshort period of time in order to get everything done.\u201d  Enrollment in the exchanges must begin by Oct. 1 for plans\nthat will take effect Jan. 1, 2014. The U.S. government plans to\ngive states that run their own exchanges a share of about $2\nbillion to help get them started.  In  Connecticut , regulators are taking a strict approach by\nmaking insurers meet requirements for patient access to doctors\nthat exceed those of the federal Affordable Care Act. Insurers\nwill have to make two-year commitments to participate in the\n Connecticut  Health Insurance Exchange, and include almost all of\nthe state\u2019s U.S.-funded health clinics in their networks.  \u2018Passionate Role\u2019  \u201cThe board saw its role as being very, I\u2019d say, passionate\nabout supporting consumers and trying to establish standards\nwhere health plans could reach to a slightly higher bar than\nrequired in the ACA,\u201d said Kevin Counihan, chief executive\nofficer of the Connecticut exchange.  At the same time, Maryland said it\u2019s letting any plan that\nmeets federal standards sell coverage at the start as the state\nrushes to craft a marketplace that will be popular with both\nconsumers and insurers.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on in the initial couple of years is\nreally getting as many people enrolled on the exchange as\npossible,\u201d Rebecca Pearce, executive director of the  Maryland\nHealth Benefit Exchange , said in a phone interview. \u201cTo do that\nwe need to make sure we have as many carriers as possible.\u201d  \u2018Unlevel Field\u2019  Insurers are worried about measures that might create \u201can\nunlevel playing field,\u201d according to Holland, a former Oklahoma\ninsurance commissioner, speaking in a telephone interview.\n\u201cAnything that would create market variation or lack of\nconsistency would be problematic.\u201d  Daryl Richard, a UnitedHealth spokesman, said the\nMinnetonka, Minnesota-based company is in the process of\nresearching how each of the state\u2019s exchanges may be structured.  \u201cGiven the regulatory variation from state to state -- and\nmany states have not yet formalized their exchange models -- we\nhave not yet made any decisions about where we will be offering\nour health plans through the exchanges,\u201d Richard said.  UnitedHealth is not the only for-profit insurer looking at\nthe exchanges warily, said  Robert Zirkelbach , a spokesman for\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s lobbying group\nin Washington.  The group has generally opposed practices like those of\nConnecticut, a model called \u201cactive purchasing\u201d through which\nsome insurers may be excluded from selling their plans, he said.  Maximizing Choice  \u201cThere\u2019s already variation in how health insurance is\nregulated state by state,\u201d Zirkelbach said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cThe important thing is how the exchanges are\nstructured, ensuring they\u2019re done in a way that will maximize\nchoice and competition for consumers and employers.\u201d  States with extra rules run the risk that insurers won\u2019t\nparticipate in their exchanges, said  Ana Gupte , an analyst with\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co. in  New York .  \u201cI\u2019m sure the  insurance industry  will go in with good\nfaith of wanting to play everywhere they possibly can, but they\ncan always reduce their effort and involvement over time,\u201d she\nsaid in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance, because you do want\nthe large publicly traded players and the big Blue Cross Blue\nShield to of course all be there, in addition to the smaller\nnot-for-profits.\u201d  December Deadline  A majority of the remaining 50 U.S. states may let the U.S.\nrun the markets or choose to provide services such as consumer\nassistance in a partnership with the federal government.  Twenty-two governors, all Republicans, have already sent\nnotice that they won\u2019t build their own exchanges. The rest have\nuntil Dec. 14 to decide.  No more than three or four additional states are expected\nto build exchanges themselves, according to estimates made by\nBryce Williams, a managing director at the consulting company\nTowers Watson, in a phone interview last week.  Nationwide, health plans will be required to meet certain\nminimum qualifications for participating in the exchanges, such\nas offering sufficient networks of doctors and hospitals and\nmeeting federal limits on out-of-pocket costs. The law lets\nstates set additional rules.  Being Selective  In states that already have many competing health plans,\n\u201cthe exchange can afford to be a little more selective, versus\na state where there aren\u2019t that many health plans, or the\npolitics are such that they don\u2019t believe in as active a state\nrole,\u201d said Jon Kingsdale, a former executive director at the\nMassachusetts\u2019 health exchange and a managing director at Wakely\nConsulting Group, an adviser for five of the six states that won\napproval.  Maryland may establish stricter rules aimed at driving down\nhealth-care costs, \u201cat the point we have the market behind\nus,\u201d Pearce said. The state\u2019s marketplace has already drawn\ninterest from 10 companies, including UnitedHealth and  Aetna\nInc. (AET) , and will be open to any plan that meets the federal\nminimum rules, with a few technical modifications, until at\nleast 2016, she said.  Connecticut will require all health plans to commit to sell\nplans in its exchange for at least two years, and they face a\ntwo-year \u201clockout\u201d period if they exit the exchange, said\nCounihan, the CEO of the state\u2019s exchange. Plans will also have\nto include at least 90 percent of the state\u2019s federally funded\nhealth clinics in their networks, a rule aimed at protecting\nlow-income people, he said in an interview.  Massachusetts\u2019s Health Connector, the exchange that has\noperated in that state since 2006, has added carriers even as it\nimposed rules that include requiring insurers to offer standard\nbenefit packages, said Glen Shor, the executive director.  \u201cWe work very closely with all of our insurers to\nstructure rules that empower consumers but make it as easy as\npossible for insurers to work with us,\u201d he said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cIt is a delicate balance to strike.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAlex Wayne in Washington at \n awayne3@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nReg Gale at \n rgale5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated was 47.349082946777344 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated was ",
