The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe euro climbed to $1.31 for the\nfirst time in almost three months as European confidence in the\neconomic outlook rose to the highest level in more than two\nyears this month and German unemployment decreased.  \n The Swiss franc advanced to a six-month high against the\ndollar on speculation the central bank was selling some of its\n$208 billion in reserves, which almost tripled during the past\nyear as the national bank tried to weaken the currency.  \n \u201cWe\u2019re in a bearish dollar supply mode and bullish for the\neuro,\u201d said  Win Thin , a senior currency strategist at Brown\nBrothers Harriman & Co. in New York. \u201cThe optimism is there.\nPeople are buying the euro on dips.\u201d  \n The euro appreciated 0.6 percent to $1.3078 at 4:01 p.m. in\nNew York, from $1.2995 yesterday, after reaching $1.3107, the\nhighest level since May 4. The euro traded at 113.63 yen,\ncompared with 113.66. The yen strengthened 0.8 percent to 86.82\nagainst the dollar, from 87.47.  \n Europe\u2019s shared currency was headed for a 7 percent monthly\nrally against the dollar and a 5.3 percent gain versus the yen\non the region\u2019s economic prospects.  \n An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the euro\nnations increased this month to 101.3, the highest level since\nMarch 2008, the European Commission said. The number of people\nout of work in Germany fell in July for a 13th month, dropping\nby a seasonally adjusted 20,000 to 3.21 million, the lowest\nlevel since November 2008, the Federal Labor Agency reported.  \n Stress Tests  \n The euro was also supported this week as stress tests\nreleased July 23 found only seven European banks needed to raise\nadditional capital.  \n The Federal Reserve underscored yesterday in the Beige Book\nbusiness survey its view that the U.S. economic recovery, while\nstill moving forward, is progressing at a slower pace than\nearlier in the year.  \n U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 2.5 percent\nannualized rate in the second quarter after expanding at a 2.7\npercent pace in the first three months of the year, according to\nthe median forecast of 81 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.\nThe report from the Commerce Department is due tomorrow.  \n \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re going to see continued\nstrength in the euro-zone data and continued weakness in U.S.\ndata,\u201d said  Kathy Lien , director of currency research at the\nonline trader GFT Forex, in New York. \u201cThe rallies are\ncautious. We\u2019re not seeing really aggressive moves across the\nboard.\u201d  \n Outlook for Euro  \n The euro\u2019s 10 percent rally from a four-year low of $1.1877\nreached June 7 will probably stall as economic weakness in\nEurope outside Germany saps demand for the 16-nation currency,\naccording to  Rebecca Patterson  of JPMorgan Chase & Co.  \n The shared currency may peak after reaching at least\n$1.3125, the next level of technical resistance, said Patterson,\nglobal head of foreign exchange at the private banking unit of\nJPMorgan in New York, in a radio interview today on \u201cBloomberg\nSurveillance\u201d with  Tom Keene .  \n \u201cGermany is the only element of strength here,\u201d Patterson\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s Germany versus the rest of Europe. And I think with\nthat backdrop, it\u2019s hard to see all of this continuing very\nfar.\u201d Resistance is a level where sell orders may be clustered.  \n The Swiss franc climbed against all of its most-traded\ncounterparts on speculation the central bank is selling\nreserves.  \n The currency appreciated as much as 1.9 percent to 1.0374\nversus the dollar, the strongest level since Jan. 25. The franc\ngained as much as 1.1 percent to 1.3582 against the euro.\nStandard Bank Plc advised buying the franc against the dollar,\npredicting a rally to 1.0150.  \n Weaker Kiwi  \n New Zealand\u2019s dollar fell for a third day versus the\ngreenback after the central bank said deteriorating growth will\nslow the pace of future interest-rate increases.  \n Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor  Alan Bollard  raised\nthe official cash rate for a second month, increasing it by a\nquarter-percentage point to 3 percent.  \n New Zealand\u2019s dollar dropped 0.4 percent to 72.41 U.S.\ncents, from 72.73.
