 "context": "The following article called 'Mongolia Minerals Law Threatens Coal Project, Group Says' was published on 2013-01-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nProposed changes to Mongolia\u2019s mining\nlaws threaten the viability of the nation\u2019s biggest coal project\nat Tavan Tolgoi and will further deter foreign investment, the\n Business Council of Mongolia  said.  The legislation, which will give the state the right to a\nfree stake in many mineral projects, will take the country away\nfrom the free-market principles practiced there since the early\n1990s, Mongolia\u2019s largest business group said in a four-page\nletter sent to President Tsakhia Elbegdorj\u2019s office on Jan. 7.\nThe letter, made public by e-mail yesterday, came after the\ndraft laws were published last month.  Overseas investment in Mongolia, which relies on minerals\nfor more than 90 percent of its exports, has cooled since a law\nlast year restricted state owned companies from controlling\nstrategic assets. Lawmakers have also unsuccessfully sought\ntwice in the past 18 months to renegotiate the development\naccord for  Rio Tinto  Group\u2019s Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine,\nwhich will account for about 30 percent of the nation\u2019s gross\ndomestic product once in full production, in a bid to take a\ngreater share for the state.  \u201cThe draft minerals law will hurt all investment in mining\nin Mongolia, local as well as foreign,\u201d Jim Dwyer, the\nexecutive director of the business group, said in an e-mail.\n\u201cThis would include the government\u2019s huge Tavan Tolgoi coal\nproject and Mongolia\u2019s largest publicly-owned mine, Energy\nResources.\u201d  The proposed law specifies output targets and obliges mine\noperators to follow them regardless of market demand, which\nwould affect prices and profits of projects, said Dale Choi, an\n Ulan Bator  based associate with Origo Partners MGL, a private\nequity investment firm.  State Control  The effect will be to make mining projects aligned with the\ninterests of the state, said Choi, a committee member at the\ngroup. In addition, the law would allow settlements as small as\na village to decide on whether to accept prospecting and\nexploration on land near them or not, he said.  \u201cNobody expected that the law would be so tough on\nmining,\u201d Choi said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way this is not correlated\nwith the presidential elections this year. The majority of the\npopulation may favor this law, because it is not happy with\nmining, especially in the rural areas. The country as a whole\nbenefits from mining, but locals feel they don\u2019t directly\nbenefit.\u201d  Rio Tinto  Investments by Rio Tinto and its  Turquoise Hill Resources\nLtd. (TRQ)  and  SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ)  units helped fuel Mongolia\u2019s\nrecord economic expansion of 17 percent in 2011. That slowed\nafter Mongolia passed the Strategic Entities Foreign Investment\nLaw, which effectively blocked state-owned Aluminum Corp. of\n China  Ltd. from taking control of SouthGobi.  \u201cIt is unlikely that the exploitation of Tavan Tolgoi will\nbe an economically viable or commercially attractive if it will\nbe regulated by the Draft Law,\u201d the business group said in the\nletter.  Mongolia has delayed picking a foreign partner to develop\nthe West Tsankhi area of the 6-billion-metric-ton Tavan Tolgoi\ncoal deposit for more than two years as it seeks to balance\ndomestic interests with those of investors from the U.S.,\n Russia , China,  Japan  and  South Korea . Companies that have sought\nto be involved include  Peabody Energy (BTU)  Corp., OAO Russian\nRailways, and China\u2019s  Shenhua Group .  Property, Banking  The negative impact from the draft law could spread to real\nestate and commercial banking among other sectors in the mining\nindustry supply chain, Dwyer said. The law may allow for the\ncreation of a \u201ca few Mongolian oligarchs,\u201d he said.  The Business Council of Mongolia, founded in 2007, has 250\nmembers including Rio Tinto, Peabody Energy,  General Electric\nCo. (GE)  and Mitsubishi Corp. The Office of the President of Mongolia\ndidn\u2019t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment\nyesterday.  The current minerals law was passed in 2006 and is the\nbasis for the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement between Rio Tinto,\nthe owner of 66 percent of the project and Mongolia, which has\nthe rest, according to Mongolia International Capital Corp., an\nUlan Bator-based investment bank. The proposed law is twice as\nlong as the current legislation, MICC said in a report last\nmonth.  Oil, Water  The draft law defines water, oil, gas, radioactive minerals\nand rare earth elements as of strategic importance, according to\nan English translation of it provided by the business group. The\nborders of strategic deposits will be defined by the Central\nState Administration.  Investors in strategic deposits will need to establish an\naccord with the government and set up a \u201cspecial regime\u201d for\nmining such minerals, according to the translation of the\ndocuments. Mongolia will take a stake in the company developing\na strategic deposits free of charge, the draft says, adding that\nthe percentage will be specified in each accord.  The draft proposes that Mongolia does not add new deposits\nto the strategic list apart from those already on it. There are\n15 deposits on the strategic list, new agency news.mn reported\nlast month.  The proposed legislation would need to be passed by\nMongolia\u2019s parliament for it to become law. Chimed Saikhanbileg,\ncabinet secretary, said the proposed law was drafted by the\npresident\u2019s office and declined further comment.  Mongolia\u2019s economy grew 13.2 percent in the first half of\n2012, according to the national statistics office. Expansion for\nthe full year may have slowed to 11 percent, central bank\ngovernor Naidansuren Zoljargal said in October. The government\nhas yet to release annual economic statistics.  The country, which had parliamentary elections last year,\nis due to vote on a new president in June.
