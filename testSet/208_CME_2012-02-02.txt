The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIntercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) , the\nsecond-largest U.S. futures market, said U.S. West Texas\nIntermediate crude oil futures volume fell 52 percent in\nJanuary, compared with a year ago.  Average daily volume of WTI contracts, the grade of oil\nthat sets wholesale prices in the U.S., was 157,027 last month,\ndown from 326,694 a year ago, the Atlanta-based company said in\na statement today. Intercontinental\u2019s ICE Futures Europe\nexchange offers trading in WTI and Brent crude oil, the grade\nthat sets wholesale prices worldwide.  \u201cThe fall in volume is indicative of less money flowing\ninto the market,\u201d said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork\nGroup, a consulting company in Villanova, Pennsylvania. \u201cA lot\nof the funds had a very poor year.\u201d  Claire Miller, an Intercontinental spokeswoman in London,\ndeclined to comment.

(CME) , the\nworld\u2019s largest futures marketplace, saw January WTI volume fall\n30 percent compared to last year, said Damon Leavell, a\nspokesman.

Open interest, or the amount of active\nWTI contracts, was up this year, which typically means volumes\nwill increase, he said.  Total volume at ICE Futures Europe fell 5.4 percent last\nmonth, compared with a year earlier. At the three futures\nexchanges owned by Intercontinental, average volume dropped 5.7\npercent, it said in the statement.
