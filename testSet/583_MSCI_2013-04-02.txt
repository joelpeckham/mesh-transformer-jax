 "context": "The following article called 'Russian Economy Slows to Weakest Growth Since 2009 Slump' was published on 2013-04-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRussia\u2019s economy  grew at the weakest\npace in the fourth quarter since a recession in 2009 as  Europe \u2019s\ndebt crisis prompted companies to cut investment and the\ngovernment curbed a year-end spending splurge.  Gross domestic product rose 2.1 percent from a year\nearlier, slowing from an upwardly revised 3 percent in the third\nquarter, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said in an e-\nmailed statement today. That matched the median estimate of 18\nanalysts in a Bloomberg  survey .  Consumer demand is waning just as a recession in the\nEuropean Union, which accounts for about half of Russian trade,\nchokes corporate investment and curbs demand for commodities,\nhurting sales at companies from OAO Novolipetsk Steel to\ncarmaker OAO AvtoVAZ. The slowdown, which has continued into\nthis year, sparked an argument between policy makers over\ninterest-rate cuts to spur growth with inflation above target.  \u201cOur economic growth of less than 3 percent is stagnation,\nputting us behind the global economy,\u201d former Finance Minister\n Alexei Kudrin  said at a conference in Moscow today. \u201cWe\u2019ll have\nto fight for 3 percent. And every month so far this year has\nedged us toward cutting the growth forecast.\u201d  The statistics service reiterated its first estimate of\neconomic growth at 3.4 percent for 2012, down from 4.3 percent\nin 2011 and 4.5 percent in 2010. Second-quarter growth was\nrevised up to 4.3 percent and the January-March period was cut\nto 4.8 percent, according to the statement.  Lagging Behind  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 50-stocks advanced 1.1 percent in the\nfinal quarter of last year, lagging behind a 5.2 percent gain in\nthe MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index. The Russian benchmark reversed\ngains after the central bank reduced some  interest rates  today\nto trade 0.1 percent lower at 1,427.68 as of 3:27 p.m. in\nMoscow.  Steelmakers including  Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK)  and  OAO Severstal (SVST) \nreported net losses in the fourth quarter. Billionaire Alexey Mordashov, Severstal\u2019s chief executive, cited a weakening global\neconomy as a drag on demand.  There\u2019s \u201cvirtually no chance\u201d the economy will expand\nfaster than the government\u2019s official 3.6 percent forecast for\nthis year and risks persist that it will grow more slowly,\nDeputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said at a conference\norganized by the Vedomosti newspaper March 29.  The Economy Ministry may revise the growth forecast, Deputy\nEconomy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said at the same conference,\ndeclining to elaborate. Russia would grow less than 2 percent in\n2013 if output continued to expand at the current pace, he said.  Growing at the 5 percent medium-term target set by Prime\nMinister  Dmitry Medvedev  isn\u2019t in the cards for this year, and\nprobably won\u2019t happen in the coming years without a significant\nimprovement in the external environment, according to Klepach.
