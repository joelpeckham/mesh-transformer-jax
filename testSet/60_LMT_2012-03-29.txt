 "context": "The following article called 'Lockheed F-35 Aircraft Costs Rise About 4.3%, Pentagon Says' was published on 2012-03-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe cost to develop and buy 2,443\n Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  F-35 fighters with engines from  United\nTechnologies Corp. (UTX)  has increased about 4.3 percent since 2010,\naccording to new Pentagon figures.  The production and acquisition costs have risen to $395.6\nbillion from $379.3 billion, according to the Pentagon\u2019s\nSelected Acquisition Report delivered to Congress today.  The 4.3 percent increase is \u201cnot bad, but on a program of\nthis size even a small percentage increase translates into\nserious dollars,\u201d Jeremiah Gertler, a military aircraft analyst\nfor the non-partisan  Congressional Research Service , said in an\ne-mailed statement.  The Pentagon estimated the cost to maintain and support\n2,443 of the F-35s worldwide, including fuel, pilot training,\nand maintenance, rose to $1.1 trillion from $1 trillion, last\nyear\u2019s estimate.  The 4.3 percent increase on the F-35, the Pentagon\u2019s\nlargest and most scrutinized program, is in keeping with a 5\npercent cost increase for major weapons reported today by the\nU.S. Government Accountability Office.  The Pentagon\u2019s independent cost assessment office in June\n2010 pegged the F-35s total program acquisition cost in\ninflation-adjusted \u201cthen-year\u201d dollars at $382 billion.  \u2018Finding Design Issues\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019re still about 20 percent of the way through the test\nprogram\u201d on the F-35, Frank Kendall, the Pentagon\u2019s acting\nundersecretary for acquisition, told the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee today. \u201cWe are finding design issues, as we go\nthrough the test program, that we have to correct.\u201d  \u201cSo there are some cost adjustments associated with\nthat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do think that the strike fighter is\ngetting under control.\u201d  The Pentagon report said the  Air Force , Navy and Marines\nhave asked to delay declaring when they plan to deem the first\nF-35 squadrons ready for combat.  \u201cThey are pleased with the progress they have witnessed\nover the past year but wish to observe additional results during\n2012,\u201d according to the report.  The program\u2019s original goals, set in late 2001, anticipated\nthe Marines declaring an operational capability this December\nand the Air Force and Navy in April 2016.  Now \u201cthe program anticipates the services will identify\ntheir initial operational capabilities in 2013,\u201d according to\nthe report.  Inflation, Delays  The cost for the F-35\u2019s airframe increased $10.6 billion to\n$331 billion \u201cdue primarily to the application of revised\u201d\ninflation escalation indexes and the effect of delaying aircraft\npurchases three consecutive years, the Pentagon said.  The Air Force and Navy have each extended by two years the\ncompletion of their program purchases -- the Air Force to 2037\nand the Navy to 2029, the Pentagon said.  Contractor labor hours that were greater than estimated\nadded $4 million, and slower-than-expected international sales\nadded $832.6 million, according to the Pentagon.  Engine costs increased mostly because of an increase of\nabout $4 billion in estimates for spare parts. Revised inflation\nestimates added $705 million, the Pentagon said.  The Pentagon report said the Pentagon planned to buy 62\naircraft in 2014, 44 in 2015, 66 in 2016 and 76 in 2017 -- down\n33, 37, 42 and 54 planes from last year\u2019s plan.
