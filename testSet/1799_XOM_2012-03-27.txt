 "context": "The following article called 'Kurds May Halt Crude Exports If Iraq Withholds $1.5 Billion' was published on 2012-03-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCrude exports from  Iraq \u2019s semi-\nautonomous Kurdish region dropped to 50,000 barrels a day and\nmay cease in a month if the central government refuses to pay\nabout $1.5 billion owed to producers, Kurdish authorities said.  The Kurdistan Regional Government also called today on\nforeign companies including  BP Plc (BP/)  not to make separate\nagreements with Iraq\u2019s central government to develop  oil fields \nin and around the disputed northern city of Kirkuk. The central\ngovernment has said it is talking with BP about boosting output\nat a field called Kirkuk, near the same city.  A dispute over oil revenues between Iraq\u2019s government and\nKurdish authorities led to a yearlong halt in exports from the\nregion that ended in February 2011. Iraq holds the world\u2019s\nfifth-biggest crude reserves, based on BP statistics that also\ninclude Canadian  oil sands , and it seeks to boost oil exports to\nhelp rebuild an economy recovering after years of conflict,\nsanctions and sabotage.  \u201cThis latest chapter in the protracted struggle between\nthe central and regional government puts something of a downer\non the realization of Iraq\u2019s vast crude export potential,\u201d JBC\nEnergy GmbH, a Vienna-based consultant founded by Managing\nDirector  Johannes Benigni , said in a note today.  Kurdish Potential  The Kurdish Ministry of Natural Resources cut its oil\nexports from 175,000 barrels a day \u201cbecause of the production\ncosts and the re-investments needed by the producing companies\nin the region,\u201d according to a statement on the official KRG\nwebsite. The Kurds are targeting 175,000 barrels a day, as\nspecified in the Iraqi federal budget, and could export\n\u201csignificantly more\u201d if the central government in Baghdad\nfulfills commitments to pay companies pumping crude at Kurdish\nfields, the KRG said.  The Kurds export crude through a pipeline controlled by the\ncentral government, which paid producers in the Kurdish region a\ntotal of $514 million last year, according to the statement.  \u201cWe still remain hopeful that the authorities in  Baghdad \nwill realize the damage being caused to Iraq\u2019s economy by their\ncontinued failure to comply with their commitments,\u201d the KRG\nsaid.  The Iraqi Finance Ministry has allocated 650 billion dinars\n($558 million) in the government\u2019s annual budget for payments to\nforeign companies working in the Kurdish region, and it will\nrelease the funds upon completion of an official audit, Finance\nMinister Rafih Al-Issawi said.  Halt Not Feared  \u201cWe do not fear the halt of crude exports from the\nKurdistan Regional Government,\u201d he told reporters in Baghdad\ntoday, without elaborating.  BP is in talks aimed at raising production at the Kirkuk\nfield by 300,000 barrels a day, more than double the deposit\u2019s\ncurrent output, Hussain Gholam, the deputy director general of\nIraq\u2019s North Oil Co., said in a March 22 interview.  The Kurdish ministry, in a separate statement on the KRG\nwebsite, said the central government doesn\u2019t have exclusive\nauthority over Kirkuk or any other oil field. Developing the\nnation\u2019s energy deposits requires the approval of regional\ngovernments, the KRG said.  The central government refuses to do business with\ncompanies working in the Kurdish region. It said on March 22\nthat  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  had agreed to freeze business the company\nhad arranged with the Kurds.  Iraq produced 2.76 million barrels a day of crude in\nFebruary, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Most of the\noutput comes from southern fields. The central government, which\nexpects to pump 3.4 million barrels a day by the end of the\nyear, has awarded 15 energy licenses since the 2003 U.S.-led\ninvasion that ousted former President  Saddam Hussein . It plans a\nnew licensing round in May.
