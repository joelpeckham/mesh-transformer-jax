The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe CEE Stock Exchange Group, which\nincludes bourses in Vienna, Budapest,  Prague  and Ljubljana, said\nit\u2019s open to holding \u201cmerger of equals\u201d talks with the  Warsaw\nStock Exchange (GPW) , its biggest rival.  \u201cWe would be open to doing something with Warsaw though\nthey see us a competitor,\u201d Michael Buhl, the Vienna bourse\u2019s\nco-chief executive officer said in an interview in London. \u201cWe\nwould be interested in a stronger cooperation up to a possible\nmerger. A merger of equals ultimately would make sense,\u201d he\nadded.  The two exchanges are vying for influence in the region.\nAustria\u2019s Wiener Boerse AG in 2008 bought stakes in exchanges in\nLjubljana, Budapest and Prague and the bourses will eventually\nall run on the same trading system, supplied by  Deutsche Boerse\nAG. (DB1)  The Warsaw exchange, which listed its stock in 2010,\ndominates listings in the region.  \u201cThey won\u2019t be complete without us and we won\u2019t be\ncomplete without them,\u201d Buhl said. \u201cIt makes sense, there are\na lot of synergies. Together we really would be central and\neastern Europe. But it remains wishful thinking for the time\nbeing.\u201d  There are at present \u201cno concrete talks, unfortunately,\u201d\nhe said.  Last year, in a populist outcry, antitrust concern and\n volatile markets  prevented the completion of more than $37\nbillion in announced transactions, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg on deals valued at $1 billion or more.  European Union regulators on Feb. 1 vetoed Deutsche Boerse\nAG and  NYSE Euronext\u2019s (NYX)  plan to create the world\u2019s biggest\nexchange after concluding the merger would hurt competition.\n Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) \nabandoned an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext after the U.S.\nJustice Department threatened to sue. London Stock Exchange\nGroup Plc\u2019s effort to take over Canada\u2019s TMX Group Inc was\nthwarted and  Singapore Exchange Ltd.\u2019s (SGX)  $8.8 billion bid for ASX\nLtd. collapsed after Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said the\ndeal wasn\u2019t in the national interest.
