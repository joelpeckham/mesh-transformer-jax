 "context": "The following article called 'Morgan Keegan Loses Ruling in Auction-Rate Appeals Case' was published on 2012-05-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission lawsuit alleging Morgan Keegan & Co. brokers misled\ninvestors about the liquidity risk of auction-rate securities\nwas reinstated by a federal appeals court.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Atlanta said today that a\ntrial judge had incorrectly agreed with Morgan Keegan that\nbrokers\u2019 verbal comments to four customers weren\u2019t \u201cmaterial\u201d\nmisrepresentations or omissions that would make the company\nliable under U.S. securities law.  \u201cMorgan Keegan argues that the materiality of a\nmisrepresentation in an SEC enforcement action is evaluated in\nthe context of only disclosures to the public as a whole and\nwithout any consideration of a broker\u2019s communications to a\nparticular investor,\u201d the appellate panel said.  \u201cThis argument fails because the Supreme Court\u2019s\nmateriality standard analyzes the total mix of information\navailable to a hypothetical reasonable investor, not just to the\npublic at large,\u201d the panel said in the ruling.  The SEC sued  Memphis , Tennessee-based Morgan Keegan in\n2009, accusing it of  securities fraud . The SEC said Morgan\nKeegan brokers, from late 2007 through the collapse of the\nmarket of auction-rate securities in February 2008, told\ncustomers the securities \u201cwere as good as cash\u201d because they\nwanted to increase sales.  Market Collapse  The market for the securities collapsed when dealers\nstopped participating in auctions at which  interest rates  were\nperiodically reset. The investments typically were municipal and\nstudent-loan-backed bonds and preferred shares.  U.S. District Judge William Duffey in Atlanta last year\nthrew out the SEC claim that the firm didn\u2019t provide heightened\ndisclosure that auction-rate securities were regularly failing.\nMorgan Keegan\u2019s \u201cfailure to predict the market does not\nconstitute securities fraud,\u201d the judge said.  Raymond James Financial Inc. (RJF)  last month completed a\n$1.2 billion acquisition of Morgan Keegan from  Regions Financial\nCorp. (RF)  Representatives of St. Petersburg, Florida-based Raymond\nJames didn\u2019t immediately return a call after regular business\nhours seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is SEC v. Morgan Keegan & Co. Inc., 11-13992, U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (Atlanta).
