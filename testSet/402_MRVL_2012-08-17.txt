 "context": "The following article called '\u2018Moles\u2019 Gave Hedge-Fund Manager Whitman Tips, U.S. Says' was published on 2012-08-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWhitman Capital LLC\u2019s Doug Whitman\nused illegal tips from company \u201cmoles\u201d to make trades on\n Polycom Inc. (PLCM) ,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) , a\nprosecutor told jurors at the end of the hedge-fund manager\u2019s\ncriminal trial.  \u201cMr. Whitman absolutely knew what was allowed and what was\nnot allowed, despite the story they spun up there on the witness\nstand,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Jillian Berman said in her\nclosing argument today in  Manhattan  federal court.  Whitman, 54, is the first defendant in the government\u2019s\ncrackdown on hedge-fund insider trading to testify at trial,\nspending more than two days on the stand. Jurors also heard\ntestimony from three witnesses who pleaded guilty to passing\nillegal tips and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.  Whitman is charged with two counts of conspiracy and two\ncounts of  securities fraud . The securities-fraud charges carry a\nmaximum 20-year sentence. The possible sentence on the\nconspiracy counts is five years. Jurors deliberated for about an\nhour today without reaching a verdict. They will continue\nconsidering the case next week.  Convicted insider-trading defendants sentenced in the\nManhattan federal courthouse since the start of 2011 have been\nsentenced to an average of about 22 months in prison, according\nto a Bloomberg analysis of court records. Seven defendants who\nwere convicted at trial, rather than pleading guilty, got an\naverage of 58 months in prison.  Three Witnesses  Berman urged jurors to convict Whitman based on the\ntestimony of the government\u2019s witnesses along with trading\nrecords, recorded phone calls, instant messages and other\nevidence. During the trial, the jurors heard testimony from\n Roomy Khan , Karl Motey and Wesley Wang, who said they passed\ninside information to Whitman. All three have pleaded guilty and\nare cooperating with the government in hopes of receiving\nlighter sentences.  David Anderson , Whitman\u2019s lawyer, attacked the three in his\nclosing argument, particularly Khan, a former neighbor of\nWhitman\u2019s in Atherton,  California  who admitted in her testimony\nshe had \u201clied a number of times\u201d to government investigators\nand others.  \u201cThe fact that Roomy Khan says something doesn\u2019t mean a\nthing,\u201d Anderson argued. \u201cRoomy Khan has lost her relationship\nwith the truth so long ago.\u201d  Consultant Testimony  Anderson also urged the 12 jurors and three alternates to\ndisregard the testimony of Motey, a consultant hired by Whitman,\nand Wang, a consultant who worked for Trellus Management and\nSigma Capital, a division of SAC Capital Advisors LP.  Berman said that Khan gave Whitman detailed earnings\ninformation for Google in 2007, which she got from a woman at an\noutside investor-relations firm that was working with the\n Mountain View , California-based search engine company. Whitman\nallegedly used the information, that Google would miss analysts\u2019\nearnings expectations, to buy put options on the company\u2019s\nstock. He made about $590,000 in less than 24 hours, after\nGoogle disclosed its quarterly financial results to the public,\naccording to Berman.  The next day, Whitman sent a $125 bouquet of flowers to\nKhan with a note reading \u201cthank you from whitman capital.\u201d  Whitman claimed he sent the flowers because Khan, who also\nmade money shorting Google shares, had been unhappy beforehand.  \u2018Nice Thing\u2019  \u201cI just thought it would be a nice thing to do,\u201d Whitman\ntestified.  Whitman also traded on Polycom earnings information from\nKhan and on Marvell tips that Motey passed him from two company\nexecutives, Berman said. Whitman made more than $900,000 for his\nfund from illegal trades, according to the government.  Anderson argued that Whitman is innocent because he had a\ngood-faith belief he wasn\u2019t trading on improper information.  Anderson said Whitman didn\u2019t believe Khan when she gave him\nwhat prosecutors said was inside information on Google and\nPolycom. On several occasions when Whitman believed Khan\nactually had inside tips, about Polycom earnings in April 2006\nand about planned acquisitions involving Hilton Hotels Inc. and\nKronos Inc., he refrained from trading on it, Anderson said.  When Khan told Whitman her Google source wanted to be paid\nfor the information she had provided, he told her she shouldn\u2019t\ndo it, Anderson told jurors.  Prosecutors in the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara\nhave won convictions or guilty pleas against 66 people charged\nwith  insider trading  since August 2009.  The case is U.S. v. Whitman, 12-cr-00125, U.S. District\nCourt, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).
