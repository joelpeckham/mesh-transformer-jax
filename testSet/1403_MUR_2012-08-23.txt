The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPresident Barack Obama assembled\nwhat he called his own basketball \u201cdream team,\u201d calling in\nretired basketball greats  Michael Jordan  and  Patrick Ewing  to\nhelp him raise more than $3 million for his re-election.  Jordan, who led the  Chicago Bulls  to six  National\nBasketball Association  championships, co-hosted a dinner last\nnight in New York for 120 people who paid $20,000 each to\nattend.  \u201cWe are in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re up by a few points,\nbut the other side is coming strong and they play a little\ndirty,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNobody knows better than Michael that, if\nyou\u2019ve got a little bit of a lead and there\u2019s about seven\nminutes left to go, that\u2019s when you put them away.\u201d  Obama is raising campaign cash as Republican presidential\ncandidate Mitt Romney and allied groups entered August with more\nmoney to spend than Obama and the Democrats.  Along with Ewing, who played most of his career with the\n New York Knicks  and was Jordan\u2019s teammate on the U.S.\u2019s 1992\nOlympic \u201cDream Team,\u201d the dinner at the  Lincoln Center \nincluded current NBA stars such as Carmelo Anthony of the Knicks\nand  Chris Bosh  of the  Miami Heat  along with Penny Hardaway and\nAlonzo Mourning, who are retired. NBA Commissioner  David Stern \nalso attended.  After dinner, Obama participated in an informal shoot-\naround with the NBA players and other guests, according to\ncampaign spokeswoman  Jen Psaki . That portion of the evening was\nclosed to the media.  No One-on-One  \u201cHe\u2019s not taking any one-on-one game tonight,\u201d Jordan\nsaid in introducing the president.  White House spokesman  Josh Earnest  said he didn\u2019t know if\nthe president has been practicing his shot, though he did play a\ngame last weekend.  Before dinner, the NBA players, along with Sheryl Swoopes,\nthe first player signed to the Women\u2019s National Basketball\nAssociation, participated in an autograph signing event for the\ncampaign that has sold 400 tickets at $250 per. Planned for\nlater was a skills camp, with tickets at $5,000 for 100 donors.  Obama sought to rally supporters earlier yesterday by\nwarning his challenger will have more money for the campaign.  \u201cWe will see the other side spend more money than we\u2019ve\never seen on ads,\u201d Obama told an audience in North Las Vegas,\nNevada.  Tax Cuts  \u201cMr. Romney, my opponent, his main economic plan is to\ngive everybody in this room a tax cut,\u201d Obama told the NBA\ncrowd in New York. \u201cNow some of you may find that appealing,\nbut the fact of the matter is we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d  Romney called yesterday\u2019s  Congressional Budget Office \nreport that  U.S. debt  will total 73 percent of the nation\u2019s\ngross domestic product this year \u201cunacceptable.\u201d It\u2019s the\nfourth year in a row that the U.S. would run a trillion-dollar\n budget deficit , according to the CBO.  \u201cI will finally cut federal spending, encourage growth and\nby virtue of those get America to a balanced budget,\u201d Romney\ntold supporters at a fundraising event yesterday in Little Rock,\nArkansas, that organizers said raised more than $2 million.  More than 250 tickets were sold at prices ranging from\n$2,500 to $50,000. Attendees, all from Arkansas, included\nSenator John Boozman, Representatives Tim Griffin, Rick Crawford\nand Steve Womack, as well as Chairman Claiborne Deming of El\nDorado, Arkansas-based  Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR)   Romney Fundraising  Romney, the Republican National Committee and two allied\nsuper-political action committees reported a combined bank\naccount balance of $169 million on July 31, according to\ndisclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission. That\ncompared with $107 million for the president, the Democratic\nNational Committee and the pro-Obama Priorities USA Action.  By itself, Obama\u2019s campaign committee outpaced Romney\u2019s. In\nthe last tally of campaign cash before the national party\nconventions, Obama brought in $49.2 million to $40.3 million for\nRomney in July. The Republican National Committee overcame that\ndeficit by itself, raising $37.9 million, while its Democratic\ncounterpart reported $10 million in receipts.  The Republican committee\u2019s cash-on-hand advantage of $88.8\nmillion to $15.4 million for the Democratic National Committee\nmore than overcame Obama\u2019s edge over Romney. The Obama campaign\ncommittee reported $87.7 million in its bank account entering\nAugust compared with $30.2 million for Romney.  \u2018Science Class\u2019  Obama used the New York fundraiser to again decry the\ncomments on rape and abortion by Todd Akin, the Republican U.S.\nSenate candidate in Missouri. Akin, a six-term congressman\nseeking to unseat Democratic Senator  Claire McCaskill , said\nduring an Aug. 19 interview that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely\nleads to pregnancy.  \u201cThe interesting thing here is this is an individual who\nsits on the House Committee on Science and Technology but\nsomehow missed science class,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nrepresentative of the desire to go backward instead of forward\nand the fights that we thought were settled 20, 30 years ago.\u201d  Obama\u2019s remarks were laden with sports metaphors, and he\ndrew a comparison with what he did for increased political\nparticipation in the 2008 election with how Jordan spurred\ninterest among non-basketball fans in the 1990s.  \u201cSo this is my dream team,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare\nthat I come to an event where I am like the fifth or sixth most\ninteresting person.\u201d  He made a point to mention NBA all-stars who played at the\nUniversity of  North Carolina  at  Chapel Hill  in a key\nbattleground state. \u201cWe have some Tar Heels in the House,\u201d he\nsaid.  Jordan has \u201chis North Carolina shorts under his suit,\u201d\nObama said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s important to note.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nHans Nichols in Washington at \n hnichols2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nSteven Komarow at \n skomarow1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Murphy Oil Corporation was 32.28620147705078 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Murphy Oil Corporation was ",
