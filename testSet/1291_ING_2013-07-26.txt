 "context": "The following article called 'AIA First-Half Profit Jumps 34% to Record, Beating Estimate' was published on 2013-07-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAIA Group Ltd. (1299) , the  second-largest \nAsia-based insurer by market value, reported a high-than-expected 34 percent increase in first-half profit, helped by\nacquisitions and paper gains from equity investments.  Net income for the Hong Kong-based insurer climbed to a\nrecord $1.93 billion in the six months to May 31, or 16 cents a\nshare, from $1.44 billion, or 12 cents, a year earlier, it said\nin a  statement  to the city\u2019s stock exchange today. Six analysts\nhad a $1.6 billion median adjusted profit estimate, according to\n data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Today\u2019s announcement marked the fifth time AIA beat analyst\nprofit estimates in six half-year periods as a publicly listed\ncompany, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. AIA overtook\nPing An Insurance Group Co. as the second-largest Asia-based\ninsurer by market value this year.  \u201cIt\u2019s strong result across the board,\u201d Arjan van Veen, a\nHong Kong-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in an e-mail. \u201cIt should be well received.\u201d  AIA\u2019s shares rose 0.4 percent to HK$35.85 at the close of\ntrading in  Hong Kong . They extended this year\u2019s gain to 19\npercent,  compared  to the 0.8 percent drop in the Hang Seng\nFinance Index tracking 12 banks, insurers and the city\u2019s\nexchange operator.  AIA\u2019s after-tax operating profit grew 17 percent to $1.3\nbillion. Value of new business increased 26 percent to a six-month record $645 million, exceeding the median estimate of $633\nmillion of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  New Businesses  Chief Executive Officer Mark Tucker has been focusing on\nnew business value, or projected future profitability of new\npolicies, as a gauge of his success in rejuvenating a company\nthat lost market share during the global financial crisis.\nStronger premium growth in lower-margin  markets , including\nMalaysia and  South Korea , helped boost it in the six months.  Annualized new premium, which tracks new policy sales,\nincreased 29 percent to $1.53 billion. New business margin, or\nnew business value as a percentage of annualized new premium,\nslipped 1 percentage point to 41.6 percent.  AIA\u2019s embedded value, a measure used to assess the economic\nworth of life insurers, gained 3 percent to $32.2 billion over\nthe six months. It declared an interim dividend of 13.93 Hong\nKong cents a share, a 13 percent increase over a year earlier.  \u201cOur positive growth momentum has been sustained for the\nfirst half of 2013,\u201d Tucker said of the results on a conference\ncall with journalists today. \u201cWe\u2019ve just begun to tap the\npotential for growth in our markets.\u201d  Asia Expansion  AIA has been expanding in smaller markets and pushing more\nprofitable add-on policies such as accident and health products.  It completed the $1.7 billion  purchase  of ING Groep NV\u2019s\n Malaysia  business in December, boosting its market standing in\none of  Southeast Asia \u2019s most promising life insurance markets to\nfirst from fourth, it said in a statement in October.  Malaysia contributed 10 percent of AIA\u2019s annualized new\npremium in the six months, up from 6 percent a year earlier. Its\nshare of the company\u2019s new business value rose almost two\npercentage points to 7.6 percent.  \u201cThat\u2019s a terrific start,\u201d Tucker said of the Malaysia\nbusiness during the call. \u201cThis will be an enduring effect.\u201d  AIA\u2019s net mark-to-market gains from equity investments\ndoubled to $659 million from a year earlier, boosting profit.\nStocks in AIA\u2019s largest markets rose 9 percent in the six\nmonths, Credit Suisse\u2019s van Veen and Frances Feng wrote in a\nJune 26 report.  Currency Impact  The insurer cautioned against volatility arising from\nuncertainty over when the U.S. Federal Reserve will start\nwithdrawing liquidity support and over  China \u2019s efforts to rein\nin credit growth.  AIA operates in 17 Asian markets. The insurer, which\ncollects local-currency premiums in those countries yet reports\nfinancial figures in dollar, booked a $168 million loss from\nforeign-exchange movements in its embedded value calculation.  Morgan Stanley analysts led by Ben Lin cut forecasts for\nAIA\u2019s 2013 to 2015 full-year new business value growth by as\nmuch as 4 percent because of expeccted Asian currencies\ndepreciation, they said in a June 19 report.
