The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGlobal financial markets will face\n\u201crenewed turbulence\u201d as structural deficits and public debt in\nEurope and the U.S. hamper economic growth, Aberdeen Asset\nManagement said.  \n Rising asset prices, driven by liquidity, could create\ninstability, said Aberdeen, which manages more than $243.1\nbillion of global assets. Emerging market officials need to\nnormalize their monetary policies, which may mean interest-rate\nincreases later this year or in 2011 as inflation accelerates,\naccording to a statement by Aberdeen.  \n \u201cThe emerging markets and, in particular, Asia remain\nbright spots,\u201d  Donald Amstad , director at Aberdeen Asset\nManagement Asia, said in the statement. \u201cWe see the larger\nAsian economies with their expanding internal markets continuing\nto decouple and this will support currency appreciation.\u201d  \n The  MSCI World Index  has dropped 7.6 percent this year,\nfollowing a 27 percent rally in 2009. That compares with a 4.8\npercent drop in the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index this year. U.K.\nChancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  on June 22 detailed\nwhat the government called the biggest deficit cuts in peacetime,\nspurring concern among equity investors that slower economic\ngrowth may hurt returns.  \n \u2018Buy\u2019 Korea, Indonesia  \n The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index has declined 3.6 percent\nthis year after data last week shows new-home sales sank to a\nrecord low and the Federal Reserve signaled that European\nindebtedness may lead to a weaker U.S. economy.  \n Stephen Docherty , Aberdeen Asset Management\u2019s head of\nglobal equities, forecast returns for equity to be \u201cin the\nsingle digits\u201d this year, without being more specific,\naccording to the statement.  \n China\u2019s yuan will rise 3 percent to 5 percent per year in\nthe next \u201ccouple of years,\u201d Amstad said at a media briefing in\nHong Kong today.  \n The People\u2019s Bank of China pledged June 19 to make its\ncurrency more flexible. The yuan had been held at 6.83 per\ndollar since July 2008 after a 21 percent gain the three prior\nyears, in an effort to shield exporters from the global crisis.  \n Investors should buy stocks in other Asian countries\nincluding Korea, Singapore and Indonesia, on expectations that\nAsian currencies are generally going to appreciate, Amstad said.  \n Buying Hong Kong stocks, given the city\u2019s currency is\nlinked to the U.S. dollar, probably  isn\u2019t a good idea , he said.  \n \u201cPatchy\u201d economic data from the U.S. suggest that\nmonetary policy will stay \u201caccommodative for longer than\npreviously envisaged,\u201d Aberdeen said. Europe\u2019s sovereign-debt\ncrisis has forced nations to take drastic austerity measures to\nretain confidence in stocks and bond markets, it said.  \n Deflation, or a general decline in prices, is possible\nwithin the next few years, Nobel Prize-winning economist  Paul Krugman  said June 22.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Hanny Wan  in Hong Kong at \n hwan3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was 26.778179168701172 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of MSCI Inc was ",
