 "context": "The following article called 'Blackstone Venture Said to Sell Debt for Extended Stay' was published on 2012-11-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBlackstone Group LP (BX) , Centerbridge\nPartners LP and Paulson & Co. plan to sell $3.5 billion of debt\nto refinance their 2010 purchase of Extended Stay Hotels,\nenabling them to recoup about half their equity investment,\naccording to two people with knowledge of the transaction.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  will arrange $2.5\nbillion of loans using the commercial mortgage-backed securities\nmarket and $1 billion of mezzanine loans, said the people, who\nasked not to be identified because the details aren\u2019t public.  The investment companies bought Extended Stay at a\nbankruptcy auction for $4.2 billion, using $2.7 billion of debt\nfinancing and $1.5 billion of equity, invested equally by the\nthree firms. Since they bought Extended Stay, when the\ncommercial real estate market was close to a bottom, its cash\nflows have increased more than 40 percent amid a recovery in the\n hotel  business, the people said. The owners invested about $420\nmillion to renovate rooms and consolidate properties under the\nExtended Stay brand name.  Armel Leslie, a spokesman for the New York-based hedge fund\nrun by billionaire  John Paulson , declined to comment.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone, and Susanne\nClark, a spokeswoman for Centerbridge, didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to requests for comment. Centerbridge, based in New\nYork, was co-founded by Mark Gallogly, a former Blackstone\npartner.  Blackstone previously bought the lodging company, when it\nwas known as Extended Stay America, for $3 billion in 2004,\nafter the 2001 terrorist attacks caused hotel revenue and\nproperty values to tumble. It sold the company for $8 billion in\n2007 to investors led by Lightstone Group, then joined\nCenterbridge and Paulson to buy it again after the global credit\ncrisis forced Extended Stay into bankruptcy.  The planned debt sale was reported earlier today by the\nWall Street Journal.
