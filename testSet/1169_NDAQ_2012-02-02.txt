 "context": "The following article called 'CEOs\u2019 Political Donations Should Reward Courage: Jason S. Grumet' was published on 2012-02-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAs paralysis in Congress brought the\nU.S. to the brink of a government shutdown late last year,\n Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz let loose\na corporate primal scream.  In an open letter, he accused members of Congress of\nputting \u201cpartisan and ideological purity over the well-being of\nthe people,\u201d and urged that they be punished. He pointed out,\nrightly, that the deterioration of our political system is at\nleast partly caused by the ever-expanding election cycle and the\ntreadmill of fundraising. And, in a laudable and rare effort to\ncombine deeds with words, he vowed to cease all campaign\ndonations and urged business leaders and voters to do the same.  More than 100 senior executives -- including  AOL Inc. (AOL)  CEO\n Tim Armstrong ,  Nucor Corp. (NUE)  CEO Dan DiMicco and  Nasdaq OMX Group\nInc. (NDAQ)  CEO Robert Greifeld -- have signed on. Yet their effort\ndoesn\u2019t go far enough. By taking their marbles and going home,\nSchultz and his colleagues are unlikely to disrupt the partisan\ntoxicity that pervades our politics. Recent Supreme Court\ndecisions ensure that any effort to meaningfully restrict the\nflow of money into politics would require a constitutional\namendment. By disengaging from political giving, corporate\npragmatists only increase the peril faced by politicians with\nthe courage to collaborate.  There is a better way for these leaders to use their\ncheckbooks to bring about change and create real incentives that\nreward and protect members of Congress who work across the\naisle.  Targeted Contributions  Imagine if Schultz and his \u201cUpward Spiral\u201d CEOs\ncoordinated contributions to reward specific acts of\ncollaboration. One place to look would be the debt-focused,\nbipartisan \u201cGang of Six\u201d led by Senators Mark Warner, a\nVirginia Democrat, and  Saxby Chambliss , a Georgia Republican,\nwhich has been steadfast in the effort to sustain a beachhead of\ncollaboration after the so-called supercommittee of lawmakers\nfailed to agree on a deficit-reduction plan in November.  There are other examples: Senator  Patrick Leahy , a Vermont\nDemocrat, and Representative  Lamar Smith , a Texas Republican,\nrecently led a successful effort on patent-reform legislation.\nSenators  Robert Menendez , a New Jersey Democrat, and  Mark Kirk ,\nan Illinois Republican, championed a unanimously approved\namendment to the annual defense authorization bill imposing\nsanctions on Iran\u2019s central bank. Republican Senator  Tom Coburn \nof Oklahoma, a fiscal conservative, should be acknowledged for\nvoting to support the Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction package,\na move that earned him the wrath of anti-tax ideologues.  Equally notable was a rare compromise between Senators\nBarbara Boxer, a California Democrat, and  James Inhofe , an\nOklahoma Republican, who traveled from the outer edges of their\ncaucuses to agree on a two-year transportation bill that\nincludes funding for highways and provisions to alleviate\ncongestion and air pollution.  To have a meaningful effect, the praise and contributions\nof CEOs must not be directed principally toward the few\nremaining congressional \u201ccentrists.\u201d The reality of our\nelectoral system guarantees that Congress will be dominated by\npartisans for the foreseeable future. The goal must be to reward\nthese members when they find ways to collaborate that are\nconsistent with their values.  If all \u201cUpward Spiral\u201d executives simultaneously donated\nthe maximum, each of these candidates would have an additional\n$250,000 in their campaign coffers. Beyond financial support,\nthere is also a great need for corporate leaders to engage\nintellectually in diverse and politically active coalitions to\npromote broad-based, substantive and political solutions.  In the current toxic environment, public disillusionment\nleads to disengagement that further undermines our ability to\nsolve any of the real problems we face. Our nation\u2019s CEOs\npossess the rational self-interest and means to change this\ndynamic. By combining policy insight with strategic financial\ncontributions, business leaders can provide much needed support\nto the elected officials most capable of making a difference.  (Jason S.
