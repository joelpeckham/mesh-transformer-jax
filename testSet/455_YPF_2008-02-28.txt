The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRepsol YPF SA ,  Spain 's  largest  oil\ncompany, plans to spend 32.8 billion euros ($49.5 billion)\nthrough 2012 in a bid to accelerate profit growth.  \n The investment plan is aimed at almost tripling earnings\nduring the period and raising dividends, Repsol said in a\npresentation today. The new strategy replaces the company's 28\nbillion-euro spending program for the five years ending in 2009.  \n Chairman  Antonio Brufau  has sought to stem five years of\ndwindling oil and gas reserves and 10 consecutive  quarters  of\nfalling output by shifting exploration and production away from\n Latin America , where governments have capped growth. He's relying\non projects in North Africa, Central America and the  Gulf of\nMexico  to spur output.  \n ``I'm not sure exactly how they are going to make this work;\nthe targets may be a little too optimistic,'' said Jacobo Penaranda, a  fund manager  at Barclays Fondos in Madrid, where he\nhelps oversee about 7 billion euros, including Repsol shares.  \n Outside Argentina, the company forecasts discovering 25\npercent more oil than it pumps through 2012, Brufau said in a\ntelevision interview today. Output will grow 5 percent a year to\nat least 410,000 barrels of oil a day, he said.  \n For the overall company, reserve replacement through 2012\nwill be no more than 70 percent of the oil and gas produced, he\nforecast.  \n Profit  \n Fourth-quarter  net income  rose 56 percent to 740 million\neuros, the Madrid-based company said today. Full-year profit was\n3.19 billion euros. The company rose 0.7 percent to close at\n23.08 euros in  Madrid  trading today.  \n Earnings grew 58 percent between 2003 and 2007, according to\nBloomberg calculations. Brufau said  earnings  in 2012 will be 2.8\ntimes 2008 profit, making the rate of growth five times greater\nthan in the previous period.  \n ``There is nothing magic about these numbers, they're\nfact,'' said Brufau. ``More refining, more LNG and higher prices,\nand our estimates for prices are conservative.''  \n Repsol aims to spend 9 billion euros exploring for oil and\ngas outside Argentina. The company plans to invest 10.5 billion\neuros in refining, its second-largest business, as it expands the\nBilbao and Cartagena plants in Spain.  \n In Argentina, Repsol will invest 7.8 billion euros on\nimproving recovery. It has reserves of about 4.2 billion barrels\nof oil and gas in  Argentina , Brufau said, without commenting on\nhow much may be recovered after the investment. Repsol will also\nexplore for new reserves this year.  \n North Africa  \n The company aims to sell 18 billion cubic meters of\n liquefied natural gas  in 2012, up from 4 billion cubic meters\nplanned for 2008. It's planning to have two new LNG plants\nrunning in Peru and Canada by then.  \n Repsol has so far focused on exploration in North Africa,\nespecially Libya, and on boosting production in  Trinidad &\nTobago .  \n In December, Repsol found gas in  Bolivia  and joined a\nproject to search for the fuel in  Angola . This year, the company\ndiscovered deposits in the Peruvian jungle and won licenses to\nexplore off  Alaska ,  Mexico  and Spain.  \n Under the previous investment plan, Repsol said it would\nincrease production to 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a\nday in 2009. It was forced to lower that forecast to 1.18 million\nbarrels a day after writing down reserves by a quarter in 2006.\nThe company will meet that 1.18 million target, Brufau said today\nin a meeting with journalists.  \n Tarragona Expansion  \n Separately, he said Repsol may expand its refinery in\nTarragona, eastern Spain, costing about 2 billion euros. As for\nSpanish partner  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS) , Brufau said Repsol will\nsupport every strategic decision made by that gas supplier.  \n Repsol's 2007 dividend will rise to around 1 euro a share,\nthough dividend growth won't necessarily keep pace with profit\ngrowth, he said.  \n Production in Argentina declined at a faster-than-forecast\nrate, and higher taxes in Bolivia were responsible for the\nwritedown of reserves, mostly gas. Repsol also lost control of\nits ventures in Bolivia and Venezuela as their respective\npresidents,  Evo Morales  and  Hugo Chavez , nationalized resources.  \n Repsol has not yet reached an agreement with  Ecuador  over\nthe nation's plans to renegotiate production contracts, Brufau\nsaid.  \n ``We have suffered more than most from energy nationalism,''\nBrufau told analysts in a Webcast today.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nKristian Rix in Madrid at \n krix@bloomberg.net ;\nVictor Marquez in Madrid at \n vmarquez@bloomberg.net   \n To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDaniel Tilles in London at \n dtilles@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of YPF Sociedad Anonima was 26.033092498779297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of YPF Sociedad Anonima was ",
