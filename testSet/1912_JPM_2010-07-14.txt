 "context": "The following article called 'UniCredit Step-Up Hybrid Notes May Signal Watered-Down Basel Capital Rules' was published on 2010-07-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUniCredit SpA \u2019s 500 million-euro\n($635 million) hybrid bond issue includes features that\nregulators said they no longer want in bank capital securities,\nsignalling rules being discussed today may be watered down,\naccording to CreditSights Inc.  \n Italy\u2019s biggest  lender  priced the so-called Tier 1 undated\nnotes to yield 9.375 percent, according to a banker involved in\nthe transaction, who declined to be identified before the sale\nis completed. If Milan-based UniCredit chooses not to redeem the\nnotes after 10 years it must pay an increased interest rate\nknown as a step-up, the sale prospectus shows.  \n Regulators said in December that bonds with step-up\ninterest should no longer qualify as bank capital, or debt that\nfails before other securities and thus soaks up losses. The\n Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  is meeting today to\ndecide new rules on what will count as capital after lenders\u2019\nprotection was shown to be inadequate by the worst financial\ncrisis in 70 years.  \n \u201cEither UniCredit are taking a risk and just hoping\nthey\u2019ll be able to include these in Tier 1, or they\u2019ve got the\nnod from the Bank of Italy,\u201d said  John Raymond , an analyst at\nCreditSights in London. \u201cNational regulators always had an\nelement of discretion and that may continue more than people\nthink.\u201d  \n The notes comply with current regulations and \u201cenvisaged\u201d\nnew rules, according to a Rome-based spokeswoman for UniCredit.  \n Fixed Interest  \n UniCredit\u2019s new Tier 1 notes pay a fixed rate of interest,\nwith the issuer having the option of calling the securities\nafter 10 years, according to the deal prospectus. Failure to\nexercise the call resets the coupon to a higher floating rate.  \n Interest on the bonds won\u2019t be paid if UniCredit has no\nprofit to distribute, according to the prospectus. If there\u2019s a\nloss and UniCredit finds itself short of capital, or if its\ncapital ratio slips below 6 percent, the value of the notes will\nreduce to allow the bank to meet regulatory needs. The value of\nthe bonds will be written back up once the issuer returns to\nprofit, the prospectus shows.  \n Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are\nmanaging the bond sale with UniCredit.  \n The new regulations on risk taking and capital, known as\nthe Basel III rules, will attempt to fix shortcomings of the so-\ncalled Basel II accord, which was initiated by lenders in the\nlate 1990s and lowered capital requirements by as much as 29\npercent for some banks.  \n Absorbing Losses  \n The aim is to ensure banks won\u2019t drag down economies or\nforce taxpayers to bail them out by insisting they hold more\ncapital that\u2019s better able to absorb losses. The Basel committee\nmay publish the study later this month or in August, according\nto a person with knowledge of the matter.  \n Under Basel III, \u201cbank debt capital is going to have a\nsignificant amount of loss absorption in it,\u201d said  Paul Owens ,\nwho helps manage the equivalent of about $1.8 billion as a\ncredit analyst at Liontrust Investment Services Ltd. in London.  \n Buyers of Tier 1 bonds get paid after other debt investors\nand before equity investors. Bonds are a cheaper form of capital\nfor banks to issue than stock because they pay interest from\npre-tax rather than after-tax earnings.  \n Banks have lobbied to dilute the new capital regulations,\narguing that it will hurt their profit and stifle their ability\nto lend money.  \n \u201cReturn on equity and cost of capital are going to suffer,\nthere\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d said  Bryn Jones , who manages the\nabout $55 million at Rathbone Unit Trust Management Ltd. in\nLondon.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n John Glover  in London at \n johnglover@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 29.86150550842285 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
