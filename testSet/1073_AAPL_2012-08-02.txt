 "context": "The following article called 'Sharp Widens Loss Forecast as LCD Panel Demand Slumps' was published on 2012-08-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSharp Corp. (6753) , maker of Aquos\ntelevisions, said it will cut 5,000 jobs after widening its\nannual loss forecast to 250 billion yen ($3.2 billion) as demand\nfor its sets slumped.  The  workforce reduction , the company\u2019s first since 1950, is\npart of a plan to reduce fixed costs by 100 billion yen, the\nOsaka-based company said in a statement today. The loss outlook\ncompares with the  average  65.3 billion-yen loss estimate of 16\nanalysts compiled by Bloomberg, and is more than eight times the\ncompany\u2019s previous  projection  of a 30 billion-yen loss.  The Japanese electronics maker joins rivals  Sony Corp. (6758)  and\n Panasonic Corp. (6752)  in planning job cuts following record losses\ncaused by lower TV prices and demand, and a yen trading near its\npostwar high, reducing the value of overseas earnings. The steps\ncome after Sharp unveiled a plan to separate its TV panel unit\nand turned to  Foxconn Technology Group (2354)  and founder Terry Gou for\n133 billion yen in funding after forecasting its second straight\nannual loss.  \u201cWe want to recover earnings by undertaking unprecedented\nrestructuring measures swiftly,\u201d Tetsuo Onishi, managing\ndirector in charge of accounting, told reporters today in  Tokyo .  Foxconn\u2019s flagship Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., the\nassembler of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPads, will start buying panels from\nSharp\u2019s display venture this quarter, three months earlier than\nplanned under a March agreement, Sharp President Takashi Okuda\nsaid in June.  Hon Hai  \u201cInvestors are waiting to confirm progress in what the\nmanagement promised to do in June,\u201d said Keita Wakabayashi, a\nTokyo-based  analyst  at Mito Securities Co. \u201cWhether teaming up\nwith Hon Hai will reward investors or not depends on the\nTaiwanese group\u2019s marketing power of large panels.\u201d  Sharp\u2019s net loss was 138.4 billion yen in the three months\nended June 30, widening from 49.3 billion yen a year earlier,\nthe Osaka-based company said. The average of four analysts\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg was a loss of 76 billion yen.  The large LCD-making plant, in which Gou gained a 37.6\npercent stake, will increase its utilization rate to 90 percent\nthis year to meet orders from Foxconn, Okuda said.  The LCD operation will probably lose 105 billion yen this\nfiscal year, Sharp said today. That compares with the 10\nbillion-yen projected by the company three months ago.  Full-year LCD sales will probably be 8 million units,\ncompared with an earlier projection for 10 million.  Okuda\u2019s Challenge  The electronics maker promoted Okuda, 58, in April to\nreplace  Mikio Katayama , who became chairman, after predicting\nthe worst loss in its 100-year history amid slumping demand.  Sharp shares last month fell to their lowest since 1975\nafter the Nikkei newspaper reported the company will probably\npost a quarterly loss and plans to cut jobs for the first time\nin more than half a century.  On July 27 Sharp\u2019s BBB+ long-term  credit rating  was put on\nreview for a possible downgrade at  Standard & Poor\u2019s  because of\ndeteriorating TV and panel businesses. Refinancing risk for the\ncompany\u2019s convertible bonds  maturing  in September 2013 will also\nbe assessed, S&P said.  The stock rose 0.8 percent to close at 267 yen in Tokyo\ntrading before the earnings were released, trimming its loss\nthis year to 60 percent. Sharp has the biggest  percentage\ndecline  on the benchmark  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  this year, which has added\n2.3 percent.  The operating loss will probably be 100 billion yen this\nfiscal year, compared with the company\u2019s previous forecast for\nprofit of 20 billion yen, Sharp said.  Billionaire Gou invested 66 billion yen for the 37.6\npercent stake in Sakai Display Products Corp., which runs a\n10th-generation panel plant, the LCD industry\u2019s most advanced.\nFoxconn Group\u2019s planned purchase of  a 9.9 stake in Sharp  for 550\nyen apiece, the other part of the March agreement, is pending\napproval.
