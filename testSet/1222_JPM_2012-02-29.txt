 "context": "The following article called 'Slowdown Spurs Confidence as Bonds Rally Most in 18 Months: Turkey Credit' was published on 2012-02-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTurkey \u2019s  dollar bonds  are poised for\ntheir best month in 1 1/2 years as slowing economic growth spurs\nspeculation demand for imported goods will ease, narrowing the\ncountry\u2019s record current-account deficit.  The yield on Turkish dollar bonds fell the most since July\n2010 this month, outperforming 39 of the 45 emerging markets in\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBI Global index. The  extra yield  for\nTurkey over U.S. Treasuries dropped 56 basis points to 338.  The world\u2019s second-fastest expansion after China among\nmajor economies last year helped send the current-account gap to\nmore than 10 percent of gross domestic product, prompting\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. to warn of a possible recession.\nIndustrial production slowed and capacity utilization fell for a\nfourth month, government data show. Central bank Governor Erdem Basci cited slowing growth for two interest rate cuts this year.  \u201cFor me, nothing could be better for Turkey than a nice\nrecession,\u201d  Edwin Gutierrez , a  fund manager  who helps oversee\nabout $7.5 billion in emerging-market debt at Aberdeen Asset\nManagement Plc in London, said by phone on Feb. 27. \u201cNothing\nwould do more to address that deficit than to have an import\ncollapse which would come from a softening of growth.\u201d  Aberdeen bought some of Turkey\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2022\nsold this year, Gutierrez said. The yield on the debt fell two\nbasis points, or 0.02 percentage point, today to 5.36 percent,\ncompared with 6.14 percent when they first traded on Jan. 23,\ndata compiled by Bloomberg show.  Achilles Heel  Turkish economic growth may slow to 0.4 percent this year,\nfrom 8.3 percent in 2011, according to a  report  prepared by\nInternational Monetary Fund staff for a meeting of the Group of\n20 nations in Mexico City on Jan. 19. The government forecasts\nthat Europe\u2019s eighth-biggest economy will grow at least 4\npercent, down from a pace of 9.6 percent in the first nine\nmonths of 2011, which was topped only by  China  among the G-20.  Turkey\u2019s  current-account  deficit narrowed for a second\nmonth in December, its first back-to-back drop in a year, the\ncentral bank said Feb. 13. The 12-month cumulative deficit\nshrank to $77.1 billion, or about 10 percent of output.  \u201cTurkish bonds benefited massively from the previous two\ncurrent-account data releases,\u201d  Felix Herrmann , a Frankfurt-\nbased analyst at DZ Bank AG, said in e-mailed comments. \u201cThe\ncurrent-account deficit is considered the Achilles heel of the\nTurkish economy.\u201d  Lira Rallies  The nation\u2019s central bank has been trying to pare growth\nwithout causing a recession after record-low  interest rates \nspurred demand for imports and sent the current-account g\nsoaring. Reduced concern about Turkey\u2019s ability to finance the\ngap has helped the lira gain 8.5 percent against the dollar this\nyear, recouping some of last year\u2019s 18 percent loss, the biggest\namong emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The central bank spent about $15 billion of its foreign-\nexchange reserves since August last year to support the lira,\ncentral bank governor Basci said Jan. 6.  Turkey\u2019s dependency on foreign financing will leave it\nvulnerable to \u201cmore serious downside risks over the long\nterm,\u201d  Ahmet Akarli , Goldman\u2019s economist for the region based\nin  London , said in an e-mailed report on Feb. 10. The deficit\nwill narrow to around 8 percent of GDP by mid-2012 before\nwidening to around 9.5 percent by early 2013, Akarli said.  Raising Forecast  Goldman boosted its forecast for Turkey\u2019s economic growth\nthis year to 2.5 percent from 0.8 percent estimated in December.\nThe bank had predicted a likely contraction for late 2011 and\nearly 2012, according to a report in December. Bank of America\nMerrill Lynch also said in December Turkey faced a possible\nrecession.  Rising crude prices risk pushing up inflation as Turkey\nimports all its oil, the central bank said in the minutes of its\nFeb. 21 interest-rate meeting. The bank cut its overnight\nlending rate one percentage point to 11.5 percent at that\nmeeting because the \u201crisk of a rapid capital outflow has\nreduced\u201d following monetary expansion in developed economies,\naccording to the minutes.  The lira strengthened for a third day today, gaining 0.5\npercent to 1.7434 per dollar, the strongest in more than a week.\nThe currency has appreciated 1.9 percent so far in February.  Yields on  two-year benchmark bonds  in liras fell for the\nsecond day, dropping 10 basis points to 9.13 percent. They have\nfallen 31 basis points in February, after declining 160 basis\npoints in January.  Default Risk  The cost of protecting Turkish bonds against default using\nfive-year credit-default swaps fell seven basis points to 242,\ncompared with a spread of 188 for  Russia , which is rated three\nlevels higher by  Standard & Poor\u2019s , and 200 for  Poland , rated\nfive levels higher, according to CMA, which is owned by CME\nGroup Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the\nprivately-negotiated market. Turkey\u2019s credit default swaps have\nfallen 35 basis points this month, the most since October.  Turkish contracts cost 26 basis points less than the\naverage for countries in central and eastern  Europe , the  Middle\nEast  and  Africa  included in the Markit iTraxx SovX CEEMEA Index.\nThe swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the\nunderlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government\nor company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service rates Turkey Ba2, two steps below\ninvestment grade, with a positive outlook. S&P also rates Turkey\nat two levels below investment grade at BB.  Debt Rally  A decline in the extra yield on Turkey\u2019s dollar bonds over\nU.S. notes this month snapped three months of increases,\nJPMorgan indexes show.  Demand for emerging market assets has been fueled by signs\nof economic recovery in the U.S. and unlimited three-year loans\nfrom the  European Central Bank  to euro-area banks.  The average spread over U.S. Treasuries for dollar bonds\nsold by  emerging-markets  declined for a second month in\nFebruary, falling 43 basis points to 369 basis points, according\nto JPMorgan.  \u201cTurkey\u2019s dollar-denominated bonds have long\nunderperformed relative to other emerging-market Eurobonds\nbecause of the country risk perceptions,\u201d Bugra Bilgi, a hedge\nfund manager at Garanti Asset Management in Istanbul, said in e-\nmailed comments. \u201cIt is possible that expectations of\nimprovement in the current-account deficit fueled buying for\nthose bonds.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nJason Webb in London at \n jwebb25@bloomberg.net ;\nSelcuk Gokoluk in Istanbul at \n sgokoluk@bloomberg.net .
