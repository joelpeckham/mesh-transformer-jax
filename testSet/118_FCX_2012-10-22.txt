 "context": "The following article called 'Freeport\u2019s Adjusted Earnings Miss Estimates as Costs Rise' was published on 2012-10-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFreeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ,\nthe biggest publicly traded copper producer, reported third-\nquarter profit that missed analysts\u2019 estimates for the first\ntime in 17  quarters  as costs rose and gold sales fell more than\nexpected.  Net income dropped 22 percent to $824 million, or 86 cents\na share, from $1.05 billion, or $1.10, a year ago, Phoenix-based\nFreeport said today in a statement. Earnings excluding credits\nfor environmental adjustments and tax claims were 68 cents a\nshare, trailing the 73-cent average  estimate  of 21 analysts\nsurveyed by Bloomberg.  Net cash costs rose to $1.62 a pound of copper from 80\ncents in the third quarter of 2011, according to the statement\nCosts were higher mainly because of lower volumes in  Indonesia ,\nthe company said.  \u201cThe miss was largely attributable to higher-than-expected\nproduction costs across all divisions, continuing a trend seen\nacross the sector,\u201d  Tony Robson , an analyst at BMO Capital\nMarkets in  London , said in a note today.  Revenue declined 15 percent to $4.42 billion, beating the\n$4.36 billion average of 13 estimates. Copper sales totaled 922\nmillion pounds, compared with 947 million pounds a year earlier\nand a July 19 forecast of 885 million pounds. Brian Yu, an\nanalyst at Citigroup Inc. in  San Francisco , had estimated sales\nof 888 million pounds.  Gold Sales  Gold sales fell 51 percent to 202,000 ounces, missing a\nJuly forecast of 225,000 ounces, Freeport said. Gold volumes\nreflected changes to the mine plan at the company\u2019s Grasberg\noperation in Indonesia and a slower-than-expected ramp-up at the\nsite\u2019s Deep Ore Zone underground project.  \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a shortfall there on the gold\nside but nothing really shocking there coming out of the\nquarter,\u201d Kuni Chen, an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in\n Stamford ,  Connecticut , said by telephone.  Freeport\u2019s Indonesian operations had sales of 195 million\npounds of copper and 384,000 ounces of gold in the third\nquarter, compared with 253 million pounds and 384,000 ounces a\nyear ago.  The Grasberg mine was halted for more than two weeks in the\nfirst quarter and required \u201cextensive repairs\u201d after violence\nflared among employees in the aftermath of a three-month strike\nlast year, Freeport said. Grasberg, which has the world\u2019s\nlargest recoverable copper reserves, accounted for 19 percent of\nFreeport\u2019s revenue last year.  Copper Prices  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal\nExchange averaged $7,720.85 a metric ton in the quarter, 14\npercent less than a year earlier on concern that an economic\nslowdown in  China , the biggest consumer of the metal, would\nweaken demand.  Freeport cut its forecast for 2012 gold sales to 1 million\nounces. Copper sales are still expected to be 3.6 billion pounds\nthis year and may rise 19 percent, to 4.3 billion pounds, in\n2013, the company said. It also forecast sales of 1.4 million\nounces of gold and 90 million pounds of molybdenum next year.  Freeport, which operates mines in Indonesia,  Africa  and the\nAmericas, plans to increase annual copper  output  by more than 25\npercent in the next three years, Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said July 19.  The shares fell 1.5 percent to $40.58 at the close in  New\nYork .
