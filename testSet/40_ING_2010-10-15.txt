 "context": "The following article called 'Structured Bonds Multiply as Ruble Debt Spurs Deutsche Bank: Russia Credit' was published on 2010-10-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSales of structured notes\ndenominated in rubles may quadruple in the next year as\ninvestors snap up the securities to profit from the economic\nrebound in the world\u2019s biggest energy-exporting nation.  Issuance of credit-linked notes, whose returns are based on\nthe performance of underlying debt, will surge three or fourfold\nwithin 12 months, according to Metropol IFC, an independent\ninvestment bank in Moscow. While banks disclosed 7.3 billion\nrubles ($243 million) of structured debt sales this year, the\nactual amount is \u201cmuch larger,\u201d said  Tim McCarthy , who helps\noversee $1 billion of emerging-market assets as a fund manager\nat Geneva-based  Valartis  Group Asset Management. Disclosed deals\nmay reach $1 billion by the end of next year, he said.  Barclays Capital ,  Deutsche Bank AG  and JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nare reviving the market for structured debt after 2.3 billion\nrubles of sales in 2009 as investors seek ways to sidestep\nrequirements that include registering with a local broker, a\nprocess that can take as long as a year. Russia\u2019s recovery from\nits worst recession on record is luring foreign investors\nexpecting ruble bonds to catch up after underperforming Brazil\nand China this year.  \u201cRussian structured notes are poised for significant\ngrowth in the next eight to 12 months, driven by investors\u2019\nappetite for riskier assets,\u201d  Mark Rubinstein , head of research\nat Metropol IFC, said in a phone interview.  Russian ruble debt returned 4.4 percent this year compared\nwith 12.6 percent for Brazil and an average of 7.2 percent for\nthe countries included in JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s Emerging Local\nMarkets Plus Index.  Barclays, Deutsche Bank  Barclays, based in London, sold 2.5 billion rubles of 11.2\npercent coupon structured notes due in December 2014 at a price\nof 118.683 to yield about 6.1 percent, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The notes package the Russian\ngovernment\u2019s 11.2 percent coupon OFZs due in December 2014.\nSince the Barclays notes were first issued on May 21, the OFZs\nhave gained 1.6 percent, lowering the yield to 6.6 percent.  Deutsche Bank raised 330 million rubles in a sale of three-\nyear structured notes yielding about 5.3 percent on Sept. 24,\ndata compiled by Bloomberg show. The securities are based on the\nsame-maturity OFZs yielding 5.8 percent.  Banks sold a total of 12 ruble-denominated structured\nnotes, also known as credit-linked notes or CLNs, led by London-\nbased Barclays with four deals totaling 3.8 billion rubles, the\ndata for this year show. Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank has sold\nthree of the securities totaling 1.5 billion rubles, JPMorgan,\nbased in New York, raised 1 billion rubles from three deals and\nING Groep NV sold two notes at 590 million rubles. Banks last\nyear sold seven structured notes.  Investor Confidence  Issuance is picking up as investor confidence improves\nafter Russia\u2019s record 7.9 percent economic contraction last\nyear. The economy will grow by 3.9 to 4.5 percent each of the\nnext three years, Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said on\nOct. 6 in Moscow. The recovery is being spurred by an increase\nin the price of oil, Russia\u2019s main export, which traded above\n$80 a barrel through October.  The ruble will strengthen 6.9 percent against the central\nbank\u2019s target currency basket of dollars and euros by the end of\nnext year, according to the median of five forecasts on\nBloomberg. Non-deliverable forwards, or NDFs, which provide a\nguide to expectations of currency movements and interest rate\ndifferentials and allow companies to hedge against currency\nmovements, show the ruble at 30.3933 per dollar in three months.  Brokerage Agreement  The ruble, which depreciated to a low of 31.8 per dollar in\nJune, has climbed 0.3 percent this year, underperforming the\nBrazilian real\u2019s 4.9 percent gain and the South African rand\u2019s\n8.5 percent rally. It slid 0.4 percent today to 30.19 per dollar\nby 1:42 p.m. in Moscow.  \u201cThe Russian CLN business goes in waves,\u201d said  Edward Franklin , an emerging-markets credit trader at JPMorgan in\nLondon. \u201cThe local currency weakened a bit from July onwards\nand I think once it broke through 31 against the dollar people\nstarted to think about adding CLNs again.\u201d  Investors in structured debt avoid the need to set up an\nagreement with a local brokerage, which is a requirement for\nbuying ruble bonds.  \u201cThe logic behind the existence of credit-linked notes is\nto allow offshore investors to gain access to borrowers in major\njurisdictions,\u201d Igor Zelezetskii, a structured finance analyst\nat Moody\u2019s Investor Service in London, said in a phone\ninterview. \u201cBanks acting as intermediaries in the market\nusually have lending and legal expertise in the country.\u201d  \u2018Wouldn\u2019t Touch\u2019  Bank Julius Baer & Co., the 120-year-old Swiss private\nbank, and Aviva Investors, the U.K.\u2019s second-biggest insurer,\nare keeping out of ruble-denominated structured debt.  \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t touch Russia here,\u201d  Thomas Maurer , a trader\nof fixed-income structured products at Bank Julius Baer said in\na phone interview from his office in Zurich. \u201cMaybe the only\nreason you would buy these CLNs is if you can\u2019t find enough\nbonds to buy.\u201d  Buyers of structured debt don\u2019t receive the registration\ndocuments that allow holders of regular bonds to exercise legal\nrights in the case of default, according to Maurer. Buyers can\ntypically only trade structured notes with the issuing bank,\ncreating the risk they won\u2019t be able to sell the notes when they\nwant to, Maurer said.  \u201cThe liquidity is often very questionable and the exit of\nthe trade if it\u2019s structured may only be with the counter party,\nthe one with whom you do the deal,\u201d said  Jeremy Brewin , who\nmanages $2.4 billion of emerging-market assets for Aviva in\nLondon. \u201cStructured notes are not a solution unless it\u2019s\nextremely difficult to get access to the market and in the case\nof Russia it isn\u2019t.\u201d  Indonesia, Ukraine  In Indonesia, where investors are required to hold domestic\nbonds for at least a month, structured debt sales have tripled\nto $1.8 billion this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nIssuance linked to Ukraine\u2019s debt is almost four times higher\nthan Russia at $948 million.  Russia \u201ccould be a much larger market,\u201d McCarthy at\nValartis said. Issuance may rise as the government plans to\nincrease bond sales, providing a greater pool of securities to\npackage into credit-linked notes, he said.  The Finance Ministry is targeting a record 1.3 trillion\nrubles of bond sales next year to fund a budget deficit it says\nwill reach 3.6 percent of gross domestic product.  The government\u2019s ruble bonds due in August 2016 fell today,\npushing the yield up one basis point to 7.09 percent. The yield\non Russia\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2020 dropped two basis points to\n4.158 percent.  Extra Yield  The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian debt\nrather than U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 198, according to\nJPMorgan EMBI+ Indexes. The difference compares with 140 for\ndebt of similarly rated Mexico and 176 for Brazil, which is\nrated two steps lower than Russia\u2019s Baa1 ranking at Moody\u2019s.  The so-called  yield   spread  on Russian bonds is 51 basis\npoints below the average for emerging markets, down from a 15-\nmonth high of 105 in February, according to JPMorgan indexes.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for\nfive years using credit-default swaps declined 0.5 basis point\nto 133 today, down from this year\u2019s peak of 217, according to\ndata provider CMA. The contracts pay the buyer face value in\nexchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent\nshould a government or company fail to adhere to its debt\nagreements.  Credit-default swaps for Russia cost one basis point more\nthan contracts for Turkey, which is rated four levels lower at\nBa2. Russia swaps  cost  as much as 40 basis points less on April\n20.  Fees Climb  Banks are charging more for selling structured debt than\nthey were before the global credit crisis, when fees for five-\nyear notes dropped to 0.5 percent,  Guy Thomas , the global head\nof emerging-market credit structuring at ING Groep NV, said in a\nphone interview from London. \u201cThey\u2019ve widened considerably this\nyear,\u201d said Thomas.  Fees are as much as 60 percent lower on average than for\nEurobond underwriting, Rubenstein at IFC Metropol said.\nStructured debt sales are \u201csmaller and faster to do,\u201d he said.
