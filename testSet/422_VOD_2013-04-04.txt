The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVodafone Group Plc (VOD)  is restating its\nresults going back two fiscal years as new international\naccounting rules for joint ventures cut historical revenue and\nearnings.  Revenue for the year ended March 2012 was revised to 38.8\nbillion pounds ($58.4 billion) from 46.4 billion pounds, the\nNewbury, England-based company said today in a  statement .\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\nwere reduced to 11.6 billion pounds from 14.5 billion pounds.  Rather than taking a proportion of revenues and earnings\nfor jointly owned businesses in  Italy ,  Australia ,  India  and\nFiji, and telecommunications-tower builder and operator Indus\nTowers Ltd., and accounting for them in its income statement,\nVodafone will only take its share of the net income and put it\ninto the \u201cassociates\u201d line, Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford said in November. That method is similar to the way the\ncompany accounts for its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless,\nVodafone\u2019s U.S. mobile venture with Verizon Communications Inc.  Free cash flow for the year ended March 2012 was reduced to\n5.7 billion pounds from 6.1 billion pounds. Adjusted earnings\nper share and profit will remain the same under the new rules\nfor joint ventures.  The company is also revising how it accounts for employee\npension plans. Vodafone will replace the expected return on the\nplans\u2019 assets and interest costs, which appear in the\nconsolidated income statement for defined benefit pension plans,\nwith a net interest cost. That will change the way the charge is\ncalculated and impact the amounts recorded in the company\u2019s\nincome statement.  Vodafone will restate financial information for the 12\nmonths ending March 2013 during its results announcement in May,\nthe company said.
