Here, CNBC looks at eight developments that have helped to shape the world we live in today. 1946 \u2013 ENIAC \nDeveloped by John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, or ENIAC, was built at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. Described by the university as the \"first general-purpose electronic computer,\" ENIAC's \"operational characteristics\" included memory and arithmetic.

While IBM's PC was not the first \u2014 others had been available since the 1970s \u2014 its version became incredibly popular and for many it set the standards of what a PC should be. Costing $1,565, the IBM 5150 had 40K of read-only memory and 16K of user memory. Other features included a built-in speaker and the the ability to run self-diagnostic checks. It also made use of Microsoft's MS-DOS 1.0, a 16-bit operating system.

With Vangelis' \"Chariots of Fire\" playing in the background, the Apple co-founder showcased a number of the Macintosh's capabilities, from its ability to \"talk\" to a drawing application that was able to produce sophisticated images. Jobs had grand ambitions for the product. \"Macintosh is targeted at two primary markets. The first is the 25 million 'knowledge workers' who sit behind desks, and particularly those in medium and small-sized businesses. And the second market is the college worker, we think that's the knowledge worker of tomorrow and there are over 11 million college students in America alone.\" Apic | Hulton Archive | Getty Images 1985 \u2013 Microsoft launches Windows \nWindows 1.0 was launched to market in November 1985 as an operating system with a graphical interface. Today, the latest versions of Windows are used by millions of people worldwide. Dick Barnatt | Hulton Archive | Getty Images 1989 \u2013 The World Wide Web \nIn 1989 British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee submitted a proposal for a \"distributed information system\" at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, near Geneva, Switzerland. A year later, the world's first website and server went live at CERN. Anthony Devlin | PA Images | Getty Images 1994 \u2013 The Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation \nLaunched within weeks of each other in 1994, the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation consoles blazed a trail in the video gaming industry. While the PlayStation has outlasted the Saturn through multiple iterations, including today's PlayStation 4, both consoles had a significant impact and influence on home entertainment. Unlike the Super Nintendo, Sega Mega Drive and other similar consoles, games for the Saturn and PlayStation came on CDs rather than cartridges. The consoles had enough power inside to showcase games including the visually stunning \"Nights into Dreams\" on the Saturn and \"Final Fantasy VII,\" an in-depth role-playing game on the PlayStation.

Dial-up connections have become a relic of the past with users now accustomed to high-speed downloads, super-fast browsing, high-resolution streaming and a great deal more. In the U.K., for example, there were 25.3 million fixed broadband connections at the end of 2016, according to communications regulator Ofcom.

With the click of a button, a song being played on a computer in someone's bedroom can be beamed to and displayed on a 72-inch TV in their living room via a high speed, wireless connection. This merging of physical and virtual worlds is known as the internet of things.
