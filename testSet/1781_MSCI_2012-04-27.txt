 "context": "The following article called 'BlackRock Shifts Brazil Tack on Government Currency Moves' was published on 2012-04-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrazil\u2019s currency policies are\ndriving  BlackRock Inc. (MALTX)  to buy stocks that will benefit from a\nweaker real while  Brown Brothers  Harriman & Co. tells its\nclients the South American country is losing credibility.  Government moves aimed at depreciating the real and helping\nexporters have led to a 8.9 percent drop in the currency since\nthe end of February, the worst performance in emerging markets.\nCentral bankers signaled yesterday that they may cut borrowing\ncosts to a record low as economic growth slows, even as\ninflation remains above the mid-point of their target.  Will Landers, who manages $7 billion in Latin American\nequities at New York-based BlackRock, said he has put as much as\n5 percent of his assets in stocks of Brazilian exporters and\nother companies that will benefit when the real trades weaker\nthan 1.8 per dollar. Investor confidence in  Brazil  has\ndeteriorated to the lowest since the 1999 devaluation because of\n\u201cso many road blocks\u201d in the  currency market , said  Win Thin ,\nthe global head of emerging-markets strategy at Brown Brothers.  \u201cWe have been moving into some currency-defensive stocks\nwithin Brazil given the government\u2019s policy to keep the currency\nat a weaker rate,\u201d Landers said yesterday at the Bloomberg\nLatin America Investing Conference in New York. \u201cThis is\nsomething we hadn\u2019t done for a while.\u201d  Brazil\u2019s Bovespa has gained 9.6 percent this year, with a\n38 percent advance for Embraer SA, the planemaker that sells to\nAir France and  American Airlines . That compares with an 11\npercent advance of the MSCI Emerging Market Index. The  Brazilian\nbenchmark (IBOV)  lost 18 percent in 2011 as inflation accelerated to\nsix-year high in July.  Currency Measures  Policy makers have boosted a tax on foreign loans and\nbonds, raised the costs for companies to borrow abroad and\nlevied a tariff on currency-derivative trading to mute the real,\nwhich strengthened 61 percent in the 10 years through July 2011.\nFinance Minister  Guido Mantega  has called his country\u2019s policies\nan appropriate reaction to a global \u201ccurrency war\u201d as the\nU.S.,  Japan  and  Europe  keep interest rates close to zero.  Mantega said April 3 that a real at 1.80 per dollar would\nbe \u201creasonable,\u201d fueling speculation the government is setting\na target instead of allowing for a free-floating currency. The\nreal fell 0.3 percent yesterday to 1.8856 per dollar.  \u201cThe level of frustration I sense among investors and\nmarkets with Brazil is perhaps the worst I\u2019ve seen in a good 10\nyears,\u201d said Thin, who worked at Alliance Capital Management\nfrom 1997 to 1999 before joining Mandalay Advisors from 2000 to\n2007. \u201cOver the last year or so they squandered\u201d some of the\ncredibility policy makers built up in the past decade, Thin\nsaid.  Real Forecast  Bank of America Corp. cut its year-end forecast for the\nreal on April 24, citing officials\u2019 efforts to depreciate the\ncurrency. The real will drop to 1.92 by year-end and decline to\n1.95 by 2013, compared with the previous forecast of 1.85 and\n1.92 for the two periods, strategists led by  David Beker  wrote\nin a note. The median forecast of 23 analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg is for the real to rise to 1.8 per dollar by Dec. 31.  The central bank\u2019s  interest-rate  cuts are making Brazilian\nstocks more attractive, according to Audrey Kaplan, a  money\nmanager  at Federated Investors Inc. She said she has boosted the\nportion of Brazilian stocks in her portfolio to 9.5 percent,\nfrom zero in 2011, as the central bank lowered its benchmark\ninterest rate 3.5 percentage points since August to 9 percent.  \u201cThe environment is more favorable because interest rates\nare going down,\u201d Kaplan said at the conference. \u201cOur biggest\nconcern is the strength of the currency.\u201d  Surprise Cuts  The central bank, led by Alexandre Tombini, said that any\nfurther reductions should be \u201cconducted with parsimony\u201d as\nrates approach the record low of 8.75 percent, according to the\nminutes of its April 17-18 meeting, released yesterday.  Since taking office 16 months ago, Tombini set interest\nrates lower than economists estimated in three out of 10 policy\nmeetings. No central banker in the world\u2019s top 10 economies has\nsurprised analysts more often, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg, raising concern that Brazil\u2019s policies are becoming\ntoo unpredictable.  Lower interest rates risk fanning inflation. Consumer\nprices rose 5.2 percent in March from a year earlier, exceeding\nthe mid-point of the central bank\u2019s target of 4.5 percent plus\nor minus two percentage points.  Marcela Meirelles, a Latin America strategist at TCW Corp\nInc., which oversees $128 billion of assets, said Brazil\u2019s\ncurrency policy helps smooth the real\u2019s swings. Policy makers in\n emerging markets  are justified in adopting unconventional\nmeasures to cope with an influx of capital to avoid currency\novervaluation and instability in the financial system, as\ninterest rates in advanced economies stay low, she said.  Avoiding Volatility  \u201cI am sort of in a way sympathetic to the concerns policy\nmakers have,\u201d Meirelles said at the Bloomberg conference\nyesterday. \u201cI don\u2019t think volatility is something that we would\nwelcome.\u201d  Instead of intervening in the currency market, policy\nmakers should make reforms to help improve the competitiveness\nof companies to cope with a stronger real, said Landers.  \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, because what they should be doing is\nnot focusing on the currency side, but really focusing on\nimproving the costs of doing business in Brazil so these\ncompanies could be more competitive,\u201d said Landers.  Investment in Brazil was 20 percent of gross domestic\nproduct in 2011, about the same as in 1980, compared with 38\npercent for  India  and 49 percent for  China , according to the\n International Monetary Fund . It\u2019s easier to do business in\nPakistan or Albania than in Brazil, according to the  World\nBank \u2019s 2012 competitiveness study, which ranked the nation No.\n126 out of 183 countries.  The real is \u201cway too strong,\u201d and will remain\n\u201cmisaligned\u201d for a while,  Alberto Ramos , chief Latin America\neconomist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said at the conference.\nPolicy makers should foster industries in which Brazil enjoys a\ncompetitive advantage, including mining and agriculture, rather\nthan orchestrating a weaker currency, he said.  \u201cThe biggest pitfall is that policy responses have been\ntoo concentrated on the short-term dynamics,\u201d Ramos said.
