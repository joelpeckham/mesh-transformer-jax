 "context": "The following article called 'Pemex Sees Benefit in Argentina Shale Partnership, Director Says' was published on 2013-09-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPetroleos Mexicanos , the world\u2019s\nfifth-largest crude producer, would consider an offer to partner\nwith  YPF SA (YPF)  in developing shale projects in  Argentina , said a\ndirector of the state-run company known as Pemex.  A joint venture with YPF, the company that Argentina \nexpropriated from Spain\u2019s  Repsol SA (REP)  last year, would give Pemex\nexperience in shale oil and gas fields and generate foreign \ninvestment for Argentina, Fluvio Ruiz said today at a conference\nin Buenos Aires.  \u201cWe just need to receive an offer and we would decide in a\nfew months if there was an appealing formal offer tendered,\u201d\nthe Pemex board member told the conference.  YPF Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio, seeking\npartners to help finance projects that would revert declining\noutput, said Sept. 1 he is willing to form a partnership with\nPemex to develop deposits in the Vaca Muerta shale formation.\nWhile the two companies have held informal talks, Pemex\u2019s board\nwould need a formal offer from YPF to analyze, Ruiz said.  After the nationalized YPF sealed its first shale accord\nwith  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  on July 16, Galuccio said Argentina needs\nmore investors like the  San Ramon , California-based company to\nstop a production decline that contributed to the biggest plunge\nin central reserves since 2002.  YPF  American depositary receipts  rose 1.8 percent to $17.89\nat 12:01 p.m. in  New York , the highest level since April 16,\n2012, the day President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  announced\nthe nationalization. Chevron gained 0.4 percent to $121.83,\nwhile Repsol added 0.7 percent in Madrid.  Repsol Opposition  Pemex is a minority shareholder in Repsol, which is\nlobbying against prospective Vaca Muerta partnerships. The\nMadrid-based producer rejected on June 25 an expropriation\ncompensation offer that included a 47 percent stake in a Vaca\nMuerta project valued by Argentina at $3.5 billion, as well as\n$1.5 billion for development, according to a regulatory filing.  Repsol has filed lawsuits in Madrid and New York seeking\n$10.5 billion in compensation for the seizure.  \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with Repsol\u2019s approach to potential YPF\ndeals and regarding this particular potential JV as state-owned\ncompanies have their right to discuss their energy policies,\u201d\nRuiz said. \u201cI hope they don\u2019t react by opposing once we receive\na formal offer from YPF.\u201d  Kristian Rix, a Repsol spokesman in Madrid, declined to\ncomment on Ruiz\u2019s comments regarding Repsol\u2019s approach to \npotential YPF partnerships.   Repsol filed a request in July to the International Center\nfor Settlement of Investment Disputes, asking the arbitrator to\ninstruct Argentina to abstain from developing strategic YPF \nassets seized from the Spanish oil producer.
