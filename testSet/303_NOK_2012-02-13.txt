 "context": "The following article called 'BMW Profit Drive Ends in Court as Union Seeks Cap on Temps: Cars' was published on 2012-02-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  is\ntaking its drive for record output to court after labor\nrepresentatives opposed hiring more temporary employees, in a\nrare clash between the carmaker\u2019s management and the shop floor.  The world\u2019s largest maker of luxury cars employs about\n1,100 workers without longer-term contracts at its Leipzig\nfactory in eastern  Germany , or almost 30 percent of the total.\nLabor representatives refused to support a new round of\ntemporary contracts, saying the practice creates a two-tier\nsystem of employees. A first court hearing on the issue is\nscheduled for tomorrow.  \u201cIt\u2019s clearly unusual for BMW to have such an argument in\npublic,\u201d said  Juergen Pieper , a Bankhaus Metzler analyst in\nFrankfurt. \u201cBMW wants to protect its well-paid core staff, and\nthe last crisis showed the importance of flexibility.\u201d  The confrontation underscores German companies\u2019 push to\nmake their workforce more nimble, in a country where rigid labor\nlaws make hiring and firing protracted processes. Munich-based\nBMW  aims  to sell more than 2 million vehicles by 2020 from a\nrecord 1.67 million last year, as it seeks to maintain its lead\nover domestic rivals  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) \u2019s Audi unit.  Jochen Mueller, a spokesman for BMW in Leipzig, said\ntemporary workers are paid the same base salaries as long-term\nemployees, and the mix gives the carmaker more flexibility.\nJochen Frey, another BMW spokesman, said permanent staff last\nyear got a bonus worth close to a month\u2019s salary, which temps\ndid not get. He said that bonus varies with corporate profit.  Permission Denied  The Leipzig factory assembles the  1-Series  and X1 sport-\nutility vehicle and produced 186,800 units in 2010. BMW gave\nabout 170 temporary workers in Leipzig permanent contracts in\n2011 because of strong demand, and the company is spending 400\nmillion euros ($529 million) to expand the facility.  BMW plans to hire another 350 people permanently at the\nfactory this year and welcomes applications from current temps,\nMueller said.  German companies with more than 20 workers require approval\nfrom employee representatives when hiring. Should the court in\nLeipzig side with the employees\u2019 decision to refuse backing the\nhiring, BMW will need to consider \u201calternatives,\u201d Frey said,\nwithout elaborating.  Employing temporary workers can help lower labor costs,\nwhich stood at 43.76 euros per hour in 2010 in the automotive\nindustry, according to data from Germany\u2019s VDA carmakers\u2019\nassociation. That\u2019s 58 percent higher than in the U.S., and\nalmost six times higher than in neighboring  Poland . BMW had\n11,000 subcontracted employees among its 100,389 workers as of\nSept. 30.  Around the Corner  \u201cThey tell us the next crisis is just around the corner,\nso they need temps in order to be able to cut staff quickly and\ncheaply,\u201d Jens Koehler, who heads the works council at BMW\u2019s\nLeipzig plant, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d  In the economic downturn after 2008, German companies\nresponded with shortened workweeks, which was credited with\navoiding major layoffs and helping kick-start production once\ndemand rebounded.  Daimler (DAI)  reduced hours of about 120,000 people,\nalmost its entire German workforce.  Airbus SAS said Feb. 13 that it will cap the use of\ncontract workers at 20 percent starting this year, and that 300\npeople from that pool will have the option of taking full-time\nemployment. German labor law stipulates that temporary\nemployment must be transient, while there is no definition for a\nmaximum time period. Some  BMW (BMW)  employees have been temps at the\ncarmaker for years, the union said.  Temporary workers are more flexible because they are\nemployed by an agency and can be removed when demand slackens.\nThe workers often don\u2019t get additional compensation for night\nshifts, Christmas and vacation pay or one-time bonuses,\naccording to the IG Metall metalworkers union, which represents\nlarge parts of Germany\u2019s manufacturing workers, including those\nworking at automakers.  \u2018Had It\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019ve had it up to here with temps; we\u2019ve been\ndeceived,\u201d said IG Metall Chairman Berthold Huber. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nhappening is shameful and abusive, and we\u2019ll no longer tolerate\nit.\u201d  BMW has historically maintained a cooperative relationship\nwith its workforce, stemming from the company\u2019s rescue from near\ncollapse in 1959. At the time, union officials played a key role\nin encouraging Herbert Quandt, whose descendants still control\nthe carmaker, to thwart a takeover from Daimler-Benz.  Workers have more clout in Germany than in other countries\nbecause they are represented in the highest echelons of company\nmanagement. Every supervisory board of publicly traded companies\nis evenly split between representatives for management and\nemployees.  That system, unique to Germany, gives works councils and\nunion members more sway over strategy, hiring and firing, as\nwell as pay of senior executives. Huber sits on supervisory\nboards including  Volkswagen (VOW3) , Audi and  Siemens AG (SIE) , Germany\u2019s\nlargest engineering company.  Falling Unemployment  Germany\u2019s car industry has rebounded from the crisis years.\nDaimler exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates last week with its profit\ntarget for 2012, propelled by record demand for Mercedes-Benz\nbrand cars. Chief Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  has vowed to\nretake the luxury-car lead from BMW after slipping last year to\nthird behind Audi. BMW reports earnings on March 13, a day after\nVolkswagen.  The car industry accounts for about 15 percent of Germany\u2019s\n gross domestic product . Germany\u2019s VDMA machinery industry\nassociation, which represents the country\u2019s largest\nmanufacturing segment, estimates the ratio of subcontracted\nworkers on manufacturers\u2019 payrolls stands at 6 percent, twice\nthe amount in 2005.  With  unemployment  at a two-decade low and employment\nnumbers hitting records, the number of subcontracted workers in\nGermany swelled to about 930,000 last year,  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the\nworld\u2019s largest staffing company, estimates.  Subdued Demand  German executives at companies including Siemens have\ncautioned of subdued demand in 2012 as  Europe  continues to\ngrapple with the fallout from the sovereign debt crisis that is\nweighing on consumer sentiment. Siemens predicted last month\nthat the region may enter a recession.  Plant and machinery orders in Europe\u2019s largest economy\ndropped 12 percent in November, the first annual decline in\nalmost two years, and slid 10 percent in December, VDMA said.\nCompanies including Siemens,  Nokia (NOK1V)  Siemens Networks, and\n Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG (HDD)  have announced thousands of job\ncuts in Germany in recent weeks.  Each time a company cuts jobs, temporary workers are\ntypically among the first to go, said IG Metall Vice Chairman\nDetlef Wetzel.  \u201cWhen the crisis hits, the number of temps will\ndrastically be reduced,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir assignments will\nsimply be canceled.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Richard Weiss  in  Frankfurt  at \n rweiss5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nBenedikt Kammel at \n bkammel@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Nokia Corporation was 3.6518304347991943 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Nokia Corporation was ",
