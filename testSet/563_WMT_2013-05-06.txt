The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBangladesh \u2019s government, workers,\nemployers and the International Labour Organization agreed to a\nplan to improve employee rights and safety after more than 600\npeople were killed in a factory building collapse last month.  The ILO proposals, which include better worker protection\nand the right to collective bargaining, will be submitted to\nparliament during its next session, expected to start in June,\nthe Geneva-based organization said in a  statement  on its\nwebsite. The government will cooperate in the implementation of\nthe plan, Commerce Secretary Mahbub Ahmed said by phone\nyesterday.  \u201cThe initiative is a turning point in Bangladesh\u2019s\nhistory,\u201d Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque said May 4 at a\npress briefing in Dhaka where the ILO proposals were released.\n\u201cThere is a convergence of interests for bringing about a\nchange in the industry.\u201d  The agreement on steps to improve worker conditions comes\nafter a building housing garment factories collapsed on April 24\nin Bangladesh\u2019s worst industrial disaster. The 27-nation\nEuropean Union is considering trade sanctions against the\ncountry, and months before the incident, the U.S. government\nsaid it may revoke the nation\u2019s preferred trade status over\ntreatment of workers.  \u201cThe only way forward is fast implementation of promises\nthe government and owners have made,\u201d said Kalpona Akter,\nexecutive director of the Bangladesh Center for Worker\nSolidarity, an organization that promotes labor rights. \u201cNo\nmore of talking. No more of saying it\u2019s high time to do this and\nthat.\u201d  Death Toll  The death toll from the collapsed Rana Plaza building has\nclimbed to 660 as the army continues to clear out debris.  The ILO and its partners will \u201cassess by the end of 2013\nthe structural building safety and fire safety of all active\nexport-oriented ready-made garment factories in Bangladesh, and\ninitiate remedial actions, including relocation of unsafe\nfactories,\u201d it said.  Bangladesh\u2019s government, employers and workers have asked\nthe ILO to start a training program for those injured in the\nbuilding collapse, the organization said in the statement on May\n4. The government will recruit 200 additional building\ninspectors within six months, with the budget to be increased\nfor a minimum of 800 inspectors.  Deadly Fire  The Rana Plaza building collapse came after at least 112\npeople were killed in November in a fire at the Tazreen garment\nfactory that was producing clothes for companies including  Wal-\nMart Stores Inc. (WMT)  Another deadly blaze in 2006 left 54 people\ndead at KTS Textile and Garments in the port city of Chittagong.  \u201cJust after the Tazreen fire, the government and the\nowners made a lot of promises -- factory inspection and safety\nfor workers,\u201d Akter said. \u201cWithin five months, the disaster\nstruck again.\u201d  As wages have risen in  China , companies such as  Li & Fung\nLtd. (494) , the world\u2019s largest supplier of clothes and toys to\nretailers, are tapping Bangladesh and other lower-cost Asian\ncountries.  Textiles contribute more than 10 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s\ngross domestic product and about 80 percent of the nation\u2019s\nexports, mainly to the U.S. and the European Union, according to\nBangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association.  International Pressure  European Union Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht called for\n\u201cimmediate\u201d action by the Bangladesh government to improve\nhealth and safety conditions in the garment industry. In the\nabsence of any steps, the commission will be ready to start an\ninvestigation that may lead to the suspension of the country\u2019s\ntrade status with the EU, he said on RTBF radio.  The U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office said in a Jan. 8\nnotice in the Federal Register that \u201cthe lack of progress by\nthe government of Bangladesh in addressing worker rights issues\nin the country warrants consideration of possible withdrawal,\nsuspension or limitation of Bangladesh\u2019s trade benefits.\u201d  Retailers including Wal-Mart and  J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  and labor\nactivists have been considering an agreement to improve factory\nsafety in Bangladesh for at least two years.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ,\nthe world\u2019s largest entertainment company, which has partners in\nvarious countries that make clothing and merchandise, decided in\nMarch to pull out of the country.
