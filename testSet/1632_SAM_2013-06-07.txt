The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNaoyuki Ide is betting that a  weaker\nyen  will drive more Japanese people to drink his locally made\ncraft beers.  The president of  Yo-Ho Brewing Co.  is boosting production\ncapacity at the microbrewery in Nagano, central  Japan , by 50\npercent this year as he anticipates the currency\u2019s decline will\nforce importers to raise prices for foreign brands, giving local\ncraft brewers such as his a competitive edge.  \u201cIf the yen weakens more, they\u2019ll have to increase import\nbeer prices in the near future,\u201d Ide, whose company makes Yona\nYona Ale and Tokyo Black beer, said in an interview. \u201cImport\nbeers cater to people\u2019s growing taste for beer with character,\nbut if customers are looking for something distinct, they may\nchoose our beer instead, because it\u2019ll be cheaper.\u201d  The weaker yen and an increase in  consumer spending  may\nstoke a Japanese craft-brewing boom that was already bucking a\ndecline in total beer sales before Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\nbegan a campaign to stimulate the economy and end deflation.\nShipments of domestic craft beer rose 7.7 percent in the first\neight months of 2012 from a year earlier, according to Tokyo\nShoko Research, while sales at Japan\u2019s biggest breweries fell.  Domestic shipments by the nation\u2019s five largest beermakers,\nincluding  Sapporo Holdings Ltd. (2501) ,  Kirin Holdings Co. (2503)  and  Asahi\nGroup Holdings Ltd. (2502) , dropped to a record low for the eight\nstraight year in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  $60 Beer  A can of Yo-Ho\u2019s Yona Yona Ale costs from 220 yen ($2.22)\non Rakuten, the biggest Japanese Internet retail site, compared\nwith 187 yen for Asahi\u2019s flagship Super Dry brand.  Diageo Plc (DGE) \u2019s\nGuinness Extra Stout costs from 270 yen and a Samuel Adams\nBoston Lager from the  Boston Beer Co. (SAM)  starts at 345 yen.  At  Craftheads , a bar in Tokyo\u2019s Shibuya district, prices\nrange from 500 yen for a 200-ml (6.8 ounce) glass of Shiga Kogen\nAfrica Pale Ale to 6,000 yen for a limited-edition 650-ml bottle\nof  Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout , brewed in Munster,  Indiana .  Japanese consumers are also drinking more American\nmicrobrews. The Asian nation\u2019s imports of U.S. craft beer soared\n57 percent in 2012, according to the Boulder, Colorado-based\n Brewers Association , a trade group of small U.S. beermakers.  \u201cDemand seems to be expanding all over the place,\u201d said\nScott Brimmer, the brewmaster at Kawasaki, Japan-based  Brimmer\nBrewing K.K. , which opened in 2011. \u201cWe\u2019re in the right place\nat the right time.\u201d  Rising Consumption  The yen has dropped about 15 percent against the U.S.\ndollar in the past six months as Abe and Bank of Japan chief\nHaruhiko Kuroda try to lift the country out of an economic slump\nby monetary easing. The currency traded at 96.68 yen per dollar\nas of 4:22 p.m. in  Tokyo .  The nation\u2019s gross domestic product rose an annualized 3.5\npercent in the first quarter of 2012, the most in a year, with\ngrowth in private consumption contributing 2.3 percentage\npoints.  Import beer volume fell to 40.7 million liters in 2012 from\n42.4 million liters in 2011, while on a monetary basis imports\nrose to 5.49 billion yen from 5.41 billion yen, according to\ngovernment statistics. Prices for imported beer haven\u2019t risen\nyet, suggesting retailers are absorbing the weaker yen through\nlower margins, Ide said.  Sales at Yo-Ho surged 40 percent in the year ended Nov. 30,\nand the company plans to double sales this year, Ide said. Set\nup as a subsidiary of Hoshino Resort Co. in 1996, Yo-Ho is the\nlargest craft brewer in Japan, he said.  \u201cDemand is a lot more than we expected,\u201d Ide said,\ndeclining to specify the amount of sales or production volume.  While a weaker yen may raise the price of imported\ningredients, material costs account for less than 10 percent of\nretail prices in the industry, Ide said. For Yo-Ho, the\npercentage is dropping as sales volume rises, he said.  \u2018Boom in Japan\u2019  A loosening of regulations in 1994 that lowered the minimum\nproduction level for beermakers opened the doors to\nmicrobreweries in Japan, according to the  Japan Brewers\nAssociation . After an initial surge in new breweries, the number\nfell to about 200 now from a peak of about 300, Ide said.  Many of the early microbreweries lacked sufficient quality\nto stay in business, Brimmer said. The industry has begun to\npick up again in recent years as those who stuck with craft\nbrewing gradually raised the quality of their products, he said.  \u201cThis is the second microbrew boom in Japan,\u201d said Joji\nUehara, a researcher at Tokyo Shoko Research.  Craft beers still make up less than 1 percent of Japan\u2019s\ndomestic beer market, estimated Ry Beville, publisher of the\nYokohama-based Japan Beer Times, a bilingual publication\ndedicated to microbrews. By comparison, they accounted for 6.5\npercent of the  U.S. beer  market by volume and 10 percent by\nsales last year, according to the Brewers Association.  High taxes and the need to import many ingredients make\ncraft brewing expensive in Japan, Beville said. Demand has\nnonetheless been rising, even amid lackluster  economic growth .  More Microbrews  \u201cPeople simply want choice,\u201d Beville said. \u201cIf they\u2019re\nonly going to be able to afford a couple of drinks, they want to\nmake it worth their while.\u201d  The slow economy has prompted some bars and pubs to start\noffering more microbrews to stand out from their competitors,\nTokyo Shoko\u2019s Uehara said.  For some patrons, like Junya Yoshida, a 30-year-old office\nworker at an advertising company, the craft brews are an\nexpensive treat.  \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of a luxury,\u201d said Yoshida, who\nordered an Imperial Red Ale from Niigata, Japan-based Swan Lake\nBeer recently at Craftheads, a craft brew and bourbon bar that\noffers about 100 bottled beers and about 20 on tap. \u201cI like\nbeer with rich taste, so I want to drink craft beer even if it\u2019s\njust once a week.\u201d  Yoshida paid 600 yen for his 200-ml glass of ale, or about\nsix times the price of Sapporo\u2019s Mugi to Hop, his usual drink at\nhome.  Wide Selection  In the U.S., the growing popularity of microbrews has led\nlarge beermakers to acquire some smaller breweries. Japan\u2019s\nlarge breweries aren\u2019t jumping on the bandwagon quite yet.  \u201cWe\u2019re not considering it,\u201d said Masaya Hayashida, a\ngeneral manager in the marketing department at Tokyo-based\nKirin. \u201cWe can offer our customers different options on our\nown.\u201d  Large Japanese brewers may show interest in acquiring\nmicrobreweries as they see craft beers continue to gain in\npopularity, Brimmer said.  \u201cProbably one of the companies would try to test the\nwaters a little bit and see if anyone is willing to sell out,\u201d\nBrimmer said.  Like Yo-Ho, Brimmer\u2019s is expanding to meet the growing\ndemand. The company plans to triple the capacity of its tanks\nthis year, he said.  \u201cPeople from all generations are finally understanding and\nenjoying the different styles of beer out there,\u201d Brimmer said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nYuki Yamaguchi in Tokyo at \n yyamaguchi10@bloomberg.net ;\nTerje Langeland in Tokyo at \n tlangeland1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTeo Chian Wei at \n cwteo@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Boston Beer Company, Inc.
