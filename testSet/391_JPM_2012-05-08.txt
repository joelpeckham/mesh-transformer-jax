(FB)  officials are touting\ngrowth prospects for the largest social network in meetings this\nweek in  New York  and  Boston  with hundreds of would-be investors\nbefore its record initial public offering.  Chief Operating Officer  Sheryl Sandberg  and Chief Financial\nOfficer David Ebersman led a presentation in Boston today. They\nwere joined yesterday in New York by Chief Executive Officer\n Mark Zuckerberg . The executives discussed reasons for acquiring\nphoto-sharing site Instagram and told investors they were\noptimistic about potential for future gains.  Facebook plans to raise as much as $11.8 billion in its\nIPO, the biggest ever for an  Internet company . Zuckerberg, 27,\nhas had to pitch his business model during Facebook\u2019s years as a\nprivate company and probably won\u2019t have trouble communicating\nthe mission to prospective public investors, said  Herman Leung ,\nan analyst at Susquehanna International Group.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to hear directly from him for investors\nwho are about to put millions and millions of dollars into a\ncompany,\u201d said Leung, who is based in  San Francisco .\n\u201cConvincing others now they should buy shouldn\u2019t be that hard\nfor a company that has amassed a user base of over 900\nmillion.\u201d  \u2018Value-Creation Story\u2019  In New York, potential investors waited in a line that\nsnaked through the Sheraton New York Hotel lobby and around the\nside of the building for a meeting that started about an hour\nlate. CNBC televised footage of a hooded sweatshirt-clad\nZuckerberg arriving at the hotel.  \u201cThe questions were all toward long-term elements of the\nbusiness,\u201d said Samuel Schwerin, managing partner at New York-\nbased Millennium Technology Value Partners, which oversees $1\nbillion, including Facebook stock it bought in 2008. Schwerin\nattended the meeting yesterday, and said he\u2019ll add more shares\nin the IPO. \u201cOne of the things I was surprised by was the level\nof interest in the fundamental elements of how the company grows\nand how early it is in the value-creation story for Facebook.\u201d  Attendees also watched a video featuring pitches by\nZuckerberg, Sandberg and Ebersman that had been posted online\nlast week. Facebook has arranged a meeting in  Palo Alto ,\n California , for the end of the week.  Executives addressed Facebook\u2019s slowdown in revenue growth,\nsaying the company is now facing a larger base of users and is\nworking to be useful to them and advertisers, according to\nmeeting attendees. Facebook is working on new ways to make money\nfrom mobile users, and on getting partners besides game maker\nZynga Inc. to use its platform and currency, which is used to\nbuy so-called virtual goods.  Instagram Deal  Zuckerberg, in New York, told investors that the $1 billion\nInstagram acquisition, announced last month, was contemplated\nover a long period. He said he had watched the company grow for\na while and opportunities like Instagram are unique, according\nto several meeting attendees.  The  Menlo Park , California-based company is seeking a\nmarket value of as much as $96 billion. Facebook is offering\n337.4 million shares at $28 to $35 each, and is scheduled to\nprice the offering on May 17, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\nThe shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the\nsymbol FB. Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Goldman\nSachs Group Inc. (GS)  are leading the sale.  Facebook is offering 180 million shares, while existing\nowners such as  Accel Partners , Goldman Sachs and Digital Sky\nTechnologies are offering 157.4 million shares. Zuckerberg is\noffering 30.2 million of his 533.8 million shares, and may\ncontrol about 57 percent of the voting power of Facebook\u2019s\ncapital stock outstanding after the offering, the filing shows.  Attendance Required  \u201cHis attendance might demonstrate that the company\nprocessed the message that Mark\u2019s absolute voting control makes\nhis presence, at least at some of the larger meetings,\u00a0much more\nimportant than would otherwise be the case,\u201d  Lise Buyer ,\nprincipal at Class V Group in Portola Valley, California, said\nin an e-mailed statement. \u201cThe company\u2019s job -- Mark, Sheryl,\nDavid together -- is to convince investors that Facebook\u2019s\nbrightest days are ahead and that therefore, there is\nsignificant room for an increase in the company\u2019s value.\u201d  Sandberg, who isn\u2019t selling in the IPO, holds 1.9 million\nshares.  The initial share sale would eclipse the 2004 IPO of  Google\nInc. (GOOG) , the world\u2019s most valuable Internet company. Google\u2019s\noffering, the same year Zuckerberg helped found Facebook, raised\n$1.9 billion and valued the company then at about $23 billion.
