 "context": "The following article called 'Roosevelt, Morgan Backed Indian Epic Now Going for $1.8 Million' was published on 2012-10-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPhotographer Edward Curtis (1868-\n1952) built sandcastles with Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s kids, challenged\nJ.P. Morgan in his den and worked as second cameraman on \u201cThe\nTen Commandments.\u201d  All that was small beer compared with \u201cThe North American\nIndian,\u201d his 20-volume photographic and written record of what\nthen was a rapidly declining culture. Yet he died 60 years ago\nforgotten by all but a few.  In \u201c Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher ,\u201d Timothy Egan\ntraces the remarkable arc of a poor boy in the Pacific northwest\nwho developed an uncommon talent for shooting people with a\ncamera.  Already on his way to becoming the \u201cpremier portrait\nphotographer in the U.S.,\u201d Curtis also had been shooting nature\nand Indians around  Seattle  in his mid-20s when a chance meeting\nchanged his life. He rescued a party of climbers on Mount Rainer\nand made a strong impression on two famous men among them.  Through C. Hart Merriam, cofounder of the National\nGeographic Society, Curtis got invited to be official\nphotographer on a scientific expedition to  Alaska . George Bird\nGrinnell, founder of the Audubon Society and an expert on Plains\nIndians, also made the Alaska trip and conveyed to Curtis \u201ca\nsense of urgency about the passing of so much that was original\nto the continent.\u201d  On a subsequent trip, to the Blackfeet Nation in  Montana ,\nGrinnell pushed Curtis to consider making a book from the many\nIndian photos he was taking, and so arose \u201ca plan to photograph\nall intact Indian communities left in North America.\u201d  Pulitzer Prize  Egan, a Seattle native, shared in a Pulitzer Prize for a\n New York Times (NYT)  series on race and won a National Book Award for\nhis Dust Bowl history, \u201c The Worst Hard Time \u201d (2006). That book\nand others he has written about the western U.S. show how\nattuned he is to large-scale loss.  He describes how millions of acres of prairie grass that\nanchored the soil of the High Plains was plowed up to plant\ngrain, and how drought turned the exposed soil to dust that rose\nin huge storm clouds reaching as far east as New York while many\nbroken farmers fled west in search of new land. He tells much of\nthis by finding decades later several plains families, still\nliving witnesses who had held on.  In \u201c The Big Burn \u201d (2009), Egan reveals the small and\nlarge players who fought the biggest forest fire ever to hit the\nU.S. or used it to argue for conservation.  1910 Inferno  The opening chapter mesmerizes with a 1910 town\u2019s view of\nan inferno, starting from an opening line better than most\nnovels offer: \u201cHere now came the fire down from the Bitterroot\nMountains and showered embers and forest shrapnel onto the town\nthat was supposed to be protected by all those men with faraway\naccents and empty stomachs.\u201d  Both books are remarkable pieces of journalism and suggest\nwhy Egan would appreciate the efforts Curtis expended to give\nshape and voice to the remnants of another beleaguered group.  In photographing, researching and writing his first two\nvolumes -- the text included language, rituals, customs, music\nand more -- Curtis soaked up most of the money his portrait\nstudio generated and spent years away from home. Even when\nMorgan agreed to bankroll the project -- a scene Egan recreates\nwith persuasive sharpness -- Curtis continued to take only\nexpense money, no salary.  Midway through the project, he was \u201cfacing bankruptcy and\na failed marriage,\u201d while his debts exceeded $50,000 and \u201che\nhad less than $150 in the bank.\u201d He pushed on, and after 33\nyears, the completed 20 volumes \u201ccontained more than 2,200\noriginal pictures, almost 4,000 pages of text, including\ntranscriptions of hundreds of songs and dozens of languages.\u201d  1929 Crash  The monumental task was completed shortly after the 1929\nstock crash. The country\u2019s attention was elsewhere. Egan writes:\n\u201cWhen the final volume of the Indian work had been printed in\n1930, Curtis faced the only thing worse than a bad review:\nsilence.\u201d  I emphasize the trials Curtis endured partly to highlight\nthe man\u2019s persistence. Egan\u2019s book is also a catalog of joyous\ndiscovery as Curtis, with his charm and bribes, broke down\nreluctance and recorded not just the uncommon faces and sites\nhis lens captured -- and the Egan book includes many exquisite\nCurtis photos -- but much about Indian life the tribes had never\nrevealed.  And the beauty of the West: Captured in photos that\ninspired John Ford\u2019s great oaters, it is recreated again in\nEgan\u2019s prose as his research took him \u201cto nearly every tribal\nhomeland that Curtis had gone to.\u201d  Apache Myth  In one triumphal moment, Curtis photographed \u201ca deerskin\nscroll holding symbols of the Apache creation myth.\u201d He\ndiscovered and preserved so much that could have been lost\notherwise, as Egan did on the High Plains.  Curtis was rediscovered in the 1970s. In the past decade,\ncomplete 20-volume sets have sold for as much as $1.8 million.\nSo there have been many books about the shutterbug, but Egan\u2019s\nkeen sense of place, people and history makes \u201cShort Nights of\nthe Shadow Catcher\u201d an exceptional marriage of author and\nsubject.  \u201cShort Nights of the Shadow Catcher: The Epic Life and\nImmortal Photographs of Edward Curtis\u201d is published by Houghton\nMifflin Harcourt (370 pages, $28).
