The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSuzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) \u2019s chief\nfinancial officer quit as widening losses at  India \u2019s biggest\nwind-turbine maker jeopardize its ability to meet debt\nrepayments this year.  Robin Banerjee , appointed CFO in March 2009, left to take\nup an undisclosed position and Head of Corporate Finance Kirti Vagadia will assume his responsibilities, Suzlon said today in\nan e-mailed statement. The shares fell to a one-month low.

Vestas CFO Henrik Norremark resigned\nlast month after the Danish company reported a loss four times\nwider than analyst estimates.  Losses at Suzlon grew to 2.86 billion rupees ($60 million)\nin the three months through December, the most in five quarters.\nThat prompted the company\u2019s auditors to examine its ability to\nraise funds as it seeks to meet debt repayments this year.  Suzlon\u2019s repayments may fall short by as much as $592\nmillion out of $700 million in debt due in 12 months, Charanjit Singh, a Bangalore-based analyst at HSBC Bank Plc, said this\nweek. The company may face $389 million in bond redemptions this\nyear if investors holding convertible notes choose not to swap\nthem for shares.
