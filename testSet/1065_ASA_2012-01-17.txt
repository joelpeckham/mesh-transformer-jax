 "context": "The following article called 'Investors Ignore Nordic Housing Bubble Risks as Hunt for Havens Picks Up' was published on 2012-01-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBond and currency investors in\n Europe  have flocked to Scandinavia to escape the euro area\u2019s\ndebt crisis. They may need to rethink their bets as the risk of\nasset bubbles threatens to trigger losses in Norway and Sweden.  The notion that the Nordic region is a haven \u201cis really a\nfalse perception,\u201d said David Deddouche, a foreign-exchange\nstrategist at  Societe Generale  SA in Paris, in an interview.\n\u201cThe risk is that at some stage there is a domestic development\nwhich pushes every investor out of the market at the same time\nand it is going to squeeze heavily. It\u2019s quite dangerous.\u201d  The risks aren\u2019t reflected in the countries\u2019 bond or\ncurrency markets, which investors are treating as havens from\nthe euro area thanks to fiscal surpluses in  Sweden  and Norway.\nSweden pays less than Germany to borrow for 10 years and\nNorway\u2019s government bond yields slumped to a record-low last\nweek, approaching parity with the largest euro-area economy.  Yet according to  Robert Shiller , the co-creator of the\nS&P/Case-Shiller home-price index, the two Nordic countries are\nin the grip of asset bubbles that will damage their economies.\nHe warns that policy makers should do more to protect their\ncredit and property markets from imbalances. In  Denmark , where a\nreal estate bubble burst in 2007,  home prices  may have further\nto fall, he said.  Policy makers \u201cshould start worrying now because when the\nhome prices get so high there\u2019s a problem,\u201d Shiller, who is\nalso an economics professor at  Yale University , said in a Jan.\n13 interview in  Stockholm .  Yields Rise  The yield on Norway\u2019s 10-year bond rose six basis points to\n1.88 percent as of 2:56 p.m. in Oslo. The difference between\nNorway\u2019s 10-year borrowing costs and the yield on similar-\nmaturity German bunds widened three basis points to eight.\nSweden\u2019s 10-year yield jumped four basis points to 1.64 percent.  Household debt in Norway will surge to 204 percent of\ndisposable incomes this year, the highest since at least 1988,\nthe central bank estimates. House prices doubled from 2001 to\n2010, and jumped an annual 8.5 percent last month, Norway\u2019s Real\nEstate Brokers Association said on Jan. 2.  In Sweden, the  International Monetary Fund  said in June\nhomes \u201cappear overvalued with enduring price falls likely,\u201d\nafter values tripled over the past 15 years.  House prices \ndropped 2 percent last quarter from a record, coming off a peak\nthat had been fueled by tax cuts, historically low central bank\npolicy rates and as the economy in 2010 rebounded at the fastest\npace in 40 years.  Bernanke, Greenspan  Swedish Housing Minister Stefan Attefall says the boom is\nprobably driven by supply shortages, after two reports\ncommissioned by the central bank found that gains can \u201clargely\nbe explained by what are usually called fundamental factors.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s what  Ben Bernanke  and  Alan Greenspan  did,\u201d said\nShiller, who predicted the U.S. housing market crash. \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re afraid of being blamed for saying something that alarms\npeople and makes the markets collapse, then you don\u2019t want to\nsay anything that could be wrong. You end up going along with\nthe conventional wisdom.\u201d  U.S. house prices have slumped about 30 percent since a\nJuly 2006 peak after the country\u2019s subprime bubble burst,\naccording to the S&P Case/Shiller Index, which tracks 20 major\nmetropolitan areas.  Foreclosure rates  tripled through 2009. The\nU.S. unemployment rate swelled as high as 10 percent in late\n2009 from an average of 4.6 percent in 2006.  AAA Club  Norway  and Sweden, both rated AAA with stable outlooks, are\namong the world\u2019s safest sovereign credits, default swap\ncontracts show. Norway, which isn\u2019t an EU member, offers the\nlowest risk and Sweden the third lowest after the U.S.,\naccording to bets by credit default swap traders. The club of\nAAA rated sovereigns grew smaller last week after  Standard &\nPoor\u2019s  downgraded nine euro members on Jan. 13, leaving only\nfour in the 17-nation currency bloc with the top rating. The\nU.S. lost its AAA grade at S&P in August.  \u201cThere are some arguments connected to safe havens that\nare probably in effect these days and that has to do with\ngovernment finances,\u201d said Kjersti Haugland, a senior economist\nat DNB ASA in Oslo, in an interview. While it\u2019s fair that fiscal\nsurpluses should bolster the countries\u2019 government bond markets,\nany imbalances in the economy can disrupt the currency markets\nvery suddenly, she said.  \u2018Very Illiquid\u2019  \u201cSince the Norwegian krone is such a very illiquid\ncurrency it is not a good investment alternative in times of\nhigh turbulence,\u201d Haugland said. \u201cWe have seen before, around\nChristmas 2008, we saw it very clearly that the euro/krone\nexchange rate shot above 10 so it was very dramatic, if they\nwanted to get out they had to accept a very low price for the\nNorwegian krone.\u201d  Norway\u2019s krone has gained 2.3 percent against the euro\nsince a Nov. 28 low. It traded at 7.6819 on Jan. 13. Sweden\u2019s\nkrona is up 4.7 percent against the euro in the same period, to\ntrade at 8.8649 at the end of last week. The Swedish currency\nweakened to more than 11 versus the euro at the height of the\ncrisis in March 2009.  Daily trading in the Norwegian krone averaged $50 billion\nin April 2010, or 1.3 percent of global turnover, according to a\nforeign exchange survey from 2010 by the  Bank for International\nSettlements . In Sweden\u2019s krona, the equivalent figure was $83.5\nbillion, or 2.2 percent of global  currency trading .  Sweden, whose government bond market is 550 billion kronor,\npays  about 17 basis points less  than  Germany  to borrow for 10\nyears. Norway, where liquidity is much scarcer in the country\u2019s\n200 billion-krone government bond market, pays only  six basis\npoints more  than the largest euro-area economy.  According to Deddouche at Societe Generale, limited\nliquidity in Norway and Sweden will amplify the fallout of any\neconomic decline as investors all try to leave through the same\nnarrow exit.  \u201cIt\u2019s a small market and it makes it a dangerous game,\u201d\nhe said.
