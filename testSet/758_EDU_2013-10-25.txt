 "context": "The following article called 'Muddy Waters Breaks Cold Streak Going Back to China in NQ Short' was published on 2013-10-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCarson Block , the  Muddy Waters LLC \nfounder whose short sales outside of  China  have borne little\nfruit, reclaimed a measure of success this week targeting a\ncompany in the country where he started out.  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ) , a Beijing-based mobile services provider\nthat started the week with a market capitalization of more than\n$1 billion, lost half its value after Block said on Oct. 24 that\nit fabricated revenue and lied about its cash. The shares\nextended a two-day slump to 54 percent yesterday even as the\ncompany labeled the assertions false, inaccurate and malicious.  \u201cIt speaks to the credibility that Carson has built in the\nmarketplace over time by conducting very high quality work,\u201d\nSahm Adrangi, who manages $250 million at New York-based hedge\nfund Kerrisdale Capital Management LLC., said in a phone\ninterview on Oct. 25. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very high opinion of\nCarson\u2019s work and he has proven himself to be one of the premier\nshort sellers in terms of putting together very high-quality\nresearch.\u201d  Share declines such as NQ Mobile\u2019s from $23.20 to $10.63\nused to be common for Block, a 37-year-old lawyer who switched\nto investing after he moved to Beijing in 1997. Since leaving\nChina a year ago, Block\u2019s bearish research on Singapore-based\n Olam International Ltd. (OLAM)  and Boston-based  American Tower Corp. (AMT) \nhad done less damage.  \u2018Massive Fraud\u2019  Block wrote in an Oct. 24 report that investors should sell\nNQ Mobile, saying the company inflated revenue and\nmisrepresented cash balances. The short seller said in an\ninterview with Bloomberg Television on Oct. 25 that the company\nwill end up like Sino-Forest Corp., the Chinese plantation\ncompany listed in  Canada  that filed for  bankruptcy protection \nlast year after Muddy Waters claimed that it exaggerated its\nrevenue.  NQ Mobile denied the allegations, holding a two-hour\nconference call with analysts and investors in which it detailed\nits financial statements and answered questions about Block\u2019s\naccusations.  \u201cWe welcome any third party the opportunity to check the\ncompany cash,\u201d Matt Mathison, the vice president of  capital\nmarkets  at NQ Mobile, said in a conference call on Oct. 25.\n\u201cThe truth and the facts are on our side.\u201d  NQ Mobile, whose co-chief executive officer is Omar Khan, a\nformer Samsung Electronics Co. chief strategy officer, raised\nits 2013 revenue estimate to as much as $188 million on Aug. 12\nfrom the upper limit of its prior forecast of $184 million.  \u201cWe believe it is a zero,\u201d Block wrote in his report.\n\u201cAt least 72 percent of NQ\u2019s purported 2012 China security\nrevenue is fictitious.\u201d  NQ said it will set up an independent committee that will\nreview  Muddy Waters \u2019 allegations, according to a PRNewswire\nstatement on Oct. 25.  \u2018Very Seriously\u2019  \u201cWe take all of these allegations very seriously, they are\nall completely false,\u201d Khan said in a phone interview with\nBloomberg TV on Oct. 25. \u201cWe are a very transparent company, we\nhave had two independent investment banks validate our cash\nbalances.\u201d  Short sellers have increased bets against NQ Mobile to a\n one-year high  over the past three months. Bearish wagers on the\nstock rose to 25 percent of shares outstanding on Oct. 23, the\nday before Block\u2019s report was made public, from 8.6 percent in\nJuly, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Markit, a\nLondon-based research firm.  The average short-interest for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500\nIndex is 2.3 percent and the stock would be the second-most\nshorted in the benchmark gauge for American equities if it were\na member, the data show.  10th Target  Ownership of put options to sell NQ Mobile shares soared to\na  record  105,194 on Oct. 23, 34 percent more than the number of\ncalls to buy, according to open interest data compiled by\nBloomberg. Almost 17,000 bearish contracts traded on average\neach day in the five days before the report was released, more\nthan 12 times the daily mean this year.  NQ Mobile is at least Block\u2019s 10th target after he began to\npublish his research in June 2010. Block gained fame for\nhis short-selling calls in  Asia  after regulators halted trading\nin four of the first five companies he wrote about. Hedge fund\nmanager  John Paulson  sold his Sino-Forest stake at a loss after\nBlock said the company overstated its plantation assets.   \u201cWe have seen companies defraud auditors numerous times in\nChina with forged bank statements,\u201d Block said in the Bloomberg\nTelevision interview. NQ \u201ccited certain companies elsewhere in\nChina that had all-cash at Level 2,\u201d but that is not the case,\nBlock said. \u201cThis is a major red flag.\u201d  Previous Calls  Critical  reports  by Muddy Waters drove down the shares of\neight companies by an average of about 77 percent, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Bets against American Tower, his first\nAmerican target, Beijing-based Fushi Copperweld Inc., a maker of\ncopper-clad metal wire and Focus Media Holding Ltd. have\nbackfired.  Focus Media, the Hong Kong-based advertising firm that\nBlock claims overstated its network, recovered share price\nlosses of as much as 39 percent when it went private earlier\nthis year in a Carlyle Group LP-led takeover.  New Oriental\nEducation & Technology (EDU)  has soared 85 percent after Block said\nthe financial statements of the education services provider\u2019s\nunits are fraudulent.  Investors in American Tower, the Boston-based operator of\ncell-phone antennas, were unshaken by Block\u2019s claims on July 17\nthat the company is worth less than its share price, and the\nstock has gained 8.2 percent since the report.  \u2018Track Record\u2019  Their \u201ctrack record is spotty, but it definitely had an\nimpact,\u201d  David Semple , who manages international equity\ninvestments at the Van Eck  Emerging Markets  Fund in New York,\nsaid by phone on Oct. 25.   Muddy Waters said Tianjin Yidatong, NQ\u2019s largest trade\ndebtor, is controlled by NQ Mobile and not an independent\ncompany. NQ Mobile\u2019s market share in China is about 1.5 percent,\nnot the 55 percent it reports, Block wrote. The company\u2019s paying\nuser base in China is fewer than 250,000, versus the 6 million\nit claims, he said.  Oppenheimer & Co. reduced its  recommendation  on the shares\nto the equivalent of neutral from buy and removed its price\nestimate, according to a report on Oct. 25.  \u201cWhile many of the allegations raised were not new, the\nreport did provide some anecdotal evidence supporting these\nallegations,\u201d Andy Yueng, an analyst at Oppenheimer wrote in\nthe report. \u201cThe controversy is likely to remain an overhang on\nNQ in the near term.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nNikolaj Gammeltoft in  New York  at \n ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net ;\nMatthew Kanterman in New York at \n mkanterman2@bloomberg.net ;\nBelinda Cao in New York at \n lcao4@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTal Barak Harif at \n tbarak@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of New Oriental Education & Technology Group, Inc. was 2.7364680767059326 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of New Oriental Education & Technology Group, Inc. was ",
