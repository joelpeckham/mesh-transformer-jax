(DIS)  and other movie and\nTV studios have asked a federal court to dismiss their\ncopyright-infringement case against the file-sharing website\n Lime Wire  LLC and its founder, Mark Gorton, according to a Nov.\n7 court filing.  The studios, including  Viacom Inc. (VIAB) , News Corp.\u2019s Twentieth\nCentury Fox Film and Time Warner Inc.\u2019s Warner Bros.\nEntertainment, filed the suit in federal court in  New York  in\nFebruary 2012. They claimed a \u201cstaggering\u201d amount of\ninfringement took place through the site, and that \u201cmillions of\nusers copied billions of files using Lime Wire\u201d without paying\nanything to copyright owners.  Lime Wire developed peer-to-peer software that let people\nshare digital entertainment files on their computers with other\npeople over the Internet. TV shows such as \u201c South Park \u201d and\n\u201c Desperate Housewives \u201d and movies including \u201cAvatar\u201d and the\n\u201cHarry Potter\u201d films were among the material allegedly\ninfringed, according to the filing.  Gorton operates  Tower Capital Research LLC,  a New York-based hedge fund that trades securities based on mathematical\nalgorithms it developed. \u201cGorton directed and benefited from\nLime Wire\u2019s inducement of infringement,\u201d the entertainment\ncompanies said in one of their filings.  U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood in May 2010 found Lime Wire\nand Gorton liable for inducing infringement of copyrights for\nrecorded music. The site was shut down by an October 2010 court\norder. Lime Wire settled with the recording industry for $105\nmillion in May 2011 during a trial in  Manhattan  to determine\ndamages.  No terms for the settlement of the case brought by the\nstudios were disclosed.  The case is Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. v. Lime Wire\nLLC, 12-cv-00818, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New\nYork (Manhattan).  The earlier case is Arista Records LLC v. Lime Wire LLC,\n06-cv-05936, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York\n(Manhattan).  For more copyright news, click here.  Patents  Piggy Pushers\u2019 Sock Patent Not Infringed, Appeals Court Rules  A federal appeals court affirmed a lower-court ruling that\na patent wasn\u2019t infringed based on its understanding of the\ndifference between a sock and a shoe.  The case, filed in a  Michigan  federal court in July 2010,\nwas between two makers of footwear for infants. Piggy Pushers of\nHolland, Michigan, claimed that products made by  Skidders\nFootwear Inc.  infringed patent 6,385,779.  The patent covers a sock for a crawling infant. According\nto the patent, which was issued in May 2002, the sock has a\ngripper element in both the upper and lower surface that\nincreases friction and makes it possible for a baby to crawl on\nslippery surfaces.  The product made by New York-based Skidders has a foot-surrounding sock bonded to a rubber outsole. In May 2012 the\nlower court said there was nothing in the language of the patent\nthat could suggest the inventor meant \u201csock\u201d to mean anything\nother than the ordinary definition.  The lower court said the Skidders products had a number of\ndifferences from socks, including having a durable outsole, and\nleft- and right-foot designations.  In its Nov. 8 ruling, the Washington-based  U.S. Court of\nAppeals  for the Federal Circuit said the lower court was\ncorrect. Piggy Pushers, the court said, failed to present\nevidence refuting Skidders\u2019 claim that its product didn\u2019t fit\nthe definition of a sock.  The appeal is Piggy Pushers LLC v. Skidders Footwear LLC,\n2013-1107, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\n( Washington ).  The lower court case is Piggy Pushers LLC v. Skidders\nFootwear Inc., 1:10-cv-00644, U.S. District Court, Western\nDistrict of Michigan (Grand Rapids).  Furuno Complaint Against Garmin, Navico to Be Investigated  The U.S. International Trade Commission  said  Nov. 8 that it\nwill investigate a complaint filed in September by  Furuno\nElectric Co.

The suit, filed in federal court in Santa Ana,  California ,\nis related to the use of the phrase \u201cDesigned by Roger\nCleveland\u201d on some of Callaway\u2019s golf clubs.

Roger\nCleveland Golf said consumers have been confused by Callaway\u2019s\nuse of the name, and that, to no avail, it has sent cease-and-desist notices to Carlsbad, California-based Callaway.  It asked the court to bar Callaway\u2019s use of the Cleveland\nname, and for awards of money damages, including profits\nattributable to the alleged infringement, together with attorney\nfees and litigation costs.  Callaway didn\u2019t respond immediately to an e-mailed request\nfor comment.  The case is Roger Cleveland Golf Co. v. Callaway Golf Co.,\n8:13-cv-01642, U.S. District Court, Central District of\nCalifornia (Santa Ana).  \u2018Famous Jameis\u2019 Trademark Filing Is Made by  Alabama  Football Fan  An Alabama football fan has applied to register the phrase\n\u201cFamous Jameis\u201d as a trademark. The phrase has been used to\ndescribe Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston,\nthe Heisman Trophy favorite.  Mukul Mehra, 40, filed the trademark request on Oct. 24,\naccording to the database of the U.S. Patent and  Trademark\nOffice .  Mehra said in a telephone interview he has no connection to\nWinston, a redshirt freshman from Bessemer, Alabama, a suburb of\nBirmingham.  \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily geared toward him,\u201d said Mehra, who\nhas a medical degree from the  University of Alabama  School of\nMedicine in Birmingham. \u201cI don\u2019t know what our intent\ncompletely is. We haven\u2019t worked all of that out.\u201d  Pamela Deese, a partner at the Washington law firm Arent\nFox, said in a telephone interview that Winston probably would\nbe awarded the trademark if he moved to register it.  \u201cWe would hope the examiner is savvy enough to recognize\nthat Famous Jameis refers to the potential Heisman Trophy\nwinner,\u201d said Deese, whose clients include Houston Rockets\nguard Jeremy Lin. \u201cYou can\u2019t register a trademark for somebody\nelse\u2019s name without their permission, which is what happened\nwith Jeremy.\u201d  Mehra said he has contacted a local sports marketing\ncompany about producing \u201cFamous Jameis\u201d T-shirts. He also said\nhe\u2019s open to a partnership with Winston or Florida State. \u201cIf\nit\u2019s something they\u2019re interested in using we could potentially\nmarket it together,\u201d Mehra said.  The 6-foot-4, 228-pound Winston, at -500, is the favorite\nat sportsbook.com to win the Heisman Trophy, which is given\nannually to college football\u2019s best player. A $50 bet would win\n$10.  Winston has completed 149 of 212 passes for 2,502 yards and\n24 touchdowns, fifth in college football\u2019s top level. He\u2019s also\nthrown six interceptions and run for three touchdowns.  Deese said it would behoove Winston to move quickly on the\ntrademark.  \u201cThe longer you wait, the more costly it gets,\u201d she said.
