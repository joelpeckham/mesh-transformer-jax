 "context": "The following article called 'Rubber to Extend Bull Market as Stimulus Accelerates Recovery' was published on 2012-12-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRubber will likely extend a  bull\nmarket  next year as monetary and fiscal stimulus from  Japan  to\n China  and the U.S. will accelerate a global recovery and boost\nraw-material demand.  Futures in  Tokyo , a global benchmark, will climb 14 percent\nto 344 yen a kilogram ($3,981 a metric ton) by March, according\nto the median estimate from seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg,\nwho correctly predicted in September that the price would climb\nto 300 yen by the end of 2012. The threshold was crossed\nyesterday for the first time since May.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who won a landslide\nelection victory last week, instructed his ministers to compile\nemergency economic measures early next month. His call for\nunlimited monetary easing and a 2 percent inflation target has\nsent the yen to a 28-month low against the dollar, helping\nexporters such as  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  boost sales overseas,\nleading to stronger demand for the commodity used in tires.  \u201cAbe will likely do whatever he can to end Japan\u2019s decade-\nlong deflation and revive its economic expansion,\u201d Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo,\nsaid by phone today. \u201cInvestors are betting on his scenario.\u201d  After rallying 47 percent from this year\u2019s low of 205.6 yen\nreached on Aug. 14, futures were 15 percent higher for the year\nat 302.5 yen at the settlement today, reversing last year\u2019s 36\npercent slump. The price is still 44 percent below a record high\nof 535.7 yen on Feb. 18, 2011.  Weaker Yen  The yen touched 86.64 per dollar, the weakest since Aug. 3,\n2010, and traded at 86.43, extending this year\u2019s loss to 12\npercent. A weaker Japanese currency makes yen-based contracts\ncheaper for holders of other currencies.  JPMorgan revised its yen projection today, saying the\ncurrency will fall to 90 against the dollar in the second\nquarter next year. Nomura reduced its yen forecast to 90 per\ndollar for the second quarter from 85, citing Abe\u2019s\n\u201caggressive\u201d push toward a 2 percent inflation target.  The  Federal Reserve  said Dec. 12 it would buy $45 billion\nof  Treasury securities  a month from January, adding to $40\nbillion a month of existing mortgage-debt purchases. Data this\nmonth showed the world\u2019s largest economy grew at a 3.1 percent\nannual rate last quarter, exceeding all projections in a\nBloomberg survey. The  International Monetary Fund  expects a 3.6\npercent global expansion in 2013, from 3.3 percent this year.  Biggest Producers  Rubber production is expected to decline as the so-called\nwintering season starts in February in  Thailand , the world\u2019s\nlargest producer and exporter, slashing latex production. Output\nin  Indonesia , the second-biggest grower, may drop for the first\ntime in four years in 2013 as the country limits output and\nshipments in coordination with other producers.  Production may decline 8.9 percent to 2.77 million tons\nfrom an estimated 3.04 million tons this year, according to\nAgriculture Minister Suswono. That would be the first fall since\n2009, when output dropped 11 percent to 2.44 million tons, data\nfrom Indonesia\u2019s Directorate General of Estate Crops show.  Thailand, Indonesia and  Malaysia , representing 67 percent\nof global supply, agreed in August to combat lower prices by\nlimiting shipments and cutting down trees, paring 450,000 tons.  \u201cRubber will extend the rally, boosted by Japan\u2019s stimulus\nmeasures, declining supplies during wintering seasons and\nexport-cut measures,\u201d Chaiwat Muenmee, analyst at DS Futures\nCo., said by phone from Bangkok.  Rubber will also draw support from better demand in China,\nthe world\u2019s largest consumer, as the nation\u2019s economic growth is\nforecast to accelerate next year.  \u201cAs  China\u2019s economy  has been on a recovery trajectory,\ndemand from the auto sector will also recover,\u201d said Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company Market Risk Advisory.  China Manufacturing  China\u2019s manufacturing may expand at a faster pace in\nDecember, according to a preliminary reading on Dec. 14 by  HSBC\nHoldings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit Economics, adding to signs the economy\nis strengthening as a new leadership takes power. The government\nhas approved projects for the construction of about 2,000\nkilometers (1,250 miles) of roads, subways in 18 cities and\nextra spending on railways.  Chinese monthly passenger-vehicle sales rose to the highest\nlevel in almost two years in November, beating analyst estimates,\nas  consumer confidence  improved with the economy and dealerships\nincreased discounts to reduce stockpiles.  Wholesale deliveries, including multipurpose and sport-\nutility vehicles, gained 8.75 percent to 1.46 million units last\nmonth, according to the China Association of Automobile\nManufacturers. Passenger car sales will increase about 10\npercent next year, according to Xu Changming, director of\ninformation resource development at the State Information Center,\npart of the nation\u2019s top economic planning body.
