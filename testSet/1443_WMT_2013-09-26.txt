 "context": "The following article called 'Drop in U.S. Jobless Claims Increases Confidence' was published on 2013-09-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmericans unexpectedly filed fewer\nclaims for  unemployment benefits  last week, highlighting labor-market gains that are shoring up  consumer confidence .  Jobless  claims  dropped by 5,000 to 305,000 in the week\nended Sept. 21, a Labor Department report showed today in\n Washington . The monthly average was the lowest since 2007. The\nBloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose for the third straight\nweek, another report showed.  Fewer dismissals show employers are confident sales will\nhold up and sustain growth in the world\u2019s largest economy amid\nthe budget battle in Washington. At the same time, higher\nborrowing costs threaten to curb corporate expansion as well as\nthe household spending that accounts for 70 percent of gross\ndomestic product.  \u201cWe definitely have seen a gentle downtrend in claims over\nthe course of the year,\u201d said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist\nat Pierpont Securities LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .\n\u201cUnfortunately, the problem for the labor market for a long\ntime has not really been the pace of layoffs, it\u2019s been the slow\npace of hiring.\u201d  Last week\u2019s figure for claims was the lowest since 2007,\nexcluding the week ending Sept. 6, when a change in computer\nsystems in California and  Nevada  distorted the figures.  Stocks rose, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index advancing\n0.4 percent to 1,698.67 at the close in  New York . The yield on\nthe 10-year Treasury note climbed two basis points, or 0.02\npercentage point, to 2.65 percent.  Consumer Confidence  Other data today confirmed the economy accelerated in the\nsecond quarter and showed fewer Americans signed contracts to\nbuy previously owned homes in August.  GDP rose at a 2.5 percent annualized rate, unrevised from\nthe previous estimate, after expanding 1.1 percent in the first\nquarter, the Commerce Department reported.  The index of  pending home sales  fell 1.6 percent as a\nrecent rise in  mortgage rates  slows momentum in the housing\nmarket, according to figures from the National Association of\nRealtors.  In the U.K. today, a report showed economic growth\naccelerated in the second quarter as higher  consumer spending \nhelped blunt the impact of a drop in business investment.  Household expenditures rose 0.3 percent and disposable\nincome increased 1.5 percent, the most in a year, the  Office for\nNational Statistics  said in  London . Income was boosted by bonus\npayments being deferred to take advantage of a  tax cut . GDP\nadvanced 0.7 percent in the quarter, matching a previous\nestimate.  Economists\u2019 Estimates  Economists\u2019 estimates for U.S. jobless claims in the\nBloomberg survey ranged from 310,000 to 370,000 after the prior\nweek\u2019s previously reported 309,000.  The four-week average dropped to 308,000 from 315,000 in\nthe prior week, today\u2019s Labor Department report showed.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  is among companies hiring after\neliminating positions during the recession. The retailer is\ntaking on 55,000 seasonal workers and adding another 70,000\npart-time and full-time employees as it gears up for the holiday\nseason and reverses workforce reductions that made it hard to\nkeep store shelves stocked.  The U.S. workforce at Wal-Mart\u2019s namesake and Sam\u2019s Club\nwarehouse chains fell by about 120,000 employees in the past\nfive years, to about 1.3 million, according to regulatory\nfilings. In that time, the company has added more than 500 U.S.\nstores through July 31.  Jobs Report  A Labor Department report next week will probably show that\nemployers stepped up the pace of hiring. Payrolls increased by\n175,000 this month, according to the median forecast in a\nBloomberg survey, following a gain of 169,000 in August. The\nprojected gain in employment would be the biggest in four\nmonths. The jobless rate is forecast to hold at 7.3 percent.  Saying they need to see more evidence of improvement in the\neconomy and the labor market, Federal Reserve policy makers last\nweek unexpectedly refrained from the reducing the pace of bond\npurchases intended to spur growth.  Gains in equities and  home prices  are boosting household\nwealth, laying the groundwork for a sustained increase in\n consumer spending .  A report yesterday showed household net worth climbed to\n$74.8 trillion in the second quarter, an increase of 1.8 percent\nfrom the previous three months, the Fed said.  The value of financial assets, including stocks and pension\nfund holdings, held by American households increased $674\nbillion in the second quarter. Household real-estate assets grew\nby $602.3 billion.  Household Finances  An increase in optimism about household finances helped\nspur a third straight gain in sentiment last week, according to\nthe Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index. The measure rose to minus\n28.1, the highest since the period ended Aug. 11, from minus\n29.4. The  gauge of finances  climbed to a seven-week high as the\nfewest respondents since late April viewed their budgets as\n\u201cpoor.\u201d  The figures contrast with a report this week from the\nConference Board, which showed its confidence index declined\nthis month to the weakest level since May. At the same time, a\ngauge of present conditions improved.  Consumers are spending more on big-ticket items like cars.\nMotor vehicles sold in August at the  fastest  annualized rate\nsince November 2007, according to data from Ward\u2019s Automotive\nGroup. The latest results at General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co.,\nand Toyota Motor Corp. surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates.  Holiday Shopping  Some Americans are cutting back elsewhere, a sign spending\nwill be slow to accelerate heading into the  holiday shopping\nseason  without faster growth in incomes and wages. U.S. chains\nare bracing for a tough holiday season, when sales are projected\nto rise 2.4 percent, the smallest gain since 2009, according to\nChicago-based ShopperTrak.  \u201cThe general sentiment is somewhat more conservative,\u201d\nClay Creasey, chief financial officer at Toys R Us Inc., said on\na Sept. 24 earnings call. \u201cI have seen the numbers or surveys\nor whatever that talk about continued slowness in the toy\ncategory.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nVictoria Stilwell in Washington at \n vstilwell1@bloomberg.net ;\nShobhana Chandra in Washington at \n schandra1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChristopher Wellisz at \n cwellisz@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 61.858619689941406 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
