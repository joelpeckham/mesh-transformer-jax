The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInternational Business Machines\nCorp. (IBM) , faced with rising health care costs for retirees, says it\nwill move them to a health exchange where they may have cheaper\nplan options.  The move affects about 110,000 Medicare-eligible retirees,\n Doug Shelton , an IBM spokesman, said by telephone. The company\nhas chosen the Extend Health exchange by Towers Watson, the\ncountry\u2019s largest private Medicare exchange, to provide more\noptions for prescription drug, dental and vision care, the\nArmonk, New York-based company said in a statement e-mailed\ntoday.  IBM\u2019s move is the latest in a string of large changes that\norganizations have made to counter rising health costs. In\nAugust,  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  decided to drop health\nbenefits for 15,000 of its workers\u2019 spouses, while Michigan\nGovernor  Rick Snyder  tried to reduce costs by moving municipal\nretirees to exchanges.  \u201cThis transition provides more choice and flexibility at\nequal or better costs to our retirees,\u201d IBM said in the\nstatement. \u201cWhile some retirees may be skeptical today, studies\nshow that the majority of people who are presented the concept\nof an exchange are skeptical at first, but once they understand\nthe options available to them through these exchanges, they have\na more positive outlook.\u201d  Bigger Beneficiary Pool  IBM had projected that with its current plans, costs for\nretirees would triple by 2020. Most of that would affect\nretirees\u2019 premiums and out-of-pocket costs.  IBM said the new arrangement puts the retirees in a bigger\npool of beneficiaries, spreading risk and lowering cost.  Reuters reported the change yesterday.  \u201cIBM didn\u2019t make this change to save money -- it does not\nreduce our costs,\u201d Shelton said, noting that IBM\u2019s subsidies\nwere capped in the 1990s.  IBM has been holding briefing meetings with groups of\nretirees to answer questions about the transition. A meeting in\n San Jose ,  California , on Sept. 4 drew 1,300 retirees, the\ncompany said.  The company has made other moves to lessen its costs for\ncurrent employees. In the second quarter, IBM spent $1 billion\nto restructure its workforce, cutting more than 3,300 employees\nin the U.S. and  Canada , according to Alliance@IBM, an employee\ngroup. It also required U.S. hardware division employees to take\na week off with one-third of the pay.  IBM doesn\u2019t disclose the number of employees by country or\nby division. The company\u2019s total workforce was 434,246 as of\nDec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Sarah Frier  in New York at \n sfrier1@bloomberg.net .
