 "context": "The following article called 'Banks Charge States Millions in Debt Binge to Fix Subprime Bust' was published on 2010-07-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of America  Corp., owner of the\nmost-active subprime lender, Countrywide Financial Corp., earned\n$2.9 million in interest and fees for a line of credit  Arizona \nused through June to balance a budget undermined by the housing-\nmarket collapse.  \n Morgan Stanley , fined $102 million by  Massachusetts  last\nmonth for allegedly breaking home-lending laws, shared in\n$579,000 of fees from helping run a $120 million bond sale for\nthe state last week that pushed debt payments from this fiscal\nyear into future budgets. Wachovia Bank NA and Bank of America\nmanaged $400 million of Chicago transportation note sales in\n2009 and 2010 to cover delayed state funds even though\nWachovia\u2019s parent Wells Fargo & Co. and Countrywide have been\nsued by Illinois for steering minority borrowers to subprime\nloans.  \n New Jersey , New Hampshire and other U.S. states also needed\nbudget-balancing help that enriched the same Wall Street firms\nthat touched off the longest economic slump since the 1930s by\npackaging loans to unqualified borrowers. States issued $92\nbillion of long-term debt since Jan. 1, 2009, generating about\n$488 million for banks based on the average underwriting fee of\n$5.30 per $1,000 of bonds, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  \n \u201cYou\u2019re basically rewarding those who got you into the\nmess,\u201d Arizona\u2019s Treasurer  Dean Martin  said in an interview.  \n Martin\u2019s state, with the nation\u2019s second-highest home-\nforeclosure rate after Nevada, paid Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley,\n Goldman Sachs Group  Inc. and other firms involved in subprime-\nmortgage trading more than $5 million to help raise $1.4 billion\nto balance its budget by selling state offices, prisons and\nfuture state lottery revenue, bond-sale documents show.  \n How to \u2018Stick It\u2019  \n \u201cEveryone\u2019s saying they want to stick it to Wall Street,\u201d\nMartin, 35, said from Phoenix. \u201cIf you want to stick it to  Wall\nStreet , balance your budget.\u201d  \n Banks helped states add $43 billion of debt last year, the\nmost since 2004, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in May, as they\ncoped with what the U.S. Census Bureau says was a $95 billion\ndecline in  tax collections  from September 2008 to the end of\n2009. Cost cuts are needed, too: budget deficits will reach $140\nbillion in fiscal 2011, which began July 1 for most states, the\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based\nresearcher,  said in June .  \n States have little choice but to use prominent Wall Street\nfirms to market their debt because only the biggest banks have\nthe resources to support such large deals, said  John Sinsheimer ,\nIllinois\u2019s capital-markets director.  \n Services Rendered  \n \u201cTo put together a group of small banks would be an\nunmanageable task,\u201d Sinsheimer said by telephone from Chicago.\nIllinois paid Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch & Co. $754,000\nwhen it sold $1.3 billion of short-term notes July 20 to make up\nfor a decline in tax revenue. \u201cWe pay for services rendered and\nwe\u2019re getting services rendered,\u201d he said.  \n Underwriting debt isn\u2019t the only way banks profit from\nstates battered by a decline in tax revenue last year that was\nthe steepest on record, according to the Nelson A. Rockefeller\nInstitute of Government in Albany. At least 12, including New\nJersey, New Hampshire and Ohio, are hiring investment banks to\ndevise ways to use borrowing to finance or put off millions of\ndollars of interest payments they can\u2019t afford in their 2010 or\n2011 budgets.  \n New Jersey paid Morgan Stanley $143,000 to sell $94 million\nof four-month notes July 12 to cover bond payments due July 15\nand Aug. 1, according to testimony from the Office of Public\nFinance meeting at which the deal was approved. The notes will\nbe refinanced in September in a $268 million deal that will\ndefer for about a decade $202 million of payments due this year.\nThe maneuvers will generate $1.2 million in fees, said a June 29\ntransaction summary Morgan Stanley prepared for lawmakers.  \n Shifting Payments  \n New Jersey earlier this year paid Merrill Lynch and others\nmore than $3.5 million in a refinancing of $703 million of bonds\nthat shifted $679 million of debt payments due through 2014 into\nthe future. New Hampshire paid $119,000 to UBS Financial\nServices Inc., a unit of Zurich-based  UBS AG , for a $45 million\ndeal that saved $48 million for this year\u2019s state budget by\npushing current interest payments into the next nine years,\naccording to bond documents.  \n \u201cDebt restructuring, in the form of issuing bonds to defer\ndebt service, became a common solution\u201d to budget gaps in 2009,\nMoody\u2019s said in its report on state borrowing.  \n Budget-survival tactics that benefit banks extend beyond\nthe state level.  \n In New Jersey, 56 school districts issued $183 million in\nshort-term notes after the state withheld aid payments due June\n8 and June 22, said Richard Vespucci, a spokesman for the state\nDepartment of Education.  \n University Borrowing  \n Illinois public universities were given authority by the\nLegislature to issue debt to make up for missed state payments\nand Chicago\u2019s Regional Transportation Authority, the second-\nlargest U.S. public transport system, has borrowed $400 million\nsince last year to cover delayed aid. New Hampshire this month\nused a $25 million advance from its state university, which will\nbe repaid with  borrowed funds , to help plug a budget gap.  \n Suggesting that New Hampshire\u2019s deals will reward firms\nthat caused the state\u2019s budget problems is \u201csimplistic,\u201d New\nHampshire Treasurer  Catherine Provencher  said by telephone from\nConcord. \u201cThe issues are much more complicated and interwoven\nto make a direct connection,\u201d she said on July 12.  \n New Jersey Treasurer  Andrew Eristoff  said the Wall Street\nbankers states work with are distinct from the banking segments\nthat were involved in mortgage finance.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s a huge company we\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said July\n12 after the $94 million Morgan Stanley-led debt restructuring\nwas approved.  \n Millions in Settlements  \n Massachusetts Attorney General  Martha Coakley  fined\ninvestment banks including Morgan Stanley and  Goldman Sachs  for\nfunding brokers lending to homeowners who couldn\u2019t afford their\nmortgages, a violation of state law. Since 2008, she\u2019s won more\nthan $440 million of settlements, according to  news releases \nfrom her office.  \n Morgan Stanley was among four co-senior managers of a $120\nmillion Massachusetts debt-restructuring last week and Goldman\nwas part of the 21-firm selling group, bond records show. Both\nfirms admitted no wrongdoing in their settlements with Coakley.  \n Coakley wouldn\u2019t discuss the state\u2019s continued use of the\nfirms, according to her spokeswoman, Amie Breton.  Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York, and  Jennifer Sala  of Morgan Stanley declined to comment.  \n Illinois Suits  \n In Illinois, Attorney General  Lisa Madigan  has sued  Wells\nFargo  and Countrywide, the two largest U.S. mortgage lenders\nbefore the  housing market  collapsed in 2007, for improperly\nsteering minority homeowners into subprime loans. The banks\u2019\nactions led to a surge in foreclosures projected to reduce\nIllinois property values by $126 billion by 2012, Madigan\u2019s\ncomplaint against Wells Fargo says.  \n \u201cPlummeting property values mean a shrinking tax base for\nfunds to support governmental services,\u201d the July 31, 2009,\ncomplaint against San Francisco-based Wells Fargo says.  \n Wachovia Bank, which Wells Fargo acquired in January 2009,\nwas senior manager of a $260 million short-term bond sale in\nJune 2009 by the Chicago Regional Transportation Authority. The\nagency was seeking to cover state payments delayed as part of a\nbudget-balancing strategy. Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch\nserved as lead underwriter on a new $140 million deal on July 19\nto help the same agency manage delays in state aid.  \n Bank Comments  \n Through a spokeswoman,  Robyn Ziegler , Madigan declined to\ncomment. So did Ferris Morrison, a spokeswoman for Wachovia, in\na July 19 telephone interview.  Bill Halldin , a Bank of America\nspokesman in San Francisco, said his firm gives states good\nvalue.  \n \u201cOur credit solutions are all priced competitively based\non current market dynamics,\u201d he said in a telephone interview\nJuly 21.  \n Arizona\u2019s Martin, a Republican who ended his run for\ngovernor July 10, said as long as states don\u2019t cut spending to\nmatch reduced tax revenue, Wall Street will be waiting to help\nthem borrow.  \n \u201cThe state is doing exactly the same thing a lot of\nsubprime homeowners did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a crisis that\nwas caused by too much debt, and states are resorting to exactly\nthe same thing.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Dunstan McNichol  in Trenton, New Jersey, at \n dmcnichol@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 9.582549095153809 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
