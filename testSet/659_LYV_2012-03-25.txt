 "context": "The following article called 'Madonna Grabs Back Pop Crown With Shock Disco' was published on 2012-03-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMadonna sets herself some tough\nchallenges on her 12th studio album, \u201cMDNA.\u201d She wants to\nattack her former husband, keep up the tempo, look relevant and\nsweep away all those preening young pretenders to her crown.  \u201cThere\u2019s only one queen, and that\u2019s Madonna,\u201d she has one\nof those pop princesses, Nicki Minaj, declare on one song.  \u201cMDNA\u201d tries hard, often too hard, and is soaked in slick\nproduction. After 30 years in the business, Madonna Louise\nCiccone should know she doesn\u2019t need the lavish studio effects\nof newer stars such as Lady Gaga,  Britney Spears  or Rihanna.  It\u2019s a better record than was suggested by the first\nsingle, \u201c Give Me All Your Luvin\u2019 .\u201d That cheerleader number was\npreviewed to 111 million viewers on Feb. 5 at the most-watched\nSuper Bowl Halftime Show in history -- then stalled at No. 10 in\nthe charts. Not content with that piece of disposable pop\nrecalling  Toni Basil , Madonna\u2019s lightweight follow-up single\n\u201cGirl Gone Wild\u201d references Cyndi Lauper\u2019s 1980s disco line\n\u201cgirls, just wanna have fun.\u201d  The first four tracks sound like castoffs from Madonna\u2019s\ndance-crazed \u201cHard Candy\u201d from 2008, \u201cConfessions on a Dance\nFloor\u201d from 2005 and accompanying live releases.  The twist this time is her renewed desire to provoke. While\nshe says \u201cMDNA\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201cMadonna DNA,\u201d it\nalso references the drug MDMA on \u201cI\u2019m Addicted.\u201d  Lover Shot  \u201cGang Bang\u201d -- another misguided title -- has her wanting\nto shoot a lover and ends \u201cI wanna see him die, over and over\nand over and over.\u201d  It\u2019s like a Guy Ritchie movie. Her divorce from the U.K.\ndirector looms over the record. \u201cWould you have married me if I\nwere poor?\u201d she asks on \u201cLove Spent,\u201d adding \u201cI guess if I\nwas your treasury, you\u2019d have found the time to treasure me.\u201d  In \u201cI Don\u2019t Give A,\u201d Madonna declares \u201cI tried to be\nyour wife, I diminished myself\u201d and \u201cyou were so mad at me,\nwho\u2019s got custody? Lawyers, suck it up. Didn\u2019t have a pre-nup.\u201d  As ever, Madonna\u2019s words and singing rarely match her\ncatchy tunes and attitude. She\u2019s happier recalling past glories.\n\u201cMDNA\u201d opens by quoting from the excellent \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d\n(1989). The final four tracks reunite her with William Orbit,\nwho produced her glacial \u201cRay of Light\u201d in 1998.  With Orbit at the helm, the boasting ends. We hear the\nconfessional side of the woman behind the Madonna brand. There\u2019s\nthe acoustic \u201cMasterpiece,\u201d a Golden Globe-winning love song\nfrom the film \u201cW.E.\u201d The ballad \u201cFalling Free\u201d is better,\nall tender strings and a vulnerable voice shorn of bombast.  Madonna, 53, is preparing for another world tour. (The last\nraised $408 million, the most by a solo artist, according to its\npromoter  Live Nation (LYV)  Entertainment Inc.) She has fame and\nfortune aplenty, of course, yet signs off with the wistful hope\nthat she can \u201cturn around a love again.\u201d  Rating: ***.  \u201cMDNA\u201d is released today on Interscope/Live Nation,\npriced about $10 in the U.S. There\u2019s a deluxe edition for $16,\nadding five tracks.
