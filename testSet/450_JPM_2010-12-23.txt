 "context": "The following article called 'Payments Rising to $7 Billion Next Year Spur New Offer: Argentina Credit' was published on 2010-12-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nArgentina is attempting to persuade\ndebt holders to accept a swap offer for the second time this\nyear as the government seeks to regain access to international\nmarkets with $7 billion of foreign obligations due next year.  Bonds rose after the government reopened the offer\nyesterday with similar terms to a June restructuring that\nexchanged $12.2 billion of defaulted notes. The extra yield\ninvestors demand to hold Argentine dollar bonds instead of U.S.\nTreasuries fell 319 basis points since June 1 to 495, or 252\nbasis points above the average for all emerging markets debt,\naccording to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  is seeking to win\nover bondholders as interest and principal payments on external\ndebt escalate $400 million next year to $7 billion, which the\ngovernment will likely cover by using reserves, according to\n Eduardo Suarez , an emerging-markets strategist at RBC Capital\nMarkets in Toronto. Lawsuits by creditors holding $4 billion in\ndefaulted notes and seeking full repayment remain a hurdle for\nthe government, he said.  \u201cThey will need to sell bonds at some point, unless they\nwant to continue to use reserves\u201d to make debt payments, Suarez\nsaid in a telephone interview. The new proposal \u201cis a signal to\ncreditors that Argentina is trying to become more market\nfriendly, but it won\u2019t solve the lawsuit issue,\u201d he said.  Benchmark dollar bonds due in December 2033 rose for a\nfifth day yesterday, with the yield falling to 9.02 percent, the\nlowest since Nov. 11. The  average yield  on Argentine dollar\nbonds dropped almost two percentage points, or 200 basis points,\nthis year to 8.88 percent yesterday as Fernandez restructured\ndebt and record-low interest rates in the U.S. and Europe\nspurred demand for the country\u2019s securities.  Gesture to Bondholders  The terms of the offer won\u2019t give creditors par bonds or\npast-due interest on notes due in 2017 that were issued in this\nyear\u2019s swap, Finance Secretary  Hernan Lorenzino  said in a\ntelephone interview in Buenos Aires yesterday.  \u201cThis is a gesture to bondholders who didn\u2019t\nparticipate,\u201d said Lorenzino, 38. \u201cArgentina is demonstrating\nits willingness to offer a solution and leave the default\nbehind.\u201d  As debt payments climb in 2011, Fernandez plans to draw\n$7.5 billion from foreign  reserves  to cover the obligations, up\nfrom $6.6 billion this year, according to the 2011 federal\nbudget.  Dollar inflows from a record 55 million metric ton soy bean\nharvest this year are helping Argentina offset the payments.\nRegular central bank dollar buying lifted reserves $2.2 billion\nthis year to a record $52.35 billion yesterday.  Record Reserves  \u201cWith the commodities environment and inflows still\nsupportive, Argentina will continue to build reserves,\u201d Suarez\nsaid. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a risk yet, but it\u2019s certainly a\nrisk that\u2019s out there.\u201d  The government has no participation target for the\nreopening offer, which will be managed exclusively by the Buenos\nAires-based Caja de Valores SA and is open to creditors\nworldwide, Lorenzino said in the interview.  \u201cEvery bondholder who enters is one lawsuit that gets\ndropped or one less lawsuit in the future,\u201d Lorenzino said.\n\u201cFrom our perspective, that\u2019s positive.\u201d  Creditors including Styrofoam cup magnate  Kenneth Dart  and\nElliott Management Corp., a New York-based hedge fund, are suing\nArgentina in international courts for repayment of the debt.  Elliott and Dart  Switzerland\u2019s foreign ministry will decide whether a $1\nbillion claim by Elliott\u2019s NML Capital Ltd. and Dart\u2019s EM Ltd.\non Argentine assets at Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for\nInternational Settlements, is admissible, Zurich-based newspaper\nTages-Anzeiger reported today.  \u201cThis is an ongoing process on which we are unable to\nprovide detailed information,\u201d Adrian Sollberger, a Foreign\nMinistry spokesman, told Bloomberg by e-mail from the capital,\nBern. BIS spokeswoman  Marisa Bourtin  also declined to comment.  The new offer, for which $6.1 billion of bonds are\neligible, closes on Dec. 30, according to a resolution in\nyesterday\u2019s official gazette. Creditors holding about $4 billion\nof securities are seeking full repayment through lawsuits,\nLorenzino said. Prior to the June exchange, former President\n Nestor Kirchner  restructured about 75 percent of the debt in\n2005.  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 3.977 at 3:23 p.m. New York\ntime. It\u2019s down 4.5 percent this year.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the government\u2019s\ndollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 5 basis points\nto 490, according to JPMorgan.  Default Swaps  The cost of insuring Argentine bonds against default for\nfive years fell 12 basis points yesterday to 606, according to\nCMA DataVision. Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in\nexchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent\nshould a government or company fail to comply with debt\nagreements.  The year-end swap bid is unlikely to resolve Argentina\u2019s\ndefault, said  Arturo Porzecanski , an international finance\nprofessor at American University in Washington. The proposal may\nhave been requested by investors who missed the June deadline,\nhe said.  \u201cIt won\u2019t cure the default because the bulk of the\nbondholders who didn\u2019t enter has consolidated into a hard core\nof litigants who have judgments and have won lawsuits,\u201d\nPorzecanski said in a telephone interview.
