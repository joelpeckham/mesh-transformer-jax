 "context": "The following article called 'QNB Last Credible Buyer for Denizbank as Bank Sales Founder' was published on 2012-01-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nQatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK)  is the last\nserious bidder for Turkey\u2019s  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  after the withdrawal of\n HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , people familiar with the\nprocess said, underscoring the difficulty banks face offloading\nbusinesses amid  Europe \u2019s sovereign debt crisis.  QNB remains interested in Denizbank, the Turkish unit of\nthe Franco-Belgian lender  Dexia SA (DEXB) , and a deal could be reached\nthis month if talks are successful, the people said. The parties\nmay still fail to complete a deal, one of the people said,\ndeclining to be identified because the discussions are private.  Denizbank is the latest bank asset to struggle to find\nbuyers as the region\u2019s fiscal woes continue and some of the\nworld\u2019s largest financial institutions seek to raise cash by\ndivesting units and portfolios. Lenders including Deutsche Bank\nAG and  France \u2019s Societe Generale SA have announced plans to shed\nmore than $1 trillion in assets, according to Bloomberg data.  \u201cYou certainly have a deleveraging process going on across\nEurope right now, and it\u2019s an accelerating process\u201d as banks\nwork to meet deadlines for raising capital later this year, said\nMatthew Czepliewicz, an analyst at  Collins Stewart  in  London .  With few large financial institutions in a position to make\nmajor acquisitions, that leaves buyers who \u201caren\u2019t the usual\nsuspects,\u201d such as Middle Eastern banks, among the only\ncandidates willing and able to do deals, he added.  \u2019Uncertain Market\u2019  HSBC, based in London, has withdrawn its bid for Denizbank,\npeople with knowledge of the process said yesterday, following a\nsimilar decision by Sberbank last month due to what it said were\n\u201cuncertain market conditions.\u201d  \u201cNo official information has come to us from the\ninterested parties about reports and comments in the media,\u201d\nDenizbank said in a filing with the  Istanbul Stock Exchange \ntoday. \u201cThe sale process is continuing.\u201d  Spokesmen for QNB, HSBC and Dexia declined to comment on\nthe Denizbank process.  Denizbank shares rose 9.7 percent to 12.45 new Turkish lira\nat the close in Istanbul after dropping 1.32 percent earlier,\ngiving it a market value of $4.7 billion. The bank\u2019s shares have\ndeclined 22 percent since last year\u2019s high of 16.05 Turkish lira\non October 19. QNB shares dropped 5.2 percent to close at 145\nriyals, the steepest fall in more than two years amid a broader\nslump on the Doha exchange.  Autumn Rescue  The Turkish lender was put up for sale last autumn as part\nof a rescue plan undertaken by the French and Belgian\ngovernments for Dexia after the debt crisis reduced the bank\u2019s\nability to obtain funding. The Brussels-based firm is putting\nits most troubled assets into a so-called bad bank and trying to\nsell profitable units, including Denizbank, to raise cash.  Turkey  has been a popular target for deals in recent years\nas foreign companies look to tap its $735 billion economy, which\ngrew 8.2 percent in the third quarter of last year -- a pace\nfaster than that of any Group of 20 country except  China .  Still, even bank assets in faster-growing economies are\nmore difficult to sell as buyers stick to the sidelines. Last\nmonth Banco Commercial Portugues opted to keep its Polish unit\nafter initiating a sale process that people familiar with the\nprocess said had seen bidders drop out.  European banks will need to raise 114.7 billion euros in\ncapital as part of measures introduced in response to the\nregion\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis, the European Banking Authority\nsaid last month, 8 billion euros more than the regulator had\nestimated in October.  The agency has given the region\u2019s lenders until June 30 to\nincrease core Tier 1 capital, a measure of banks\u2019 financial\nresilience, to 9 percent as a buffer against the sovereign-debt\ncrisis. The EBA set a Jan. 20 deadline for banks to submit\nmoney-raising plans to supervisors. Those that fail to raise\nenough capital on their own will have to turn to their\ngovernments or the European Financial Stability Facility, the\neuro region\u2019s bailout fund.
