 "context": "The following article called 'Japan Inc. Cashes in on Abenomics as Toyota Profit to Rise' was published on 2013-07-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s economic recovery plan is filling the coffers of manufacturers from  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to  Sony Corp. (6758)   As the exporters prepare to announce first-quarter  earnings  this week, 14 of  Japan \u2019s 27 largest are projected to beat their own full-year operating profit forecasts by 5 percent or more, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income may surge 75 percent from a year earlier among companies that sell abroad and 33 percent at domestic-oriented firms, UBS AG said this month.  Abe\u2019s drive to end 15 years of deflation in Japan through monetary easing and fiscal stimulus benefited manufacturers as the  yen  dropped 5 percent against the dollar last quarter and about 20 percent in the past 12 months, boosting earnings from overseas. Toyota, the world\u2019s largest carmaker, may exceed its fiscal-year net income target by 21 percent, according to the average of 23 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cAbe introduced a real bullet,\u201d said Ichiro Takamatsu, a  fund manager  in  Tokyo  at Bayview Asset Management Co. \u201cCompanies will report stronger numbers because of the weak yen.\u201d  Toyota, set to report earnings on Aug. 2, may say first-quarter net income rose 48 percent to 430 billion yen ($4.3 billion), according to the average of four analyst  estimates . Profit for the year ending March may jump 72 percent to 1.66 trillion yen, based on 23 projections.  Sony, Japan\u2019s biggest smartphone maker, may boost full-year profit 28 percent to 55 billion yen, according to the average of 16  analyst  estimates. The Tokyo-based company will report first-quarter earnings on Aug. 1.  Return Favor  Toyota fell 4.1 percent to 5,900 yen at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo, trimming its gain to 47 percent this year, as Japan\u2019s currency gained to a one-month high against the  U.S. dollar  amid concern about slowing growth in the world\u2019s biggest economies, boosting demand for haven assets. Sony shares, which have more than  doubled  this year, declined 3.6 percent to 2,057 yen. Japan\u2019s broader Topix index fell 3.3 percent.  One question is whether those benefiting from Abenomics will return the favor to stimulate the broader economy. Companies such as Toyota, after stockpiling cash, could bolster Abe\u2019s stimulus efforts by increasing  capital investment , wages and dividends.  \u201cCompanies are of course happy to receive the windfall from a weaker yen and stronger exports, but extremely reluctant to spread this additional income,\u201d said  Martin Schulz , an economist at Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo. \u201cThey would rather keep that income and focus on investment, particularly overseas.\u201d  Weaker Yen  Analysts expect exporters including Toyota and Sony to beat their forecasts in part because the yen is trading at lower levels than the companies predicted.  Toyota said in May it expects 1.37 trillion yen in annual profit, based on exchange rates of 90 yen to the dollar and 120 yen against the euro. Sony targets 50 billion yen in full-year net income based on the same projected rates.  Japan\u2019s currency traded at an average of about 99 against the dollar and 129 against the euro in the quarter ended June 30, compared with about 80 yen and 103 yen a year earlier. The currency may weaken further to 120 yen against the dollar over the next year, Credit Suisse AG said in a July 1 report.  Toyota\u2019s operating profit is boosted by about 40 billion yen for every 1-yen weakening in the Japanese currency against the dollar, according to the company.  \u2018Good Numbers\u2019  \u201cWe are just at the starting lines toward sustainable growth,\u201d  Akio Toyoda , the carmaker\u2019s president, said last month at the annual shareholder\u2019s meeting. He said the strong yen was \u201cbecoming corrected.\u201d  Shino Yamada, a spokeswoman for Toyota, and Mami Imada, a spokeswoman at Sony, declined to comment ahead of the companies\u2019 earnings announcements.  \u201cThere should be many sectors that will benefit from the yen\u2019s depreciation,\u201d said Masamitsu Ohki, a fund manager at Stats Investment Management Co., a hedge fund in Tokyo. \u201cI expect good numbers for the first quarter.\u201d  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan\u2019s second-biggest carmaker, said July 25 it increased profit 14 percent to 82 billion yen in the three months ended June, amid the weaker yen and higher U.S. sales. The Yokohama-based company reiterated its forecast for full-year net income of 420 billion yen.  Panasonic, Honda  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , Japan\u2019s third-biggest TV maker, may post full-year net income of 59 billion yen, compared with the company\u2019s forecast of 50 billion yen, according to the average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Osaka-based company, which reports first-quarter earnings on July 31, had a 754 billion-yen loss last fiscal year.  Annual profit at Tokyo-based  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan\u2019s third-largest carmaker, may jump 70 percent to 624 billion yen, according to the average of 20  estimates .  Carmakers may get a bigger boost from the weaker yen than electronics manufacturers, said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive officer at Tokyo-based Myojo Asset Management Japan Co.  \u201cConsumer electronics makers see a limited impact,\u201d Kikuchi said. \u201cThey have high ratios of overseas production as well as overseas sales.\u201d  PlayStation 4  Sony\u2019s operating  profit  is reduced by a weaker yen against the dollar, while it\u2019s increased by a weaker yen against the euro, according to the company.  One product where Sony is hurt by the weakening currency is its new PlayStation 4 game console. The electronics maker has signed contracts to pay for parts in dollars, to avoid being hurt by the strengthening yen. The result is that parts and production are becoming more expensive just as the company prepares to compete in consoles against  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)   Japanese electronics makers continue to suffer from competition against  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and from the emergence of smartphones and tablet computers, which are eroding demand for devices such as cameras and video-game consoles.  \u201cIn electronics, Japanese companies are extremely challenged by competition in  Asia ,\u201d Schulz at Fujitsu said. \u201cThe overall demand is not strong.\u201d  Canon, Nintendo  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world\u2019s biggest camera maker, cut its full-year forecast July 24, citing lower-than-expected demand.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , the creator of \u201c Super Mario ,\u201d may miss its 55 billion-yen profit forecast for the year ending March, according to analyst estimates. The Kyoto-based company, which fell short of initial sales projections for its new Wii U game console, may post net income of 53 billion yen, according to the average of 22 estimates. The company will report first-quarter earnings on July 31.  A sustained recovery for Japan\u2019s economy will depend on whether Abe\u2019s government can execute a more comprehensive growth strategy, Masayoshi Son, president of  SoftBank Corp. (9984) , said in Tokyo on July 23.  \u201cMonetary initiatives or monetary techniques will not suffice in the long run,\u201d said Son, whose Tokyo-based mobile-phone company acquired U.S. carrier  Sprint Corp. (S)  earlier this month. \u201cUnless Japan grows, all of those short-term initiatives will have no meaning.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story: Ma Jie in Tokyo at  jma124@bloomberg.net ; Naoko Fujimura in Tokyo at  nfujimura@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael Tighe at  mtighe4@bloomberg.net ; Young-Sam Cho at  ycho2@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 12.341519355773926 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
