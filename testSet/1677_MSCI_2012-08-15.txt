 "context": "The following article called 'Russia\u2019s Industry Growth Reaches Two-Month High, Beats Forecasts' was published on 2012-08-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRussian  industrial production  grew\nat the fastest pace in two months in July, beating economist\nforecasts as manufacturing accelerated.  Output at factories, mines and utilities expanded 3.4\npercent from a year earlier, up from 1.9 percent in June, the\nFederal Statistics Service in Moscow said by e-mail today. The\nmedian of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg  survey  was for 2.5 percent\ngrowth. Manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace since\nFebruary.  The economy of the world\u2019s largest energy exporter is\nweathering the debt crisis in the euro area, which accounts for\nabout half of its trade, with domestic demand powering growth of\n4 percent from a year earlier in the second quarter. Indicators\nof sentiment among Russian producers and consumers remain\n\u201cfairly positive,\u201d the central bank said Aug. 10.  \u201cDomestic demand remains exceptionally strong, mainly\nbecause budget policy served as a stimulus at the start of the\nyear,\u201d Alexey Pogorelov, an economist at Credit Suisse AG in\nMoscow, said before the report.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks fell 1.8 percent to 1,435.93\nas of 3:32 p.m. in Moscow. The ruble-denominated benchmark gauge\nhas advanced 2.4 percent this year, lagging behind a 6.2 percent\ngain for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  Manufacturing saw the biggest advance in July, with output\ngrowing 5.7 percent from a year earlier, up from 3.4 in June,\nthe service said. Production at mines advanced 0.9 percent in\nJuly, from 0.2 percent in June. Output growth at utilities\nslowed to 0.8 percent from 2.1 percent in June.  GM, Volkswagen  Sales of cars and light commercial vehicles grew 14 percent\nin July, matching the fastest pace since February, according to\nthe Association of European Businesses in  Russia . Foreign brands\nsuch as  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) \nposted the biggest advances, while OAO AvtoVAZ\u2019s Lada had a 7\npercent decline in sales from a year ago.  OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , Russia\u2019s largest miner, reduced\nsecond-quarter output of nickel by 8 percent from the previous\nquarter, the company said July 30 in a statement. U.S.\nsteelmaker  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  predicted last month that growth would be\nslower in Russia as European demand remains uncertain and prices\nare low.  Economic output in the euro region contracted 0.2 percent\nin the second quarter. That, together with slowing growth in\nChina, will constrain Russian industry, said Vladimir Miklashevsky, a Helsinki-based economist at  Danske Bank A/S. (DANSKE)   \u2018Only Support\u2019  \u201cThe only support may come from manufacturing industries\nwhich are oriented toward domestic consumers,\u201d he said by e-\nmail before the release. Companies such as carmakers and food\nproducers focused on the local market will probably be the\nstrongest performers, he said.  The central bank left  interest rates  unchanged for an\neighth month on Aug. 10, saying monetary conditions had\ntightened and factors outside its control were spurring\ninflation.  Policy makers said in their statement a slowdown in\nindustrial production last month doesn\u2019t pose a risk of a\nbroader economic deceleration because second-quarter\nmanufacturing growth was strong.
