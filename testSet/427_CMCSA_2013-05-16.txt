The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAlcatel-Lucent SA (ALU)  lost its appeals\ncourt bid to revive patent-infringement claims against\n Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK)  and Newegg Inc. over online shopping in an\neffort to increase its royalties.  Overstock.com and Newegg won a jury verdict in 2011 that\nthey didn\u2019t infringe three Alcatel-Lucent patents and that one\nof the patents was invalid. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the\nFederal Circuit in  Washington , without issuing a formal opinion,\nupheld the decision in a notice posted on the court\u2019s website.  The appeal focused on patent 5,649,131, which covers a way\nto exchange information with multiple users. That patent was\nfound to be invalid.  The decision could be a boon to other retailers, including\nBarnes & Noble Inc., which is challenging this and other e-commerce patents owned by Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent. Companies\nincluding Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. settled before the\n2011 trial.  In the 2009 case filed in federal court in Tyler,  Texas ,\nAlcatel-Lucent was seeking $6 million from Salt Lake City-based\nOverstock.com, a discount retailer, and $12.4 million from\nclosely held Newegg, which sells consumer electronics and\ncomputers.  This is the second time Newegg, based in City of Industry,\n California , won a patent-infringement case that has helped other\nInternet retailers. In January, the Federal Circuit threw out a\n$2.5 million verdict Newegg lost and invalidated patents owned\nby Soverain Software.  The ruling benefited dozens of companies that had also been\nsued by Soverain, including Oracle Corp., International Business\nMachines Corp., EBay Inc. and Macy\u2019s Inc. Reines, who\nrepresented Newegg in that case as well, said the victory become\nsomething of a marketing tool for the company with its tech-savvy customers.  \u201cI don\u2019t think Newegg took a principled stand for anything\nother than taking a principled stand, but it\u2019s had a wonderful\neffect on their business,\u201d he said.  The new case is Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc. v. Overstock.com\nInc., 12-1629,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit\n(Washington). The lower court case is Alcatel-Lucent USA Inc. v.\nAmazon.com Inc., 09-cv-00422, U.S. District Court, Eastern\nDistrict of Texas (Tyler).  For more patent news, click here.

Copyright  Aereo Asks Judge to Dismiss TV Networks\u2019 Copyright Lawsuit  Aereo Inc., the Barry Diller-backed online TV service,\nasked a federal judge to dismiss copyright infringement claims\nby the broadcast TV networks, which failed to persuade an\nappeals court to shut down its operation.  Aereo requested judgment without a trial from U.S. District\nJudge Alison Nathan in  New York  May 14. The company said that\nthe federal appeals court ruled that the service didn\u2019t violate\nthe networks\u2019 right to public performance of its programming,\nwhich requires a license.  Broadcasters including  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) \u2019s ABC,  Comcast\nCorp. (CMCSA) \u2019s NBC and  CBS Corp. (CBS)  unsuccessfully petitioned the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals in New York to overturn Nathan\u2019s order denying\na preliminary injunction that would have put New York-based\nAereo out of business.  The networks sued Aereo in March 2012, claiming that it\ninfringed copyrights by capturing their over-the-air signals and\nby retransmitting the programming to subscribers on computers\nand smartphones. Aereo\u2019s transmissions are public performances\nand require licenses, they said. Its service would devalue their\nprogramming and cut viewership, jeopardizing revenue from\nadvertisers and pay-TV providers, according to the networks.  Last week Aereo sued CBS to prevent the network from\nattempting to shut down the service in cities other than New\nYork. Since the appeals court ruling on April 1, Aereo announced\nplans to expand its service to Boston and Atlanta.  The TV networks have petitioned the full U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the Second Circuit to review the decision last month\nby two of three judges who heard arguments in the case.  The cases are American Broadcasting Cos. v. Aereo, 1:12-cv-01540, and WNET v. Aereo, 1:12-cv-01543, U.S. District Court,\nSouthern District of New York (Manhattan).
