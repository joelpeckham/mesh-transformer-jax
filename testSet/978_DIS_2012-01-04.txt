 "context": "The following article called 'Netflix Surges Most in a Year on Jump in Online Viewing' was published on 2012-01-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNetflix Inc. (NFLX) , owner of the streaming\nand DVD-by-mail service, jumped the most in almost a year after\nreporting online viewing that surpassed an analyst\u2019s estimate.  Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, gained 11 percent\nto $80.45 at the close in New York, the  biggest gain (SPX)  among S&P\n500 members. The shares rose the most since a 15 percent advance\non Jan. 27, 2011.  Users of the company\u2019s online movie and TV-streaming\nservice watched more than 2 billion hours of content in the last\nthree months of 2011, Netflix said today in a statement.  The number exceeded the 1.2 billion-hour estimate of  Rich Greenfield , an analyst with BTIG LLC in  New York . Netflix Chief\nExecutive Officer Reed Hastings in December said fourth-quarter\nstreaming hours would be \u201cwell over\u201d 1 billion.  \u201cIt now appears our interpretation was far too\nconservative,\u201d Greenfield wrote in a blog post.  Netflix would be the 15th most-watched U.S. TV network when\ncompared to traditional cable and broadcast channels, Greenfield\nestimates. The company has more than 20 million streaming\nmembers globally.  At $7.99 a month, Netflix\u2019s online service is eating into\ntraditional television viewing, Greenfield said.  Hastings, 51, said on Dec. 6 that Netflix sees no quick\nreturn to profitability after alienating customers with changes\nin pricing and subscription terms. The company forecasts losses\nfor 2012 because of costs to start service in the U.K. and\nIreland.  New Shows  The company is adding to its streaming library to keep\nusers and restart growth, including current movies such as\n\u201cHugo\u201d and \u201cMargin Call,\u201d and is commissioning exclusive\ncontent that competes with premium cable channels like Time\nWarner Inc.\u2019s HBO.  \u201cLilyhammer,\u201d starring guitarist and actor Steven Van Zandt of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and Bruce Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band\nas a New York gangster in Norway, premieres on Netflix in the\nU.S., Canada and Latin America on Feb. 6. \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d\nanother original series, also makes its debut this year.  Netflix is set to lose online access to films from  Sony\nPictures (SNE)  and  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  after its contract with John Malone\u2019s  Starz (LSTZA)  LLC cable network ends in February.
