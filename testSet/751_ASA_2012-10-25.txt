The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStatoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway \u2019s biggest oil\nand natural gas producer, may consider a liquified natural gas\nexporting business for its Canadian operations.  \u201cIf there is a business opportunity and it is the right\ntiming then I think we\u2019ll go for it,\u201d Stale Tungesvik,\npresident of Canadian operations, said in an interview in\nCalgary yesterday. \u201cWe have a rather active M&A group looking\nat things. Timing is the key word. We are looking for things\ncontinuously.\u201d  Statoil would be up against larger competitors like  Royal\nDutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Exxon Mobil Corp. that have proposed LNG\noperations in Western  Canada .

The company, based in Stavanger,\nNorway, already has LNG production from the Snohvit gas field in\nthe Norwegian Sea, north of the Arctic Circle.  Statoil plans to \u201coptimize\u201d its existing assets in\nCanada, said Tungesvik, who was appointed to lead the Canadian\ndivision two months ago. Production at Statoil\u2019s oil-sands\noperations in Alberta is about 20,000 barrels a day and the\ncompany plans to double that figure, he said without providing a\ntime frame.
