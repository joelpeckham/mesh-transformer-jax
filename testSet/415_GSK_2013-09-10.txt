 "context": "The following article called 'Glaxo-Theravance Lung Drug Wins U.S. Panel Recommendation' was published on 2013-09-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  and  Theravance\nInc. (THRX) \u2019s lung drug Anoro Ellipta won the backing of a U.S.\nadvisory panel as the companies strive to gain marketing\napproval of their new combination pill ahead of competitors.  The safety and efficacy data provide substantial evidence\nto support regulatory clearance of the treatment for chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disorder, advisers to the  Food and Drug\nAdministration  voted 11-2 today in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland . The\nFDA is expected to decide whether to approve the combination\ntreatment by Dec. 18.  The companies, which won FDA clearance in May for Breo\nEllipta, are trying to get Anoro Ellipta to market before other\nsimilar combination-ingredient drugs to treat COPD, an umbrella\nterm for emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Anoro is expected to\ngenerate $1.4 billion in sales in 2017, according to the average\nof nine analysts\u2019  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cThe safety and efficacy of the drug has been adequately\ndemonstrated,\u201d  Francis McCormack , a panel member and director\nof the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine\nat the University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, said after\nthe vote. \u201cWe are in desperate need of additional options in\nthis category.\u201d  Panel members agreed the FDA should require post-market\nstudies of Anoro on more severe COPD patients who weren\u2019t\nincluded in original trials and to further assess what appeared\nto be imbalances in cardiovascular risk demonstrated in the\ntrials.  Label Warnings  The companies have proposed labeling that includes a\nwarning for patients with cardiovascular disease. FDA staff\nmembers said Anoro showed strong efficacy in a  report  ahead of\nthe meeting though they raised concerns patients may be at risk\nof cardiovascular issues.  London-based Glaxo and South San Francisco-based Theravance\nsought approval for two dose levels of Anoro, while the FDA only\nasked the panel to consider the lower one. The companies expect\nonly one of the doses to be approved, Michael Aguiar, chief\nfinancial officer at Theravance, said in an interview.  Anoro is a combination of vilanterol, a long-acting beta\nagonist or LABA, and umeclidinium, a long-acting muscarinic\nantagonist or LAMA, used with London-based Glaxo\u2019s Ellipta\ninhaler. Breo\u2019s active ingredient is vilanterol.  Advisers considered an Anoro dose of 62.5 micrograms of\numeclidinium and 25 micrograms of vilanterol. Each ingredient\nworks through different mechanisms to open airways.  Breo is expected by analysts to have sales of $1.6 billion\nin 2017. Theravance will earn tiered royalties of 6.5 percent to\n10 percent on Anoro sales if the drug is approved, Aguiar said.  Pfizer Drug  Glaxo and Theravance tested Anoro against  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and\n Boehringer Ingelheim  GmbH\u2019s Spiriva and vilanterol alone.\n Novartis AG (NOVN)  is researching a LABA/LAMA combination for COPD\ncalled QVA149. Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis said in July\nthat it expects to file for U.S. approval at the end of 2014.  Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX)  and Almirall SA, as well as\nBoehringer Ingelheim and AstraZeneca Plc also are studying\nLABA/LAMA combinations.  Theravance said in April it would split into two companies\nat the end of this year or early 2014. One of the companies will\nbe called Royalty Management Co. and will focus on the Glaxo\ncollaboration, while the other, Theravance Biopharma, will focus\non developing drugs. Glaxo is the largest shareholder of\nTheravance with 27 percent of the stock.
