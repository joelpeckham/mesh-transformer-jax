The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNet earnings per share of $1.60; includes $0.82 per share in realized losses on securities after adopting new accounting standard related to equity securities previously classified as \u201cavailable for sale\u201d Core net operating earnings of $2.42 per share, an increase of 43% from the prior year period First quarter annualized ROE of 12.3%; core operating ROE of 18.6% Announced special cash dividend of $1.50 per share, payable May 25, 2018 Full year 2018 core net operating earnings guidance maintained at $7.90 - $8.40 per share\nCINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: AFG) today reported 2018 first quarter net earnings attributable to shareholders of $145 million ($1.60 per share) compared to $153 million ($1.72 per share) for the 2017 first quarter. Effective January 1, 2018, AFG adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which requires all equity securities previously classified as \u201cavailable for sale\u201d to be reported at fair value, with holding gains and losses recognized in net earnings \u2013 see Investments and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards, below. Net earnings for the quarter include $74 million ($0.82 per share) in after-tax net realized losses on securities, including $71 million ($0.78 per share) in holding losses to adjust equity securities to fair value. By comparison, after-tax net realized gains on securities were $2 million ($0.03 per share) in the prior year period. The change in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and effective January 1, 2018, contributed to a lower effective tax rate in 2018 as compared to 2017. Book value per share was $58.32 as of March 31, 2018. Annualized return on equity was 12.3% and 13.3% for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCore net operating earnings were $219 million ($2.42 per share) for the 2018 first quarter, compared to $151 million ($1.69 per share) in the 2017 first quarter. The improved results were attributable to higher operating earnings in our Specialty Property and Casualty (P&C) Insurance operations and our Annuity Segment and the benefit of the lower corporate income tax rate. Book value per share, excluding unrealized gains related to fixed maturities, was $54.74 per share at March 31, 2018, up from $53.51 per share at December 31, 2017. Core net operating earnings for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 generated annualized returns on equity of 18.6% and 13.1%, respectively.\nThe Company also announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a special cash dividend of $1.50 per share of American Financial Group common stock. The dividend is payable on May 25, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 15, 2018. The aggregate amount of this special dividend will be approximately $133 million. This special dividend is in addition to the Company\u2019s regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share most recently paid on April 25, 2018.\nAFG\u2019s net earnings attributable to shareholders, determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), include certain items that may not be indicative of its ongoing core operations. The table below identifies such items and reconciles net earnings attributable to shareholders to core net operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure. AFG believes that its core net operating earnings provides management, financial analysts, ratings agencies and investors with an understanding of the results from the ongoing operations of the Company by excluding the impact of net realized gains and losses and other special items that are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. AFG\u2019s management uses core net operating earnings to evaluate financial performance against historical results because it believes this provides a more comparable measure of its continuing business. Core net operating earnings is also used by AFG\u2019s management as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting.\nIn millions, except per share amounts Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 Components of net earnings attributable to shareholders: Core operating earnings before income taxes $ 267 $ 220 Pretax non-core item: Realized gains (losses) on securities (93 ) 3 Earnings before income taxes 174 223 Provision (credit) for income taxes: Core operating earnings 52 67 Non-core item: Realized gains (losses) on securities (19 ) 1 Total provision (credit) for income taxes 33 68 Net earnings, including noncontrolling interests 141 155 Less net earnings (losses) attributable to noncontrolling interests: Core operating earnings (4 ) 2 Realized gains (losses) on securities - - Total net earnings (losses) attributable to noncontrolling interests (4 ) 2 Net earnings attributable to shareholders $ 145 $ 153 Net earnings: Core net operating earnings (a) $ 219 $ 151 Realized gains (losses) on securities (74 ) 2 Net earnings attributable to shareholders $ 145 $ 153 Components of Earnings Per Share: Core net operating earnings (a) $ 2.42 $ 1.69 Realized gains (losses) on securities (0.82 ) 0.03 Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 1.60 $ 1.72 Footnote (a) is contained in the accompanying Notes to Financial Schedules at the end of this release.\nS. Craig Lindner and Carl H. Lindner III, AFG\u2019s Co-Chief Executive Officers, commented: \u201cThe year is off to a very strong start, with core operating earnings establishing an all-time quarterly high for AFG. Our Specialty P&C insurance operations generated excellent underwriting margins, and earnings in our Annuity Segment were outstanding.\n\u201cAFG had approximately $845 million of excess capital (including parent company cash of approximately $280 million) at March 31, 2018. Where appropriate, our excess capital will be deployed into AFG\u2019s core businesses as we identify potential for healthy, profitable organic growth, and opportunities to expand our specialty niche businesses through acquisitions and start-ups that meet our target return thresholds. In addition, returning capital to shareholders in the form of regular and special cash dividends and opportunistic share repurchases are also an important and effective component of our capital management strategy. The $1.50 per share special cash dividend announced today reflects AFG\u2019s strong financial position and our confidence in the Company\u2019s financial future.\n\u201cWe continue to expect core net operating earnings in 2018 to be between $7.90 and $8.40 per share. Our core earnings per share guidance excludes non-core items such as realized gains and losses, as well as other significant items that are not able to be estimated with reasonable precision, or that may not be indicative of ongoing operations.\u201d\nSpecialty Property and Casualty Insurance Operations\nCore operating earnings in AFG\u2019s P&C insurance operations were $188 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $169 million in the prior year period, an increase of 11%. Higher P&C underwriting profit and higher P&C net investment income were partially offset by lower year-over-year other income.\nThe Specialty P&C insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $92 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $79 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 16%. Higher underwriting profit in our Specialty Casualty Group was partially offset by lower underwriting profit in our Property and Transportation and Specialty Financial Groups.\nThe first quarter 2018 combined ratio of 91.7% improved 0.5% from the prior year period. First quarter 2018 results include 5.1 points of favorable prior year reserve development, compared to 2.8 points of favorable development in the comparable prior year period. Catastrophe losses were 1.2 points of the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2018; by comparison, catastrophe losses added 0.7 points in the prior year period.\nGross and net written premiums were up 10% and 7%, respectively, in the 2018 first quarter compared to the same quarter a year earlier, with each of our Specialty P&C groups reporting growth during the quarter. Average renewal pricing across our entire P&C Group was up less than 1% for the quarter. Excluding our workers\u2019 compensation business, renewal pricing was up approximately 3%. Further details about AFG\u2019s Specialty P&C operations may be found in the accompanying schedules.\nThe Property and Transportation Group reported an underwriting profit of $33 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $43 million in the first quarter of 2017. Higher underwriting profits in our agricultural businesses were more than offset by lower underwriting profit in our transportation and property & inland marine businesses. Catastrophe losses in this group were $5 million in both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 gross written premiums in this group were 2% higher than the comparable prior year period, while net written premiums were flat year-over-year. The growth in gross written premiums is primarily attributable to new business opportunities in our property & inland marine and transportation businesses. Higher cessions of crop insurance impacted net written premiums. Overall renewal rates in this group increased 4% in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Specialty Casualty Group reported an underwriting profit of $41 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $15 million in the comparable 2017 period. Higher profitability in our workers\u2019 compensation and executive liability businesses, primarily attributed to higher prior year favorable reserve development, as well as higher year-over-year underwriting profit in our excess & liability lines, were the drivers of the improved results. Catastrophe losses for this group were $5 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $1 million in the comparable 2017 period.\nGross and net written premiums for the first quarter of 2018 were up 15% and 10%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily as a result of growth within Neon. Higher premiums in our executive liability and targeted markets businesses also contributed to growth during the quarter. Neon continues to purchase a significant reinsurance program, which impacted year-over-year growth in net written premium. Renewal pricing for this group was down 1% during the first quarter. Excluding rate decreases in our workers\u2019 compensation businesses, renewal rates in this group were up 2%.\nThe Specialty Financial Group reported an underwriting profit of $15 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $22 million in the comparable 2017 period. The decrease was driven primarily by lower underwriting profitability in our financial institutions business. Catastrophe losses for this group were $3 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a $1 million in the prior year quarter.\nFirst quarter 2018 gross and net written premiums were up 9% and 5%, respectively, when compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of higher premiums in our lender services and leasing businesses, which were largely ceded. Renewal pricing in this group was up approximately 2% for the quarter.\nCarl Lindner III stated, \"Each of our Specialty P&C insurance groups reported strong underwriting margins in the first quarter, and we achieved solid year-over-year growth in net written premiums overall. I\u2019m especially pleased by the performance of our workers\u2019 compensation businesses as we start the year. Based on results during the first quarter, we continue to expect an overall 2018 calendar year combined ratio in the range of 92% to 94% and net written premium growth between 3% and 7%.\u201d\nFurther details about AFG\u2019s Specialty P&C operations may be found in the accompanying schedules and in our Quarterly Investor Supplement, which is posted on our website.\nAnnuity Segment\nAs shown in the following table, AFG's Annuity Segment reported $125 million in pretax earnings in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $96 million in the first quarter of 2017. Earnings before the impact of fair value accounting for fixed-indexed annuities (FIAs) were $112 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period.\nComponents of Annuity Earnings Before Income Taxes\nDollars In millions Three months ended Pct. March 31, Change 2018 2017 Annuity earnings before fair value accounting for FIAs $ 112 $ 98 14% Impact of fair value accounting for FIAs:\nInterest accreted on embedded derivative (7 ) (3 ) nm Renewal option costs lower (higher) than expected (4 ) 2 nm Other changes in fair value 24 (1 ) nm\nPretax annuity earnings $ 125 $ 96 30%\nAnnuity Earnings Before Fair Value Accounting for FIAs \u2013 Annuity earnings before fair value accounting for FIAs of $112 million in the first quarter of 2018 established a new all-time high for the Annuity Segment. Quarterly average annuity investments and reserves both grew 10% year-over-year. In addition, the Annuity Segment earned unusually high returns on certain private equity and limited partnership investments, which is not necessarily expected to be recurring. The benefit of these items was partially offset by the runoff of higher-yielding investments.\nImpact of Fair Value Accounting for FIAs \u2013 Under GAAP, a portion of the reserves for FIAs ($2.5 billion and $2.0 billion at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, respectively) is considered an embedded derivative and is recorded at fair value based on the estimated present value of certain expected future cash flows. Assumptions used in calculating this fair value include projected interest rates, option costs, surrenders, withdrawals and mortality. Variances from these assumptions, as well as changes in the stock market, will generally result in a change in fair value. Some of these adjustments are not economic in nature for the current reporting period, but rather impact the timing of reported results.\nThe impact of fair value accounting for FIAs includes an expense for annuity interest accreted on the FIA embedded derivative reserve. The amount of interest accreted in any period is generally based on the size of the embedded derivative and current short-term interest rates.\n\u201cOther Changes in Fair Value\u201d of $20 million in the first quarter of 2018 reflects the benefit of significantly higher than expected interest rates, partially offset by higher than expected option costs for the Company\u2019s FIA liabilities and the impact of a decrease in the stock market. By comparison, during the first quarter of 2017, the negative impact of lower than expected interest rates was more than offset by the benefit of a higher stock market and certain other items. For an analysis of fair value accounting, see our Quarterly Investor Supplement, which is posted on AFG\u2019s website.\nAFG\u2019s Annuity Segment reported statutory premiums of $1.15 billion in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.29 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Higher premiums in the retail channel were more than offset by lower premiums in the financial institutions channel. However, premiums in the first quarter of 2018 represent a 26% increase from sales reported in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting growth in all product lines and channels.\nCraig Lindner stated, \u201cI am pleased that 2018 is off to a strong start for the Annuity Segment. We remain committed to achieving appropriate returns on new business, and believe that our investment skills and consumer-centric product strategy position us well to respond to changing market conditions and consumer demand. While our 2018 first quarter earnings were outstanding, we do not anticipate a recurrence of certain items that favorably impacted the quarter, including the exceptionally high returns on certain of our investments (which impacted earnings before fair value accounting).\n\u201cFurthermore, we expect to continue to see the negative impact of higher FIA option costs, which impact fair value accounting. We will continue to closely monitor these costs, which have been elevated over the last two quarters. If this trend continues, we will likely need to adjust renewal rates on our inforce indexed annuity policies to help mitigate the higher costs. Our original estimate for 2018 pretax annuity earnings remains unchanged and is in the range of $385 to $425 million.\n\u201cFinally, due to stronger than expected first quarter sales in our Retail channel, we now expect that 2018 full year annuity premiums will be up 6% to 12% when compared to the $4.3 billion sold in 2017, an increase from our original guidance of 2% to 6%.\u201d\nAnnuity Segment 2018 guidance assumes (i) interest rates and the stock market rise moderately from today\u2019s levels, (ii) more normalized income from certain investments required to be marked to market through earnings, and (iii) higher option costs. Fluctuations in the returns on investments, large changes in interest rates and/or the stock market, and higher or lower FIA option costs, as compared to our expectations, could lead to significant positive or negative impacts on the Annuity Segment\u2019s results.\nMore information about premiums and the results of operations for our Annuity Segment may also be found in our Quarterly Investor Supplement.\nInvestments and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\nEffective January 1, 2018, AFG adopted ASU 2016-01, which requires that all equity securities previously classified as \u201cavailable for sale\u201d be reported at fair value, with holding gains and losses recognized in net earnings, instead of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). AFG recorded first quarter 2018 net realized losses on securities of $74 million ($0.82 per share) after tax and after deferred acquisition costs (DAC), which included $71 million ($0.78 per share) in after-tax, after-DAC holding losses to adjust equity securities to fair value. By comparison, AFG recorded net realized gains of $2 million in the comparable 2017 period. The impact to our income statement will vary depending upon the level of volatility in the performance of the securities held in our equity portfolio and the overall market.\nUnrealized gains on fixed maturities were $342 million after tax and after DAC at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $277 million since year end. A net unrealized gain on equity securities of $221 million included in AOCI as of December 31, 2017 was reclassified to retained earnings as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in connection with the adoption of ASU 2016-01, effective January 1, 2018. This reclassification had no impact on net income or overall shareholders\u2019 equity.\nOur portfolio continues to be high quality, with 89% of our fixed maturity portfolio rated investment grade and 98% with a National Association of Insurance Commissioners\u2019 designation of NAIC 1or 2, its highest two categories.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, P&C net investment income was approximately 16% higher than the comparable 2017 period, and included unusually high returns on certain private equity and limited partnership investments.\nIn March 2017, AFG sold a hotel property in Cincinnati that was owned and managed by a subsidiary of Great American Insurance Company. AFG recognized an after-tax gain of $7 million on the sale, which is recorded as \u201cOther Income\u201d and is included in Specialty P&C core operating earnings.\nMore information about the components of our investment portfolio may be found in our Quarterly Investor Supplement, which is posted on our website.\nAbout American Financial Group, Inc.\nAmerican Financial Group is an insurance holding company, based in Cincinnati, Ohio with assets of approximately $60 billion. Through the operations of Great American Insurance Group, AFG is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance, focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses, and in the sale of fixed and fixed-indexed annuities in the retail, financial institutions and education markets. Great American Insurance Group\u2019s roots go back to 1872 with the founding of its flagship company, Great American Insurance Company.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain statements that may be deemed to be \" \" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
