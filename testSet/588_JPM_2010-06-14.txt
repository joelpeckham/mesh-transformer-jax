The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPortugal Telecom SGPS SA  investor\nOngoing Strategy Investments SGPS SA plans to vote against\nselling the company\u2019s stake in a Brazilian joint venture at a\nshareholder meeting this month.  \n \u201cAt this price my answer is clearly no,\u201d Chairman  Nuno Vasconcellos  said in a telephone interview today. The offer\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t reflect Vivo\u2019s strategic value or the benefits\nTelefonica could get from merging a mobile business with\nTelesp,\u201d he said, referring to the Brazilian fixed-line phone\ncompany Madrid-based  Telefonica  controls.  \n Portugal Telecom is asking investors to vote June 30 on an\nincreased 6.5 billion-euro ($8 billion) bid from Telefonica for\nits stake in their venture, which controls Brazil\u2019s largest\nwireless operator,  Vivo Participacoes SA . Ongoing is Portugal\nTelecom\u2019s fourth-biggest investor, with a 6.8 percent stake.  \n Portugal\u2019s biggest phone company rejected an earlier bid of\n5.7 billion euros for its Vivo stake and says the latest offer\nstill doesn\u2019t reflect the benefits  Telefonica  could extract from\nthe takeover. Telefonica says it wants to buy out Vivo\u2019s\nminority investors and merge the wireless company with\nTelecomunicacoes de Sao Paulo SA, or Telesp.  \n Analysts including JPMorgan Cazenove\u2019s  Daniel Morris  and\nBanif Investment Bank\u2019s  Teresa Martinho  said last week the bid\nmay rise by another 500 million euros.  \n \u2018Handful of Nothing\u2019  \n \u201cTelefonica can\u2019t expect us to leave Brazil with a handful\nof nothing,\u201d Vasconcellos said, reiterating his earlier\ncomments that maintaining an operation in Brazil is strategic\nfor Lisbon-based Portugal Telecom. \u201cWe need enough money and\nconditions to go in a different direction,\u201d declining to say\nwhat a fair offer would be.  \n Since 2006, Vivo has overtaken Portugal Telecom\u2019s fixed-\nline unit as the biggest  revenue  contributor, accounting for\nhalf of sales in the first quarter. Brazil sales rose 27 percent\nin the first quarter, while revenue at home fell 3.6 percent.\nThe company also has stakes in other Portuguese-speaking\ncountries such as Angola, Macau and East Timor, though they\nrepresent just 3 percent of total revenue.  \n \u201cThe  board  mandated the chief executive officer and the\nchief financial officer to discuss a better solution for\neveryone,\u201d he said. Vasconcellos said he has no information on\nhow these talks are going.  \n \u201cThe executive board must give investors a clear\nindication on whether Vivo is to be sold at this price or not,\u201d\nsaid Vasconcellos, who is a non-executive board member. \u201cThey\nmust take that responsibility.\u201d  \n CEO  Zeinal Bava  hasn\u2019t issued a recommendation on how\ninvestors should vote at the shareholder meeting, though he has\nsaid repeatedly that Telefonica\u2019s offer doesn\u2019t reflect Vivo\u2019s\nstrategic value.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Anabela Reis  in Lisbon at \n areis1@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 28.0600643157959 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
