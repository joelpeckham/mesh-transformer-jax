(CAH) , the second-\nlargest U.S. drug distributor by revenue, dropped the most in\nalmost four years after the company lost a contract to supply\n Walgreen Co. (WAG) \u2019s pharmacies.  Cardinal fell 8.2 percent to $42.35 at the close in New\nYork, its largest one-day decline since June 2, 2009. The shares\nhave gained 2.7 percent in the past 12 months.  The contract with the largest U.S. drugstore chain expires\nat the end of August and won\u2019t be renewed, Dublin, Ohio-based\nCardinal said today in a statement. The move won\u2019t hurt earnings\nfor the 2013 fiscal year ending in June. Walgreen and Alliance\nBoots GmbH said they agreed to a partnership with\n AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC)  to distribute drugs in a 10-year deal.  \u201cWe anticipate that investors\u2019 sense of urgency to buy\ninto shares could be limited for now,\u201d Thomas Gallucci, an\nanalyst with Lazard Capital Markets in  New York , said in a note\nto clients. Gallucci downgraded his rating on Cardinal\u2019s stock\nto neutral.  Cardinal will target a 2014 diluted earnings per share\nsimilar to its fiscal 2013  forecast  of $3.42 to $3.50 provided\non Feb. 5, George Barrett, the company\u2019s chairman and CEO, said\nin a statement.  \u201cAlthough we are not yet ready to provide fiscal 2014\nearnings guidance, our portfolio has considerable balance and we\nhave prepared strategies to mitigate the impact of\u201d the\nnonrenewal, Barrett said.  Walgreen, based in Deerfield,  Illinois , is one of the drug\ndistributor\u2019s two largest customers and sales to the drugstore\nchain generated about 21 percent of the company\u2019s consolidated\nrevenue for fiscal 2012, Cardinal said.
