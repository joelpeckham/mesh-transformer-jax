(2498)   Asia \u2019s second-biggest\nmaker of smartphones, can tweak the technology in its handsets\nto avoid a U.S. trade agency ban. Dealing with the threat from\n Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) \u2019s new devices may prove\ntougher.  The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Dec. 19\nthat beginning in April it would ban the sale of HTC phones that\ninfringed an Apple patent on so-called data-detection, such as\ntouching a phone number or an address in an e-mail to dial or\nfind the address on a map. HTC responded by saying it will\nremove the offending features from its phones.  Keeping the handsets on the market solves HTC\u2019s immediate\nchallenge after becoming the top selling vendor in the U.S.\nSamsung\u2019s Galaxy Nexus and Apple\u2019s faster, \u2018 Siri \u2019-enabled iPhone\nhit the market within the last quarter, posing a new threat to\nHTC\u2019s place in the $262 billion global mobile-phone market. The\nTaoyuan, Taiwan-based company is forecast to post its slowest\nannual sales-growth and first profit decline since the 2009\neconomic crisis.  \u201cThings were going great at HTC two years ago, their\nproducts were so successful and they were the hottest company in\nmobile phones,\u201d said  Will Stofega , an analyst at researcher IDC\nin Framingham,  Massachusetts . \u201cThey didn\u2019t keep the momentum\ngoing, and now we\u2019re seeing products that haven\u2019t wowed\naudiences as much.\u201d  HTC\u2019s revenue will climb 11 percent next year and profit\nwill drop 6.7 percent, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled\nby Bloomberg, marking its worst financial performance since the\n2009 global economic crisis. HTC\u2019s revenue climbed 50-fold from\n2000 to 2010, according to Bloomberg data.  Sales Guidance  Stiff competition prompted HTC to cut its sales guidance\nfor this quarter by 20 percent, last month. That announcement,\non Nov. 23, prompted the stock to drop by its daily 7 percent\nlimit in Taipei for two consecutive days, worsening the year-to-\ndate loss to 45 percent.  At least six brokers downgraded HTC since the revised\nguidance, with more analysts now recommending investors sell HTC\nthan buy for the first time in at least two years.  HTC Chief Financial Officer Winston Yung didn\u2019t immediately\nreturn calls yesterday.  The ITC, the agency empowered to block imports of products\nthat infringe the patents, found in Apple\u2019s favor for one of\nfour patents the Cupertino, California-based company alleged HTC\nbreached. Apple\u2019s so-called \u2018647 patent covered a feature in\nwhich the phone recognizes a telephone number so it can be\nstored in directories or called without dialing.  Ripping Off IPhone  The result, while less than Apple sought, marks its first\nvictory in patent cases and strengthens the argument that\nGoogle\u2019s Android \u201cripped off the iPhone,\u201d as the company\u2019s\nlate founder,  Steve Jobs , once claimed. The ruling is the first\ndefinitive decision in the dozens of patent cases that began to\nproliferate last year as smartphone makers battle over a market\nthat Strategy Analytics Inc. said increased 44 percent last\nquarter from a year earlier to 117 million phones worldwide.  Apple also has civil patent infringement cases against HTC\nand Samsung. Both Asian rivals have also filed their own\nretaliatory actions to the ITC and in U.S courts. The Android\noperating system has led the global market since last year,\nclimbing to 48 percent of all smart phones in the second quarter\nof this year and ahead of 19 percent for Apple\u2019s iOS platform,\n according to  U.K. researcher Canalys.  Siri  Founded in 1997, HTC used its partnership with  Google (GOOG)  to\nhelp transform itself from a contract manufacturer of Compaq\nComputer Corp.\u2019s iPaq personal digital assistant to the biggest\nU.S. smartphone seller for the first time last quarter. The\ncompany is chaired by  Taiwan \u2019s richest woman, Cher Wang.  Since HTC became the leader in the U.S., Apple and Samsung\nhave replied with newer and more functional devices. Apple sold\na record 4 million units of the iPhone 4S in the product\u2019s first\nweekend beginning Oct. 14. The model features \u2018Siri,\u2019 a software\nthat allows users to ask questions or issue commands by voice.  In October, Samsung unveiled the new Galaxy Nexus that runs\nGoogle\u2019s latest Ice Cream Sandwich software, featuring face-\ndetection technology.  HTC\u2019s relative success in the ITC ruling -- Apple had\nalleged four patents were infringed, with ITC agreeing on only\none --spurred the stock up its daily 7 percent limit in Taipei\nyesterday. Still, analysts say the company needs to change if\nit\u2019s to gain on Apple and Samsung.  \u201cThey need to improve their products and the design which\nhasn\u2019t changed in two years,\u201d said Roxy Wong, who rates HTC\n\u201creduce\u201d at  Mirae Asset Securities Co. (037620)  in  Hong Kong . \u201cI\u2019d\nturn more positive if they became more competitive in their\nprice-performance and design.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nTim Culpan in Taipei at \n tculpan1@bloomberg.net .
