 "context": "The following article called 'Dead Dog in Reservoir Helps Drive Venezuelans to Bottled Water' was published on 2013-09-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe carcass of a dead dog floats on\nthe lake that  supplies  tap water to 750,000 Venezuelans. Witch\ndoctor  Francisco Sanchez  has just dumped the previous night\u2019s\nsacrifice from a cliff, contaminating the resource that has\nbecome more scarce than gasoline in Caracas.  The water from Lake Mariposa, polluted by sacrifices and\ngarbage from a local cult, is pumped to a 60-year-old treatment\nplant that lacks the technology to make it safe for drinking,\nsaid Fernando Morales, an environmental chemistry professor at\nSimon Bolivar University in Caracas who has visited the site.  Eight kilometers (five miles) away from the lake, in\nCaracas, sales of bottled water are booming, with families\npaying the equivalent of $4.80 for a five-gallon jug, twice the\n price  of gasoline.  \u201cThe treatment process has not adapted to the steady\ndegradation of the water source,\u201d Morales said in an interview\nat the university campus Aug. 22. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t use this water at\nhome.\u201d  The socialist revolution implemented by late President  Hugo Chavez  redirected funds from state-owned companies to reduce\npoverty and widen access to education, health-care and housing.\nIt  built  422,340 homes in the past two years, while neglecting\nthe basic services in a country that has the world\u2019s largest oil\ndeposits and eight times more fresh water per capita than\n France . Blackouts and water cuts have become weekly events in\nCaracas, and when water does flow, few dare to drink.  Blackout  The water crisis is the latest hardship affecting\nVenezuelans. When a main pipe  burst  last month, 60 percent of\nthe capital was without water for two days. Yesterday, more than\nhalf of Venezuela was in the dark for several hours when a\ntransmission line accounting for 60 percent of the country\u2019s\nsupply failed.  Shortages of imported goods ranging from sugar to beef are\nstoking the world\u2019s second highest inflation after  Iran . Real\nwages fell 9 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier,\naccording to the central bank. The public-sector deficit will\nfinish the year at 11 percent of gross domestic product,\naccording to  Bank of America  Corp.  The deficit wasn\u2019t used to finance investment in the water\nindustry. The budget of the Caracas water monopoly Hidrocapital\nfell 49 percent to 25 million bolivars ($9.7 million) in 2010,\nthe  last  year the  Environment Ministry  published a detailed\nreport on spending plans.  The yield on benchmark sovereign bonds due 2027 rose 0.11\npercentage point to 12.36 percent on Sept. 3. On average,\nVenezuelan sovereign debt yields 12.48 percent, almost double\nthe average in  emerging markets , according to JPMorgan Chase &\nCo.  Bigger Budget  A year before Chavez came to power, in 1998, state-owned\nHidrocapital had an annual budget of $250 million, according to\nthe company\u2019s former vice president Norberto Bausson.  Environment Ministry spokesman Alejandro Franco and\nInformation Ministry spokesman, who asked not to be named citing\ninternal policy, declined to comment on the supply of tap water\nin Caracas. A spokesman for President Nicolas Maduro, who can\u2019t\nbe named because of internal policy, also declined to comment.  Greater Caracas\u2019 population grew by 800,000 residents to\nabout 5.5 million since the last reservoir or processing plant\nwas built near the city in 1997, said Bausson, who now directs\nwater policy at the opposition alliance Democratic Unity Table.  \u201cNot a drop of water has been added to Caracas\u2019 supply\nsystem in 15 years,\u201d he said from his office last month. \u201cThe\nnetwork is falling apart.\u201d  Water Jugs  Caracas residents pay 30 bolivars ($4.80) for five gallons\nof filtered water delivered in jugs by trucks once a week. The\nsame volume of gasoline costs 14 bolivars, making it the\ncheapest fuel in the world, according to data  compiled  by\nBloomberg.  In the meantime, witch doctor Sanchez, is left free to\npractice his water-polluting rituals.  \u201cNo one is bothering me here at all,\u201d Sanchez, 42, said\nas he prepared a chicken for sacrifice later in the day. \u201cI\nmoved here two years ago because I wanted to get deeper into\nwitchcraft. People come to worship every evening from the\ncity.\u201d  The reservoir was last cleaned four years ago, unearthing\ndozens of animal carcasses, said Inmer Parra, a councilor at the\nLos Salias municipality, home to the lake.  Ten years ago, Mariposa was a sunbathing and sailing\ndestination. Today it is a haven for followers of  Santeria , a\nmix of Christian and West African beliefs, which includes\nworship of Guaicaipuro, a 16th century local American Indian\nchief.  1,000 Valves  Caracas has to pump its water an average of 800 meters\n(2,620 feet) upwards from the six reservoirs supplying the city.\nAn outmoded system of 86 pumping stations is operated by\nmanually turning about 1,000 valves, said Bausson. A breakdown\nin any part causes supply cuts affecting at least one Caracas\nborough every day.  \u201cI have to get up at 4 a.m. to load the washing machine\nwith clothes,\u201d said Bilenis Gonzalez, a 24 year-old babysitter\nfrom Catia neighborhood in western Caracas. \u201cWater stopped\ncoming to my house during the day-time over a year ago.\u201d  President of Hidrocapital, Ernesto Paiva, and Water Vice\nMinister Manuel Regino declined to be interviewed. Regino is\n Venezuela \u2019s fourth Water Vice Minister in 11 months.  \u201cWe can guarantee that the water which reaches your home\nis 100 percent potable,\u201d Hidrocapital  says  on its website.  Living Viruses  The utility\u2019s water treatment is inadequate for the level\nof contamination, said chemistry professor Morales. The chlorine\nthey use kills the organic bacteria, while leaving the viruses\nin the water source unharmed, he said. Getting rid of potential\nviruses would require molecular sieves and modern biological\nmonitoring systems, which don\u2019t exist in Venezuela, Morales\nsaid.  Hidrocapital stopped publishing results of sanitary tests\nlast year, according to Bausson, even as the law says the\ninformation must be available publicly.  The company\u2019s information center doesn\u2019t have water quality\nrecords, said press officer Mayyuly Castellanos. The water\nquality department\u2019s manager Linda Manzanero didn\u2019t respond to a\nphone message and e-mail seeking comment.  The majority of Caracas\u2019 water comes from River Tuy, born\nin the hills of Aragua state about 50 kilometers west of the\ncapital. Until the 1980s, the  valleys  through which Tuy runs\nwere an agricultural zone. Today, it\u2019s an extension of the\nCaracas urban sprawl, collecting the waste of 690,000 residents,\naccording to the 2011 Census.  New Dam  Instead of trying to clean Tuy, the government is building\na dam on River Cuira, which flows through a sparsely populated\nnational park and remains clean, to increase water supply to\nCaracas, according to Morales. The work, which began in May\n2011, has yet to finish, a year after it was scheduled to end.  Diverting water from Cuira won\u2019t guarantee the water\nquality, as much of the contamination occurs after the\nprocessing plant, while water sits in old tanks and then travels\nthrough rotting secondary pipelines to people\u2019s homes, Bausson\nsaid.  The water is provided by private plants from wells and\nmountain streams in Los Teques area near Mariposa. Household\nconsumption of bottled water in Caracas grew 39 percent since\n2010 to reach an average 125 liters a year in June, said Rosibel\nChacin, account manager at market research company Kantar\nWorldpanel.  Price Controls  Price controls and dollar shortages are making the water\nbusiness increasingly difficult, said Kiara Santucci, owner of\n Zenda , the only Los Teques water company to sell five-gallon\njugs that are certified by the government.  Two weeks before the presidential elections on April 14,\nthe government forced Zenda to lower the price of the jug by 26\npercent to 20 bolivars, as it tried to slow inflation that has\nsince quickened to 42.6 percent. A can of Coca Cola costs 15\nbolivars in Caracas.  To stay afloat amid price controls companies are \u201ccutting\ncorners\u201d on filtering, Santucci said by telephone from Los\nTeques Aug. 23. The government doesn\u2019t test bottled water for\nquality, Santucci said.  \u201cI don\u2019t trust the water, including the bottled variety,\u201d\nsaid Nancy  Santa Fe  from the Julian Blanco shantytown in eastern\nCaracas, who was spending her 14th day without running water on\nAug. 23. \u201cEven people in the slums are investing in in-house\nfilters to be on the safe side.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAnatoly Kurmanaev in Bogota at \n akurmanaev1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAndre Soliani at \n asoliani@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 40.55150604248047 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
