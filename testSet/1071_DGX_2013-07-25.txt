 "context": "The following article called 'Cowboys Reach Agreement With AT&T to Name NFL Stadium' was published on 2013-07-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  Dallas  Cowboys and  AT&T Inc. (T) \nreached an agreement to name the National Football League team\u2019s\nstadium after the U.S.\u2019s largest phone company.  The $1.2 billion stadium, home of the league\u2019s most\nvaluable franchise, will become AT&T Stadium, the team said\ntoday in an e-mailed release. AT&T is based in Dallas, 19 miles\n(31 kilometers) away from the four-year-old stadium in Arlington.  \u201cDallas is our hometown, and we\u2019re proud to expand our\nsuccessful relationship with the Cowboys, one of the most\nvisionary sports franchises around,\u201d AT&T Global Marketing\nOfficer Cathy Coughlin said in the release.  AT&T already has its name on two major North American\nsports venues -- baseball\u2019s San Francisco Giants play in  AT&T\nPark  and the National Basketball Association\u2019s San Antonio Spurs\nplay in the  AT&T Center . The company\u2019s sports sponsorship\nportfolio includes a golf tournament on the PGA Tour, a college\nfootball bowl game and Major League Soccer.  The agreement also provides AT&T with \u201csubstantial\u201d\nadvertising opportunities inside and outside the stadium, the\nrelease said. The company and team will work together to improve\nmobile technology in the building, including expanding its Wi-Fi\nnetwork.  Terms of the agreement weren\u2019t disclosed and AT&T spokesman\nBrad Burns declined to comment on financial details.  MetLife Deal  MetLife Inc. (MET)  agreed to a 25-year deal in 2011 to place its\nname on the home of the NFL\u2019s  New York  Giants and Jets. A person\nwith knowledge of the agreement said at the time it was valued\nat $400 million, which at $16 million annually would make it the\nlargest naming-rights deal in league history. The person was\ngranted anonymity because the terms weren\u2019t public. Today,\nMetLife spokesman Shane Winn said that figure was incorrect but\ndeclined to disclose the value of the agreement.  Chuck Costigan, founder of Denver-based  Costigan &\nAssociates LLC , a sponsorship and naming-rights firm, said\ntoday\u2019s deal probably is worth less than what MetLife paid\nbecause Dallas is a smaller television market and the venue\nholds one NFL team, as opposed to two. The league record for a\nsingle-team venue is $11 million a year, which Levi Strauss & Co.\nagreed to pay to put its name on the San Francisco 49ers\u2019 Santa\nClara stadium, which is under construction.  \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that a corporate partner that has\nunique objectives to be reached in that marketplace would not\nfind it to be of a high value,\u201d Costigan said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cGiven the current environment and given how the NFL\nis perceived, this is definitely one of the more premier\nproperties in play.\u201d  Cowboys Stadium  The building, which can hold more than 100,000 people, has\nbeen called Cowboys Stadium since it opened in 2009, replacing\nTexas Stadium. The new venue, which has a retractable roof,\nhosted the Super Bowl in 2011, the National Basketball\nAssociation All-Star Game in 2010, as well as college and high\nschool football, boxing, soccer and concerts. It will host the\nmen\u2019s college basketball finals next year, as well as the first\ncollege football national title game under the new playoff\nsystem in 2015.  The stadium\u2019s first regular-season game in 2009 drew\n105,121 people, a single-game NFL record. Winners of five Super\nBowl titles, the team is worth $2.1 billion, according to Forbes\nMagazine\u2019s  annual valuations , making it the most valuable NFL\nteam, almost double the league average.  \u201cAT&T is an iconic American leader that has guided the\npath of communication in the world for more than 100 years,\u201d\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones said in the release. \u201cWith AT&T we\nare growing our relationship with one of the world\u2019s strongest\nand most innovative companies.\u201d  AT&T had $127.4 billion in revenue in 2012, making it the\nlargest U.S. phone company, and yesterday posted second-quarter\nearnings that fell just shy of analyst estimates.  Today\u2019s news comes on the same day that the Giants,\nDallas\u2019s rival in the National Football Conference East division,\nannounced  Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX)  would assume the naming rights\non their 20-acre practice facility adjacent to MetLife Stadium.
