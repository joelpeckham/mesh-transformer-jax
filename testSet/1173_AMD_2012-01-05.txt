 "context": "The following article called 'Citigroup, MF Global, Gupta, UBS, Chevron in Court News' was published on 2012-01-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCitigroup Inc. (C) \u2019s Singapore unit sued\nHong Kong-based hedge fund manager Raghavendran Rajaraman,\nseeking to recoup $1.03 million in trading losses the bank says\nhe incurred after gold fell from a record high in September.  Rajaraman had $19.2 million worth of gold in his account on\nSept. 23 which the bank sold, along with other collateral, on\nSept. 26 \u201cin the face of a rapidly deteriorating market,\u201d\nleaving a $1 million shortfall, according to a Nov. 18 lawsuit\nfiled with the Singapore High Court. The first closed hearing is\nscheduled for Jan. 27.  Gold plunged 11 percent in September, the most since\nOctober 2008, after futures reached a record $1,923.70 an ounce\non Sept. 6. The bank liquidated Rajaraman\u2019s account after it\nreached a so-called forced sell level and got his authorization,\naccording to court papers. Gold for February delivery in  New\nYork  was at $1,601.30 an ounce at 9:55 a.m. Singapore time.  Rajaraman works with hedge fund 3 Degrees Asset Management\nand was a currency options trader with Citigroup in Singapore\nuntil 2007, according to the lawsuit.  He hasn\u2019t filed his defense and didn\u2019t return three calls\nto his mobile-phone. Richard Healy, Rajaraman\u2019s lawyer at\nOldham, Li & Nie, declined to comment.  \u201cWe intend to pursue the case and it\u2019s inappropriate for\nus to comment further,\u201d said Citigroup\u2019s Singapore-based\nspokesman Adam Abdur Rahman.  Citigroup breached its agreement by closing his account\nwithout prior notice, according to an Oct. 7 letter from Oldham,\nLi & Nie to the bank\u2019s lawyers including William Ong at Allen &\nGledhill LLP.  \u201cAs a direct consequence of the bank\u2019s breach,\u201d Rajaraman\nsuffered a $1.7 million loss, representing his collateral,\naccording to the letter. He incurred a further $1.03 million\nloss as the bank prematurely liquidated the account instead of\nwaiting for 24 hours after the account reached the force-sell\nlevel, Rajaraman\u2019s lawyers said in the letter.  The case is Citibank Singapore Ltd. v Raghavendran\nRajaraman S826/2011 in the Singapore High Court.  Life Partners Sued by SEC for Fraud in Life Settlement Deals  Life Partners Holdings Inc. (LPHI)  and three top executives are\nfacing U.S. regulatory claims that they defrauded shareholders\nby systematically understating risk related to the firm\u2019s\npurchases of life insurance policies.  Jan. 3 the Securities and Exchange Commission said Chairman\nand Chief Executive Officer Brian D. Pardo, President and\nGeneral Counsel R. Scott Peden and Chief Financial Officer David\nM. Martin participated in a scheme that misled investors about\nthe firm\u2019s profit potential.  \u201cThe senior-most executives at Life Partners concealed\nsignificant risks to the business, manipulated financial\nstatements with improper accounting, and knowingly profited from\ntheir misconduct by executing insider trades based on\ninformation that was not available to the public,\u201d David\nWoodcock, director of the SEC\u2019s Fort Worth Regional Office, said\nin a statement Jan. 3.  The company, which buys rights to death benefits from\npolicyholders in exchange for lump-sum payments, knowingly\nunderestimated life expectancies used in transactions from 2007\nto 2011, the SEC said in its  statement . Pardo sold $11.5 million\nof stock and Peden sold shares valued at $300,000 while privy to\ninside information, the agency said.  \u201cIt is very disappointing that the SEC has chosen to\npursue litigation over issues that we believe have no merit and\nfinancial presentation issues that we do not believe are\nmaterial,\u201d Pardo, who owns more than 50 percent of the firm\u2019s\nshares, said in a statement. \u201cWe intend to vigorously defend\nourselves against these meritless claims.\u201d  Calls to the company seeking further comment Jan. 3 and\nyesterday weren\u2019t returned. Peden didn\u2019t respond to a telephone\nmessage left at a residential listing under his name in Woodway,\nTexas. A listing couldn\u2019t be found for Martin.  For more, click here.  Quanta Sues AMD Over Microchips for Notebook Computers  Quanta Computer Inc. (2382) , the world\u2019s largest contract maker of\nnotebook computers, sued  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  for breach\nof contract, alleging the chipmaker sold defective products.  AMD and its ATI Technologies Inc. unit sold chips that\ndidn\u2019t meet heat tolerances and were unfit for particular\npurposes, Taoyuan, Taiwan-based Quanta claimed Jan. 3 in a\nfederal court filing in San Jose, California. The chips were\nused in notebooks Quanta made for  NEC Corp. (6701)  and caused the\ncomputers to malfunction, according to the filing.  \u201cQuanta has suffered significant injury to prospective\nrevenue and profits,\u201d the company said in the complaint. Quanta\nis seeking a jury trial and damages, according to court papers.  \u201cAMD disputes the allegations in Quanta\u2019s complaint and\nbelieves they are without merit,\u201d Sunnyvale, California-based\nAMD\u2019s spokesman, Michael Silverman, said in an e-mailed message.  \u201cAMD is aware of no other customer reports of the alleged\nissues with the AMD chip that Quanta used, which AMD no longer\nsells,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cIn fact, Quanta has itself\nacknowledged to AMD that it used the identical chip in large\nvolumes in a different computer platform that it manufactured\nfor NEC without such issues.\u201d  The case is Quanta v. Advanced Micro Devices, 12-cv-12,\nU.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).  For the latest new suits news, click here. For copies of recent\ncivil complaints, click here.  Lawsuits/Pretrial  Halliburton Denies Destroying Evidence in BP Oil Spill Case  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  denied BP Plc\u2019s accusation that engineers\ndestroyed testing evidence to keep it from being used in\nlitigation over the Gulf of Mexico rig blast that triggered the\nworst offshore oil spill in U.S. history.  BP and Halliburton are suing each other over whose actions\ncaused the Macondo well to explode off the Louisiana coast in\nApril 2010. BP asked U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of New\nOrleans to sanction Halliburton last month, alleging the\ncementing services firm hid or destroyed unfavorable testing\nevidence.  Halliburton said in a filing yesterday that engineers\nfollowed company policy to discard the testing results and\nmaterials because the tests were \u201cperformed on lab stock that\nremains available today.\u201d Halliburton also said tests on cement\nsamples like those used in the well showed the formula was\nstable.  Halliburton\u2019s engineers turned over notes and testified\nunder oath that tests showed \u201ca stable foam was observed after\nthe slurry was conditioned -- a critical fact that BP continues\nto ignore,\u201d Donald Godwin, Halliburton\u2019s lead trial lawyer,\nsaid in a filing in federal court in New Orleans.  \u201cWe stand by our motions and the arguments we made in\nprior papers,\u201d  Daren Beaudo , a spokesman for BP, said in an e-\nmail in response to Halliburton\u2019s filing.  BP and Halliburton have been fighting about the cement job\nHalliburton provided to seal the well against leaks, based on\nBP\u2019s design specifications. Halliburton used an innovative\nfoaming cement formulation that critics claim wasn\u2019t right for\nthe Macondo formation. As a result, BP claims the contractor\u2019s\nwork was flawed, while Halliburton maintains BP provided faulty\ninformation.  The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater\nHorizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).

MF Global Plaintiffs Compete to Lead Lawsuit Against Corzine  Plaintiffs including funds and retirement systems are\ncompeting to lead a lawsuit against Jon Corzine,  MF Global\nHoldings Ltd. (MFGLQ) \u2019s former chief executive officer, over the\ncollapse of the commodity brokerage.  Corzine is the defendant in at least nine lawsuits before a\nfederal judge in Manhattan that seek compensation for losses\nfrom the company\u2019s bankruptcy, according to court papers.  U.S. District Judge  Victor Marrero  has been combining the\ncases into one, saying they make similar claims that Corzine and\nother company officials made misleading statements about MF\nGlobal\u2019s financial condition before its Oct. 31 Chapter 11\nfiling.  Banyon Capital Master Fund Ltd., Virginia and Arkansas\nretirement systems and the Building Trades United Pension Trust\nFund all filed separate requests in court yesterday to serve as\nlead plaintiff. Yesterday was the deadline for such requests,\naccording to court papers.  Andrew Levander, a lawyer for Corzine, didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to an e-mail seeking comment on the filings.  The Virginia Retirement System, which wants to lead the\nsuit together with Canada\u2019s Province of Alberta, said in a\nfiling the two together lost more than $19 million on MF Global\nstock and debt.  They asked court approval of their hiring law firms\n Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman LLP (142230L) , whose cases include a\nshareholder suit against  BP Plc (BP/)  directors and managers, and\n Labaton Sucharow LLP , as co-lead counsel for investors suing\nCorzine.  Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, and senior MF\nGlobal officers touted the company\u2019s internal financial controls\nand liquidity levels in statements that were \u201cmaterially\nmisleading or untrue,\u201d according to a Nov. 3 complaint filed in\nManhattan federal court by Joseph DeAngelis on behalf of himself\nand other MF Global shareholders.  DeAngelis also named Henri Steenkamp, the New York-based\ncompany\u2019s chief financial officer, and  Bradley Abelow , its\npresident.  MF Global filed for bankruptcy listing $41 billion in\nassets after making bets on European sovereign debt and getting\nmargin calls. The holding company is the parent of a futures\nbrokerage that is being liquidated in a separate court\nproceeding.  The main case is DeAngelis v. Corzine, 11-cv-7866, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  For more, click here.  Rajat Gupta Seeks to Have Some Insider-Trading Counts Thrown Out  Rajat Gupta, the former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  director\ncharged with insider trading as part of the Galleon Group LLC\nprobe, asked a judge to dismiss some of the counts against him.  The government\u2019s indictment focuses on two instances in\nwhich the U.S. said Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam traded on\ninformation he allegedly received from Gupta, though it\n\u201cimproperly uses those two instances to create five purportedly\nseparate substantive securities-fraud charges,\u201d according to\nGupta\u2019s filing in federal court in Manhattan.  \u201cThe five substantive securities fraud counts in the\nindictment, because they stem from just two purported unlawful\nacts, repeatedly charge what are, at most, two alleged\noffenses,\u201d according to the filing Jan. 3. Gupta asked the\njudge to consolidate the charges or order prosecutors to choose\nwhich to pursue.  In a separate filing Jan. 3, Gupta asked that prosecutors\nbe barred from using wiretap evidence. The government intends to\npresent a \u201ccircumstantial case\u201d based on the timing of alleged\ntelephone calls between Gupta and Rajaratnam and recordings the\nU.S. obtained by wiretapping Rajaratnam\u2019s cell phone, according\nto the filing.  Gupta\u2019s lawyers said the court\u2019s rejection of a similar bid\nby Rajaratnam to bar the intercepts as evidence during his trial\nwas incorrect. Federal laws restricting use of wiretaps don\u2019t\npermit them in investigations of suspected insider trading,\naccording to Gupta\u2019s filing.  Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter & Gamble Co.\nand led McKinsey & Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury in\nOctober on five counts of securities fraud and one count of\nconspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside\ninformation to Rajaratnam. Gupta also faces a lawsuit filed by\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara\nin Manhattan, didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment\non the filings after regular business hours yesterday.  Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of directing the\nbiggest insider-trading ring in a generation. His 11-year prison\nterm was the longest sentence ever handed down for such a crime\nand the culmination of a four-year nationwide probe of insider\ntrading.  The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, U.S. District\nCourt, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  CFTC Asks Court to Dismiss Challenge to Position Limits Rule  The U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission  asked a\nfederal appeals court to dismiss a challenge by two Wall Street\ngroups to its rule that limits commodity speculation, one of the\nfinancial industry\u2019s highest-profile efforts to weaken last\nyear\u2019s Dodd-Frank law.  The CFTC filed its request yesterday in the U.S. Court of\nAppeals in Washington, arguing the appeals court doesn\u2019t have\njurisdiction to consider the lawsuit. The agency said that the\ndistrict court must first consider a challenge to the rule.  The  International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. \nand  Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  filed\nlawsuits in two federal courts in Washington last month, arguing\nthat the CFTC used a flawed analysis of Dodd-Frank when it\ndecided to impose the restrictions. The associations also said\nthe CFTC failed to properly weigh the rule\u2019s costs and benefits.  In response to questions from the district court judge, the\ngroups said last month they didn\u2019t oppose putting the district\ncourt case on hold while the appeals court considers the\nchallenge.  The case is International Swaps and Derivatives Association\nv. CFTC, 11-01491, is U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of\nColumbia (Washington).  For the latest lawsuits news, click here.  Trials/Appeals  Stanford\u2019s Defense Experts Paid, Ordered to Remain on Case  R. Allen Stanford\u2019s defense experts were ordered to\ncontinue defending the former financier in a $7 billion\ninvestment fraud case by a U.S. appellate court that also agreed\nto pay their back wages, according to court filings.  All of Stanford\u2019s non-attorney experts quit last week after\nappellate judges controlling the former billionaire\u2019s taxpayer-\nfunded defense budget said they would limit and withhold the\nexperts\u2019 compensation until after conclusion of his trial, set\nto begin Jan. 23 in Houston federal court.  \u201cIt would be neither feasible nor economical to obtain a\nreplacement to perform the services Marcum was expected by\ncounsel to provide,\u201d Circuit Judge Edith Jones, the chief of\nthe U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans, said in a letter\nyesterday to Marcum LLP, one of the expert contractors that\nresigned last week from Stanford\u2019s defense team.  Jones issued similar orders and agreements to pay overdue\ninvoices to two other expert-services contractors to keep them\nworking on Stanford\u2019s defense. Accumyn Consulting and the Worley\nGroup had also resigned last week over non-payment of bills\ndating back to September, according to court filings.  Ali Fazel, Stanford\u2019s lead criminal-defense attorney, said\nthe defense was hampered by the resignation of all expert-\nservices contractors on Dec. 30, after the appellate court\nbalked at paying their bills. Jones, in her letters yesterday,\nsaid billings by Marcum and Accumyn feature \u201chourly rates\nsignificantly in excess of the rates payable under the Criminal\nJustice Act to even the most experienced attorneys.\u201d  Stanford, 61, has been in custody as a flight risk since he\nwas indicted in June 2009 on charges of defrauding investors\nthrough allegedly bogus certificates of deposit at his Antigua-\nbased Stanford International Bank. He denies any wrongdoing.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09cr342, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC\ncase is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford\nInternational Bank, 09cv298, U.S. District Court, Northern\nDistrict of Texas (Dallas).  For more, click here.  Ex-UBS Wealth CEO Failed to Act on Risk Failures, FSA Says  John Pottage, the former chief executive officer of  UBS\nAG (UBSN) \u2019s wealth-management unit in the U.K., didn\u2019t heed warning\nsigns that risk controls in the division were ineffective before\nan unauthorized trading loss was discovered, the U.K.\u2019s finance\nregulator said.  Pottage, now a senior executive at the bank\u2019s headquarters\nin Zurich, should have started a review of controls after a\nclient-money breach, a payment fraud, and other failings were\ndiscovered, the Financial Services Authority said in court\npapers. He also should have done an \u201cadequate initial\nassessment\u201d of the unit\u2019s controls after becoming CEO, a lawyer\nfor the FSA said at a trial in  London  yesterday.  Pottage\u2019s actions constituted a regulatory breach, FSA\nlawyer Andrew Hochhauser said in the first day of closing\narguments in the case, where the ex-CEO is challenging a 100,000\npound ($156,000) fine. The case is the first time the regulator\nhas sought to penalize an executive for oversight failures.  Pottage said in court papers he worked to improve systems\nand controls in the unit when he started as CEO in September\n2006 and doesn\u2019t deserve a fine. Pottage, who moved to Zurich\namid the FSA probe, denies the charge that he should\u2019ve acted\nsooner than he did to review weaknesses in the systems and\ncontrols, and \u201cis supported in that denial by UBS,\u201d his\nlawyers have said.  Pottage testified during the three-week hearing that he was\n\u201cconfused\u201d by the regulator\u2019s attempt to fine him and that he\nthought it didn\u2019t understand his role at the bank. He said\nduring a meeting with the regulator in 2009 that he was\n\u201cconcerned that the interviewer thought the CEO was a fully\nempowered individual.\u201d  For more, click here.

(CVX) \u2019s effort to overturn an $18 billion judgment\nagainst it was rejected by an Ecuador appeals court in a lawsuit\nalleging the company is responsible for chemicals spilled in the\nAmazon River basin more than 20 years ago.  The \u201cadverse ruling\u201d upholding the lower-court judgment\nwas issued by a panel of three judges in the Provincial Court of\nJustice of Sucumbios in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, Chevron said in an\ne-mailed statement Jan. 3.  Chevron appealed a February ruling that it was responsible\nfor chemical-laden wastewater dumped in jungle land from 1964 to\nabout 1992 by Texaco Inc., which Chevron acquired in 2001.  The \u201cdecision is another glaring example of the\npoliticization and corruption of Ecuador\u2019s judiciary that has\nplagued this fraudulent case from the start,\u201d Chevron said in\nits statement. The company \u201cdoes not believe that the Ecuador\nruling is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of\nlaw.\u201d  The appeals court ratified the February ruling \u201cin all of\nits parts, including the conviction for moral reparation or its\nalternative and costs,\u201d according to the decision.  Chevron is still reviewing the ruling and hasn\u2019t decided\nwhat it will do next, Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the San\nRamon, California-based company, said Jan. 3 in a phone\ninterview. He said the company \u201chas a procedural right to seek\nclarification and amplification from the court that issued this\nruling.\u201d  Chevron can also appeal the decision to the next level of\nEcuador\u2019s judiciary, Robertson said.  Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for lawyers representing the\nEcuador residents who sued Chevron, said in an e-mailed\nstatement, \u201cThe decision by an independent appellate court is\nyet further confirmation of Chevron\u2019s extraordinary greed and\ncriminal misconduct in Ecuador.\u201d  For more, click here.  Pfizer Must Pay $45 Million in Prempro Cases, Court Rules  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  must pay more than $45 million in damages to\ntwo women who blamed the company\u2019s menopause drugs for their\nbreast cancers, an appeals court ruled.  Connie Barton and Donna Kendall, two Illinois women who\nsued Pfizer units Wyeth and Pharmacia & Upjohn over their\nmenopause medications, deserved both compensatory and punitive\ndamages over the companies\u2019 handling of the drugs, a panel of\nthe Pennsylvania Superior Court ruled Jan. 3.  \u201cWe are very disappointed with the court\u2019s decisions in\nthese cases and continue to believe there was no basis in fact\nor law for the jury verdicts,\u201d Chris Loder, a spokesman for New\nYork-based Pfizer, said in an e-mailed statement. Pfizer\nofficials will ask the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to review the\nlower court\u2019s findings, he said.  More than 6 million women took Prempro and related\nmenopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood\nswings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer. At\none point, Pfizer and its units faced more than 10,000 lawsuits\nover the medications.  \u201cThis is a great way to start 2012 for these two brave\nwomen,\u201d  Zoe Littlepage , one of Barton\u2019s lawyers, said in a\ntelephone interview yesterday. Under the appellate ruling,\nBarton would get a total of $11.2 million while Kendall would\nget $34.3 million, Littlepage said.  At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than\n10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,\naccording to lawyers for former users. Those lawsuits included\nmore than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas\nand suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Minnesota.  The company has begun settling some suits and has set aside\n$840 million so far to resolve cases, officials said in\nNovember. Pfizer has resolved about 46 percent of the pending\nPrempro suits, officials said.  The case is Barton v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc.,\n040406301, Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County,\nPennsylvania (Philadelphia).  For more, click here.  Ex-LyondellBasell Employee Gets 7-Year Sentence in Kickbacks  Ex- LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB)  employee Jonathan Paul\nBarnes was sentenced to seven years in prison on fraud and\nmoney-laundering charges in a kickback scheme involving oil\nshipments to the company\u2019s Texas refinery.  Barnes, 56, was sentenced yesterday in Houston federal\ncourt by U.S. District Judge Sim Lake, who also ordered Barnes\nto pay $82 million in restitution, federal prosecutors said in a\nstatement.  Barnes pleaded guilty in March to accepting about $20\nmillion in kickbacks while managing marine chartering for\nLyondell\u2019s Houston refinery from 2007 to early 2010.  He acknowledged running a scheme that overcharged\nLyondell\u2019s Houston subsidiary roughly $82 million on oil\nshipments from Venezuela, according to court papers. He was\nassisted by two oil traders, Bernard Langley, 54, of the U.K.,\nand Clyde Meltzer, 65, of Houston and Livingston, N.J. Both have\npleaded guilty to funneling kickbacks to Barnes and are awaiting\nsentencing in April.  \u201cThe United States has already seized assets purchased\nwith proceeds from the kickback fraud that are valued at\napproximately $20 million,\u201d Kenneth Magidson, the U.S. Attorney\nfor Houston, said in the statement.  The seized assets included real estate in Houston, Florida\nand upstate New York and \u201cmore than 15 luxury and classic\nvehicles including a 1957 Cadillac once owned by Frank Sinatra,\na boat and numerous pieces of high-end jewelry,\u201d Magidson said.  \u201cThe kickback scheme was uncovered during an internal\naudit, which raised questions about certain marine chartering\ncosts which appeared to deviate from the industry norm,\u201d David\nHarpole, Lyondell\u2019s Houston spokesman, said in an e-mail in\nresponse to yesterday\u2019s sentencing.  He said that when an\ninternal investigation disclosed apparent kickbacks, the company\n\u201ctook immediate steps to address the matter,\u201d including firing\nBarnes and referring the matter for criminal investigation by\nthe Justice Department\u2019s Houston division.  Rusty Hardin , Barnes\u2019s lawyer, didn\u2019t respond to a call\nseeking comment on yesterday\u2019s sentence.  The case is U.S. v.

DJSP Enterprises Inc. (DJSP) , which took on the non-legal\nforeclosure-processing services of Stern\u2019s law firm and depended\non his referrals, said in a copy of a complaint included in a\nregulatory filing dated Jan. 3 that Stern concealed his business\nwas \u201csystematically engaging in unlawful and fraudulent\nconduct\u201d in foreclosures.  Those practices jeopardized Stern\u2019s relationships with his\nbiggest clients, including banks and government mortgage\ncompanies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the viability of his\nlaw firm and DJSP, according to the complaint.  DJSP said the complaint was filed Jan. 3 in Broward County,\nFlorida. The filing of the suit couldn\u2019t be immediately\nconfirmed with the court.

(LEHMQ)  brokerage\nis seeking $24.3 million in fees for himself and his law firm\nfor the four months through June, plus expenses of about\n$299,916.  James Giddens, who also is liquidating the  MF Global Inc. (MF) \nbroker-dealer, asked a judge to approve the fees for Lehman work\nJan.3in his eighth request in the three years since the Lehman\nparent filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Prior fees\nand expenses approved for the trustee and his firm,  Hughes\nHubbard & Reed LLP (1218L) , total $145.6 million, according to a filing\nyesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.

Giddens plans to start paying the Lehman brokerage\u2019s\nremaining customers, mostly hedge funds and institutions, early\nnext year from available assets of $18.3 billion, he said last\nmonth. He didn\u2019t say how much money customers can expect, only\nthat his goal was to make \u201ca significant\u201d payment.
