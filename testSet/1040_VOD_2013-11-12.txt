 "context": "The following article called 'Vodafone Adds to Network Spending as Sales Miss Estimates' was published on 2013-11-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVodafone Group Plc (VOD) , the second-largest wireless company, will plow billions into improving its\nnetwork speed and coverage as it works to reverse service-sales\ndeclines that trailed analysts\u2019 estimates.  Investments in \u201cProject Spring,\u201d the network-improvement\nproject announced in September, will expand to 7 billion pounds\n($11.2 billion) by March 2016 -- a year ahead of schedule and 1\nbillion pounds extra -- Vodafone said today. Service revenue,\nexcluding currency swings and acquisitions, fell 4.9 percent in\nthe quarter ended Sept 30, missing analysts\u2019 estimates for a 4.6\npercent decline, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Vittorio Colao  is betting that\nVodafone can benefit from investing ahead of a recovery in\nEuropean markets, expanding the reach of faster mobile and fiber\nbroadband services. Including Project Spring, Vodafone will\nspend more than 19 billion pounds on its network by 2016, Colao\nsaid on a conference call today. It may be difficult for\ncompetitors to keep pace with the Newbury, England-based\ncompany\u2019s spending, according to a report from Moody\u2019s Investors\nService.  \u201cThe clear, underlying message is that most companies in\nEurope are going to have to step up their capex in order to\naccelerate convergence to set off the challenges coming from\nVodafone,\u201d said Carlos Winzer, senior vice president of\ncorporate finance at Moody\u2019s.  Network Investments  Project Spring\u2019s goal is to improve Vodafone\u2019s high-speed\nwireless and fixed networks in Europe as well as select high-growth markets like parts of Africa and  India . Vodafone is\nfunding the plan with the $130 billion in proceeds it got from\nselling its stake in U.S. mobile company Verizon Wireless.  Vodafone rose 1.6 percent to 231.05 pence at 10:11 a.m. in\nLondon trading. The shares had gained 47 percent this year\nthrough yesterday.  First-half sales, before changes to how joint-venture\nrevenue is recorded, fell 3.2 percent to 22.03 billion pounds.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n6.6 billion pounds, the company said in a statement today.\nAnalysts had predicted sales of 21.8 billion pounds and Ebitda\nof 6.42 billion pounds, according to the average of seven\nestimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Recovering Economies  Colao said he sees an improvement in Europe\u2019s economic\nenvironment on the horizon. Vodafone reported first-half\norganic-revenue declines -- which include the effect of\nregulatory restrictions on what it can charge other carriers for\nusing its network -- of 15 percent in southern Europe and 3.9\npercent in northern and central Europe in the quarter. Vodafone\nsaid northern Europe\u2019s economy will return to growth in 2013 and\nsouthern Europe will do the same in 2014.  \u201cWe expect that during the next three to five years,\nEurope will definitely improve,\u201d Colao said. \u201cTherefore, we\nprefer to have a stronger, more performing and more\ndifferentiated operation by then so that we can come out at a\nhigher speed than everybody else.\u201d  Vodafone targeted adjusted operating profit of around 5\nbillion pounds and free cash flow between 4.5 billion pounds and\n5 billion pounds for the year ending in March 2014.  Vodafone\u2019s competitors are seeing mixed results. Telefonica\nSA, Spain\u2019s largest phone company, said this month that while\nrevenue fell 12 percent in its home country, margins had begun\nto improve. Spain exited a two-year recession last quarter,\nwhich helped Telefonica hold on to more customers.  Tanzania, Italy  Orange SA,  France \u2019s largest phone company, said profit fell\n7.7 percent in the quarter amid competition on tariffs while\nGermany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom AG reported a 2.6 percent drop in\nadjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization because of price wars in eastern Europe.  Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , the South African carrier controlled by\nVodafone, will ramp up investment in its 3G networks in Tanzania\nusing Project Spring funds, Chief Executive Officer Shameel Joosub said yesterday.  Vodafone will double its investments in Italy to 3.6\nbillion euros ($4.8 billion) over two years, the local unit said\ntoday. The business will use the funds, which are on top of the\n900 million euros annually invested, to develop mobile and bring\nhigh-speed fixed broadband services to 25 percent of the Italian\npopulation by 2016.  Vodafone will increase the 2014 dividend by 8 percent with\ncompletion of the Verizon Wireless stake sale, bringing it to 11\npence per share.  That sale, expected to be completed in the first three\nmonths of 2014, gives Vodafone the flexibility to reassess its\nholdings across the globe. Vodafone bought Kabel Deutschland\nHolding AG this year for about 7.5 billion euros, expanding\nVodafone\u2019s services in  Germany  to include TV and Internet.  Indian Expansion  Vodafone last month asked the Indian government for\npermission to raise its stake in its local unit to 100 percent.\nIndia is Vodafone\u2019s largest market by customers, and accounts\nfor about 9.8 percent of annual revenue, though customer bills\non the continent are lower than in Europe. The company said\ntoday that it expects the deal to go through and doesn\u2019t have a\nclear time frame for approval from the government.  \u201cThe regulatory framework is becoming increasingly clear,\nparticularly in India, underpinning our expectations for\ncontinued strong growth and improving profitability,\u201d Vodafone\nsaid in the statement.  The company has also considered an acquisition of  Italy \u2019s\nFastweb SpA, the fixed-line company that Swisscom AG took over\nin 2007, people familiar with the matter said in June.  AT&T Interest  Since disposing of the Verizon Wireless stake, Vodafone has\nbeen eyed by Dallas-based AT&T Inc., according to people\nfamiliar with the situation. AT&T executives are laying the\ngroundwork internally for a potential takeover next year, which\nmay involve splitting Vodafone\u2019s European operations from the\nAfrican and Indian businesses, the people said, asking not to be\nnamed discussing private deliberations.  AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has met with European Union\nofficials this year to discuss plans for a lighter regulatory\nregime that would reignite growth for the continent\u2019s phone\ncompanies. More predictable spectrum allocations, coordination\nacross borders and flexibility in wireless technologies will\nencourage carriers to invest more in networks and services,\nStephenson said at a conference in Brussels last month.  Colao declined to comment today on talks with AT&T.
