Krall has become a familiar sight in courtrooms around the\nworld as Apple\u2019s chief litigation counsel. Her greatest victory\ncame Aug. 24, when a California jury ordered Samsung Electronics\nCo., the biggest smartphone maker, to pay Apple more than $1\nbillion for infringing patents related to the iPhone.  \u201cThere is no historical precedent for what Noreen Krall is\ndoing,\u201d said John Thorne, who ran Verizon Communications Inc.\u2019s\nintellectual-property team before joining Kellogg Huber in\nWashington this year. \u201cGood generalship produces results like\nNoreen has gotten. She\u2019s mastering big decisions, like which law\nfirms to hire, how to manage resources, how much of  Tim Cook \u2019s\ntime to take.\u201d  Krall, 47, and her boss, General Counsel Bruce Sewell, have\namassed a team of lawyers from inside Apple and some of the top\nU.S. law firms to fight Samsung,  HTC Corp. (2498)  and Google\u2019s Motorola\nMobility unit over Google\u2019s Android mobile operating system and\nthe smartphones and tablets that run on it.  The fight is central to Apple\u2019s identity under Cook, who\nsucceeded Jobs as chief executive, as it got 46.4 percent of its\nsales from the iPhone last quarter and 26 percent from the iPad.\nThe iPhone generated $47 billion in sales last fiscal year and\nthe iPad $20.1 billion.  Apple and Samsung together make more than half of the\nsmartphones sold in the world. Samsung is the biggest player in\nthe global market and Apple dominant in the U.S. The companies\nare vying for increased share of a market that Bloomberg\nIndustries said grew 62 percent to $219 billion last year.  Krall\u2019s job includes understanding the patent rules and\ncourt procedures in more than three dozen jurisdictions, making\nsure arguments are consistent, providing feedback and keeping\nher team motivated. She observes her lawyers\u2019 arguments from\nbenches or public seating in the back of courtrooms, leaving\nwith them at the end of the day.  For more, click here.

Litigation  HSBC Sues Troutman Sanders Over $100 Million Nemazee Loan  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe\u2019s biggest bank, sued law firm\nTroutman Sanders LLP for malpractice in connection with a $100\nmillion loan to convicted fraudster Hassan Nemazee.  Nemazee, a former fundraiser for President  Barack Obama  and\nSecretary of State  Hillary Clinton , was sentenced in 2010 to 12\nyears in federal prison after pleading guilty to cheating\nCitigroup Inc., HSBC and  Bank of America Corp.  of $292 million.  HSBC hired Troutman Sanders and Robert Chanis, a former\nattorney for the firm who is now with  Harris Beach , to negotiate\nthe terms of the loan to Nemazee, according to a Sept. 7 filing\nby HSBC in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  \u201cAs a direct result of defendants\u2019 negligent acts and/or\nomissions, either singly or in combination, Nemazee was able to\nsteal $75 million from HSBC after purportedly pledging\nsecurities which never existed as collateral for the loan,\u201d\nHSBC said in the complaint.  HSBC is improperly trying to cast blame on Troutman Sanders\nand Chanis and is misrepresenting what happened with the loan,\nsaid Edward Friedman, an attorney with Friedman Kaplan Seiler &\nAdelman LLP in New York who said he is representing both\ndefendants.  \u201cTroutman Sanders and Mr. Chanis acted appropriately and\nwere not negligent,\u201d Friedman said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cThe responsibility for this lending decision rested solely\nwith HSBC and any losses incurred by HSBC were caused by the\nfraud of  Hassan Nemazee  and/or the bank\u2019s failure to protect its\nown interests.\u201d  The case is HSBC Bank USA N.A. v. Troutman Sanders LLP,\n653138/2012, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  News  Adelson\u2019s Sands Faces Sanctions for Not Disclosing Macau Files  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  may be sanctioned in a lawsuit\nbrought by the fired chief executive of its China casinos for\nnot disclosing that evidence it said couldn\u2019t be taken out of\n Macau  was already in the U.S.  The casino operator, run and majority-owned by  Sheldon Adelson , was ordered to explain to a  Nevada  judge in Las Vegas\nyesterday how and why files from its Macau operations, requested\nby Steven Jacobs as evidence in his breach-of-contract case,\nended up in the U.S. while the company claimed that Macau law\nprevented it from transferring them overseas.  \u201cWhether they were in the U.S. wrongfully, appropriately,\nor in violation of Macau law is a different issue,\u201d Clark\nCounty District Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez told the company\u2019s\nlawyers at a June 28 hearing. \u201cBut nobody told any of us, and\nthat\u2019s a problem, counsel.\u201d  Jacobs, the former CEO of  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , sued in 2010\nafter he was fired. Jacobs alleges he was dismissed because he\nwouldn\u2019t give in to Adelson\u2019s \u201cillegal demands.\u201d Jacobs said\nAdelson directed him to secretly investigate Macau government\nofficials and use \u201cimproper leverage\u201d against them.  More than half of Adelson\u2019s gambling-empire profits come\nfrom his four casinos in the Chinese territory of Macau. Sands\nChina, accounted for $2.95 billion of the company\u2019s total $5.34\nbillion in revenue during the first half of the year, according\nto its second-quarter earnings report.  Following Jacobs\u2019s allegations, the U.S. Justice Department\nand Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations\ninto whether Adelson\u2019s company violated the Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act. That law prohibits companies with U.S. operations\nand their intermediaries from making improper payments to\nforeign officials to win or retain business.  Las Vegas Sands has denied Jacobs\u2019s allegations and has\nsaid it is cooperating with the investigations. Lawyers for the\ncasino company have said in court filings that Jacobs was\ndismissed for working on unauthorized deals and violating\ncompany policy.  Ron Reese , a spokesman for Las Vegas Sands, declined to\ncomment on the case. Todd Bice, a lawyer for Jacobs, didn\u2019t\nreturn phone calls seeking comment.  Gonzalez said June 28 that while she won\u2019t jail anyone over\nthe disclosure dispute and probably won\u2019t penalize the Sands\nwith a ruling limiting its use of evidence, she may impose a\nfine.  Jacobs is seeking copies of his computer hard drives as\nwell as e-mails that were transferred to Las Vegas Sands from\nMacau in August 2010, about a month after he was fired,\naccording to a July 6 filing.  The case is  Steven Jacobs  v. Las Vegas Sands, A627691-B,\nDistrict Court, Clark County, Nevada.  For more, click here.
