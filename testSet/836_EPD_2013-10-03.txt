Karen\u2019s top sustained winds strengthened to 65 miles (105\nkilometers) per hour yesterday, up from 60 mph earlier. It was\nabout 400 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River and\nmoving north-northwest at 12 mph, the National Hurricane Center\nin Miami said in an advisory at 5 p.m. New York time yesterday.

Shear, when winds blow at varying speeds or\ndirections at different altitudes, could tear at the storm\u2019s\nstructure.
