 "context": "The following article called 'Apple\u2019s Siri Gets Below-Average Grade From Piper Jaffray' was published on 2012-06-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA new report about  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s\nvoice-recognition software Siri concludes what many users have\nbeen saying for a while: It doesn\u2019t work all that well.  Of 1,600 common searches, the speech technology accurately\nresolved the request 62 percent of the time on a loud street and\n68 percent in a quieter setting, according to a report released\ntoday by Piper Jaffray Cos., the Minneapolis-based investment\nbank. The report graded the technology \u201cD\u201d for accuracy, while\npredicting it will improve as more features are added.  \u201cYou\u2019re playing the lottery when you\u2019re using Siri,\u201d said\n Gene Munster , the Piper Jaffray  analyst  who conducted the study.\n\u201cThey have a plan to be more competitive, but it\u2019s going to\ntake a couple of years.\u201d  Apple has made Siri the defining characteristic of its\niPhone 4S, spending heavily on advertisements featuring actors\nsuch as Samuel L. Jackson and  Zooey Deschanel . The ads have\ncontrasted with the experience of many users, who have taken to\ncustomer forums and websites to complain that Siri doesn\u2019t work\nas well as it\u2019s being marketed. One group of customers even\nfiled a class-action suit against Apple for false advertising.\nApple has denied any wrongdoing.  Apple continues to build features for Siri. Earlier this\nmonth, the company said its new iOS 6 mobile operating system\nwill support sports statistics and movie listings. As more\napplications like that are added and the accuracy is improved,\nthe speech-recognition technology will displace searches that\nmany users now perform through  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s search engine.  Verbal Shopping  \u201cApple would love nothing more than to take that away from\nGoogle,\u201d Munster said. He expects commerce features to be added\neventually so people can shop by speaking out commands.  Munster said that while Siri is good at comprehending what\na user is saying and will accurately repeat the question, it\nstruggles turning those words into a correct answer. For\ninstance, Siri will repeat old answers when a user is trying to\nask a new question. The technology also struggles when trying to\nuse speech commands to find directions, Munster said.  In Piper Jaffray\u2019s tests, Siri was able to accurately\ndecipher what a user was saying 83 percent of the time on the\nstreet and 89 percent in an area with low noise.  \u201cApple right now gets a \u2018B\u2019 in comprehension and a \u2018D\u2019 in\naccuracy,\u201d Munster said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between\ncomprehension and her actually doing what you want her to do.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAdam Satariano in  San Francisco  at \n asatariano1@bloomberg.net ;  To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nTom Giles at \n tgiles5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 17.424415588378906 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
