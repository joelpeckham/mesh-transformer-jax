 "context": "The following article called 'RBA Easing Cycle Halted by Biggest Job Gain in 13 Years: Economy' was published on 2013-03-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia \u2019s  interest-rate reduction\ncycle  may have ended as traders bet the biggest gain in payrolls\nin almost 13 years will prompt the central bank to hold off\nfurther cuts, sending the currency to a one-month high.  Contracts based on overnight borrowing costs show a 66\npercent chance the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will leave rates at\n3 percent through September, compared with a 68 percent chance\nof at least a quarter-percentage-point cut that was priced in on\nMarch 8, swaps data compiled by Bloomberg show. The number of\npeople employed in February jumped 71,500, the biggest monthly\ngain since July 2000, according to an Australian Bureau of\nStatistics  report  in Sydney today.  \u201cWhile the  labor force  survey is very volatile, the trend\nis now clearly improving,\u201d said George Tharenou, a senior\neconomist in Sydney at UBS AG. \u201cOverall, the stronger labor\nmarket data is consistent with our non-consensus view that the\nRBA cash rate has troughed.\u201d  The data show the RBA\u2019s 1.75 percentage points of rate cuts\nin the past 17 months are rebalancing an economy where mining\nregions in the north and west have thrived, while builders and\nmanufacturers in the south and east struggled. It\u2019s also a boost\nto Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  who trails in polls. Australian\ngovernment bond yields surged, with all maturities above the\nRBA\u2019s cash rate of 3 percent for the first time since July 2011.  Today\u2019s report showed the  unemployment rate  held at 5.4\npercent, compared with economists\u2019 forecast for a rise in\njoblessness to 5.5 percent and a 10,000 increase in employment.\nAustralia\u2019s participation rate, a measure of the labor force in\nproportion to the population, gained to 65.3 percent in February\nfrom 65 percent a month earlier, it showed.  Market Reaction  The Australian dollar touched $1.0383 in Sydney, the\nhighest since Feb. 6, from $1.0306 before the data were\nreleased. The two-year government bond yield reached 3.11\npercent, from 2.96 percent before the data\u2019s release, while the\n10-year yield climbed to 3.71 percent, the highest since April,\nfrom 3.60 percent.  While February\u2019s jobs number was \u201cpositive,\u201d the central\nbank needs to also weigh other data on the employment market,\nsuch as lower average hours worked, RBA Assistant Governor\nChristopher Kent said in Sydney today.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want to turn things around on the basis of one\nmonth\u2019s number,\u201d Kent said in reply to questions. \u201cThe labor\nmarket\u2019s very important, but it\u2019s not the full story. So you\nwant to be looking at a range of other indicators.\u201d  The employment report showed the number of  full-time jobs \nadvanced by 17,800 in February, and part-time employment rose by\n53,700. New South Wales, the nation\u2019s most-populous state, added\n22,000 jobs, and Victoria, the No.2, gained 37,900, erasing a\n34,800 loss in January. The resource-rich states of Queensland\nand  Western Australia  lost a combined 3,700 jobs.  \u2018Hard to Attract\u2019  \u201cA raft of companies has been telling us that it is hard\nto attract and retain the right workers,\u201d said  Craig James , a\nsenior economist at a unit of  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) ,\nthe nation\u2019s biggest lender. \u201cIt is just that the headlines are\ndominated by a small number of listed companies announcing job\ncuts rather than the raft of small and medium-sized firms that\nare getting on with business and hiring new workers.\u201d  On Feb. 21,  Iluka Resources Ltd. (ILU) , the world\u2019s biggest\nzircon producer,  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) , Australia\u2019s biggest\nelectricity retailer, and Telstra Corp., its biggest phone\ncompany, announced a total 1,200 job cuts.  While the Australian currency has stayed above parity with\nthe  U.S. dollar  for more than eight months, its longest stretch\nover that threshold since it was freely floated in 1983, hurting\nindustries exposed to international goods, some are weathering\nthe competition.  Asia-Pacific Region  Cotton On Clothing Pty, a Geelong, Victoria-based retailer,\nwill expand its headquarters and create 500 jobs, the state\ngovernment announced late last year. U.S.-based yogurt company\nChobani opened a A$30 million plant in Victoria and expects to\ncreate 150 positions, the company said in December.  Elsewhere in  Asia , central banks in South Korea and the\n Philippines  left benchmark rates unchanged today.  New Zealand \u2019s\ncentral bank said it expects to keep  borrowing costs  at a record\nlow until next year and signaled a preparedness to reduce its\nbenchmark rate if the local dollar rises more than the economy\njustifies.  \u201cIf the  exchange rate  rose for reasons not justified by\nNew Zealand\u2019s economic fundamentals, all other things equal,\nthis would lead to a lower-than-expected OCR,\u201d the  Reserve Bank\nof New Zealand  said in a statement earlier today, helping send\nthe nation\u2019s currency to the lowest level this year.  Spanish Sales  In Europe, Spain\u2019s adjusted retail sales fell 10.2 percent\nin January from a year earlier. The  Swiss National Bank  left the\nthree-month Libor target rate at zero.  U.S. initial jobless claims probably rose to 350,000 in the\nweek ended March 9 from 340,000 in the previous period, a\nBloomberg survey showed before a report due today.  Australia\u2019s central bank said this month there are signs\nlower rates are gaining traction with households.  \u201cDuring 2012, there was a significant easing in monetary\npolicy,\u201d Governor  Glenn Stevens  said March 5 when he kept rates\nunchanged for a second-straight month. \u201cThere are signs that\nthe easier conditions are having some of the expected effects.\u201d  Treasurer  Wayne Swan  hailed the jobs result, saying\nAustralia\u2019s economic record \u201cstands in stark contrast\u201d to many\ndeveloped economies struggling to generate employment.  \u201cToday\u2019s figures once again confirm Australia has one of\nthe strongest set of economic fundamentals in the developed\nworld,\u201d Swan said in a statement after the report.
