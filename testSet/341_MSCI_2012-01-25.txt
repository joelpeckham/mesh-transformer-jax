 "context": "The following article called 'Dollar Near One-Month Low Versus Euro as Fed Extends Rate Pledge to 2014' was published on 2012-01-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe dollar traded near its weakest\nlevel in one month against the euro after the  Federal Reserve \nextended its pledge to keep  interest rates  low until late 2014.  The yen held a three-day loss against the 17-nation\ncurrency on prospects Asian stocks will extend gains in U.S.\nequities, reducing demand for haven assets. Strength in the euro\nwas limited after the  European Central Bank  was said to oppose\nrestructuring its Greek bonds. New Zealand\u2019s dollar halted a\nfour-day advance after Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard\nsignaled interest rates may stay at a record low\nfor longer than he intended a month ago.  \u201cThe Fed\u2019s pledge for a prolonged easing of monetary\npolicy boosted risk-on sentiment,\u201d said Kengo Suzuki, manager\nof the foreign-bond department in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities\nCo., a unit of  Japan \u2019s third-biggest listed bank by market\nvalue. \u201cDollar selling is likely to continue across the board,\nand the bias is for the yen to be weaker too.\u201d  The dollar traded at $1.3112 per euro as of 8:31 a.m. in\nTokyo from $1.3106 in  New York  yesterday, when it dropped to\n$1.3121, the lowest level since Dec. 21.  Japan\u2019s currency dropped to 101.98 yen per euro, the\nweakest since Dec. 26, before trading little changed at 101.93.\nThe yen was at 77.76 per dollar from 77.78 yesterday, when it\nreached 78.28, the weakest since Nov. 29.  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index advanced 0.9 percent\nyesterday, while the MSCI World Index of stocks rose 0.5\npercent.  Fed Pledge  \u201cThe Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative\nstance for monetary policy,\u201d the  Federal Open Market Committee \nsaid in a statement released in  Washington  yesterday. \u201cEconomic\nconditions -- including low rates of resource utilization and a\nsubdued outlook for inflation over the medium run -- are likely\nto warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate\nat least through late 2014.\u201d  The Fed had previously pledged to keep its  rate  target in\nplace until mid-2013.  New Zealand\u2019s dollar traded little changed at 81.69 U.S.\ncents and 63.48 yen. Australia\u2019s dollar fetched $1.0601 from\n$1.0597. It traded at 82.39 yen from 82.43 yen.  \u201cGiven ongoing uncertainty around global conditions and\nthe moderate pace of domestic demand, it remains prudent to keep\nthe official cash rate on hold at 2.5 percent,\u201d Bollard said in\na statement today in Wellington. That was a change from his\nDecember statement, when he said it was \u201cprudent for now\u201d to\nmaintain the rate, which has been at that level since March.
