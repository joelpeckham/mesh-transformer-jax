 "context": "The following article called 'Canadian Dollar Climbs Against U.S. Counterpart on Risk Appetite' was published on 2012-03-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanada\u2019s dollar advanced against\nits U.S. counterpart for a second day after comments from the\nleaders of Germany and the  Federal Reserve  stoked demand for\nhigher-yielding assets, such as stocks and commodities.  The currency rose against a majority of its most-traded\npeers on speculation the nation\u2019s exports may benefit from\ngrowth in the U.S., as economists predicted a report this week\nwill show orders for American durable goods rose in February. It\nappreciated the most against the  U.S. dollar  in more than two\nweeks as crude oil, Canada\u2019s largest export, topped $107 barrel\nin New York.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke \u201cwas back to his old ways\nwith a dovish tone that has given the market a risk lift, and we\nfound the Canadian dollar had a good day,\u201d said  Steve Butler ,\ndirector of foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at  Bank of Nova\nScotia (BNS) \u2019s Scotia Capital unit. \u201cHis comments definitely gave the\nmarket that extra push into strong risk mode.\u201d  Canada\u2019s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of\nthe waterfowl on the C$1 coin, rose 0.7 percent to 99.06 cents\nper U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, its biggest gain since\nMarch 8. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0095.  Government bonds fell, with the yield on the benchmark two-\nyear security rising one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,\nto 1.25 percent. The spread between Canadian and U.S. two-year\ndebt widened to about 91 basis points, with the American\nbenchmark yielding 0.34 percent.  The loonie rose after  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said  Germany \nmay back plans for the temporary and permanent euro-area rescue\nfunds to run at the same time.  Run in Parallel  \u201cWe could imagine that the program that has already been\nagreed with 200 billion\u201d euros ($266 billion) could run in\nparallel with the permanent European Stability Mechanism, which\ncomes into force in July, Merkel told reporters in Berlin today.  Canada\u2019s currency extended gains after Bernanke said\naccommodative monetary policy is still needed to reduce U.S.\nunemployment, increasing speculation of further monetary\nstimulus.  \u201cLast time we heard Bernanke, he seemed more neutral,\u201d\nButler said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who think\nquantitative easing is a possibility and his comments will have\nthe doves chirping about that.\u201d  The loonie\u2019s 1.6 percent gain is the second-best\nperformance over the past month among 10 major currencies\ntracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The\npound and the greenback, with gains of 1.7 percent and 0.7\npercent are the index\u2019s first- and third-best.  \u2018Rate-Hike Expectations\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019re sure to see some interest develop in the Canadian\ndollar throughout the week,\u201d  Jack Spitz , managing director of\nforeign exchange at  National Bank of Canada (NA)  in Toronto, wrote in\na note to clients today, citing tomorrow\u2019s Ontario budget and\nthe March 29 federal budget. \u201cA more constrictive budget than\nexpected could see rate-hike expectations get pushed out\nfurther.\u201d  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index rose 1.4 percent. Crude oil\nfor May delivery added 0.2 percent at $107.11 a barrel on the\n New York Mercantile Exchange  after dropping as low as $106.19\nbefore the Bernanke speech. Prices are up 8.4 percent this year.  The correlation between the loonie and crude futures has\nbeen increasing, with the correlation coefficient at 0.47 today,\nup from 0.30 last month. A correlation coefficient of 1 means\nthe measures move in lockstep. The currency\u2019s correlation with\nthe S&P 500 was 0.77 today, compared with 0.61 for copper and\n0.46 for the U.S.-Canada two-year yield spread, 30-day\ncorrelation data show.  \u201cThe Canadian dollar is one of the oil currencies, very\ntightly tied to developments in  oil prices ,\u201d said  Henrik Gullberg , a currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, by phone\nfrom London. \u201cThe fact the oil is still elevated and the  U.S.\neconomy  is leading the rest of the world, I think that should\nbenefit Canada because of the close trading links with the\nU.S.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAusten Sherman in  New York  at \n asherman18@bloomberg.net ;\nChris Fournier in Montreal at \n cfournier3@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDave Liedtka at \n dliedtka@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank Nova Scotia Halifax Pfd 3 was 35.88338851928711 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank Nova Scotia Halifax Pfd 3 was ",
