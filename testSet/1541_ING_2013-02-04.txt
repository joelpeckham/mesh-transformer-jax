 "context": "The following article called 'ING to Pay $5.8 Million in 401(k) Trade Disclosure Accord' was published on 2013-02-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAn  ING Groep NV (INGA)  unit that administers\n401(k) retirement plans agreed to pay $5.8 million to settle\nallegations it didn\u2019t tell clients that it would pocket market\ngains on trades that were delayed.  ING Life Insurance & Annuity Co., a Windsor, Connecticut-\nbased unit of the largest Dutch financial-services company, will\npay $5.25 million to about 1,400 retirement savings plans and a\npenalty of $524,509 to the U.S. government, according to a\nsettlement disclosed today by the Department of Labor.  \u201cAll of us who are planning for retirement deserve to know\nhow our savings and investments are being handled, how much is\nbeing charged in fees, and how much these transactions impact\nfinal account balances,\u201d Acting Secretary Seth D. Harris of the\nLabor Department said in a statement.  The accord represents the amount ING will pay plans for net\ngains it retained when there were errors or delays in processing\na trade or redemption from a 401(k) account. If the transaction\nresulted in a loss from the time of the request, ING restored\nfunds to the account, the Labor Department said.  \u201cOur longstanding policy has been to put customers in the\nposition they would have been in had a processing error never\noccurred,\u201d Joe Loparco, a spokesman for Amsterdam-based ING,\nsaid in an e-mail. \u201cWe are very pleased to have resolved this\nmatter with the Department of Labor in a way that benefits our\nclient plans and participants, and various stakeholders.\u201d  Cost Transparency  ING must now disclose in contracts with 401(k) clients its\npractice of keeping gains on transactions that are incorrect or\ndelayed, according to the settlement. Current plan clients will\nhave 30 days to object to the policy. The company also will\nreport at least once a year the amount of any gains it retained.\nThe Labor Department said it began investigating ING\u2019s practice\nin 2007 and the settlement involves transactions from 2008\nthrough 2011.  The agency has been focusing on cost transparency in\nemployer-sponsored  retirement plans  such as 401(k)s. It enacted\nrules last year requiring detailed disclosure of 401(k) expenses\nto workers and employers including those for  investment\nmanagement , custody and administration.  The department hasn\u2019t been able to adopt a proposed rule\nthat would have made more 401(k)-plan advisers abide by a so-\ncalled fiduciary standard, or put their clients\u2019 best interests\nfirst, after objections to its scope by some financial-services\ncompanies. The agency withdrew its original proposal in\nSeptember 2011, having considered comments on it, and has said\nit will re-propose the regulation this year.  Americans held about $3.5 trillion in 401(k) accounts as of\nSept. 30, according to the  Investment Company Institute , a\nWashington-based trade group representing mutual-fund firms.
