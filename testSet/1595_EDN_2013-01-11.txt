The rally started after the Argentine government announced\non Jan. 7 new rules for oil and gas producers paving the way for\nrate increases in the electricity distribution industry.  \u201cEdenor is the tip of the iceberg as its current market\nvalue is worth nothing,\u201d Carlos Aszpis, an equity strategist at\nSchweber & Cia., said in phone interview from Buenos Aires.\n\u201cThe rate increase will arrive next week, in six months or a\nyear, and the company will have to recover its 10 times higher\nvalue granted by investors in its initial public offering.\u201d  Argentine deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof was not\nimmediately available to take calls, his spokeswoman Jessica Rey\nsaid in a phone interview from Buenos Aires.
