 "context": "The following article called 'Ecuador Judge Says $19 Billion Chevron Ruling Was His Own' was published on 2013-11-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA former Ecuadorean judge who issued\na $19 billion pollution ruling against Chevron Corp. told a U.S.\ncourt that he worked alone on the case and denied the company\u2019s\nallegation that his decision was ghostwritten.  Nicolas Zambrano, the former judge, testified in a trial in\nfederal court in Manhattan today that the only help he received\nin preparing his 188-page ruling issued in 2011 came from an\n18-year-old secretary who typed his dictation and conducted\nInternet research for him.  Chevron claims in a racketeering case before U.S. District\nJudge  Lewis Kaplan  that the plaintiffs in the environmental case\nwon the ruling through bribery and fraud. The  San Ramon ,\nCalifornia-based energy company alleges that Zambrano and\nanother former Ecuadorean judge, Alberto Guerra, were bribed to\nsteer the case in favor of the plaintiffs and the $19 billion\njudgment was actually written by the plaintiffs and Guerra.  \u201cNo one has helped me to write the judgment,\u201d Zambrano\nsaid through a translator today when questioned by a lawyer for\nChevron, Randy Mastro. \u201cI was the one who explicitly drafted\nit.\u201d  The former judge, who also served as a prosecutor in\n Ecuador , said he spent \u201cmany hours, many days\u201d on the ruling.\nHe was unable to answer questions Mastro asked about specifics\nin the judgment, such as the identity of a substance that had\nbeen described in the document as \u201cthe most powerful\ncarcinogenic agent\u201d and information described as \u201cstatistical\ndata of the highest importance to delivering this ruling.\u201d  Internet Research  After Zambrano said he couldn\u2019t read or speak English or\nFrench, Mastro asked how he had managed to cite U.S., Australian\nand French legal authorities in the judgment.  \u201cAs I stated in my deposition, the young woman who would\nhelp me type the judgment, she was the one going on the\nInternet\u201d and she \u201cchose the Spanish option,\u201d Zambrano said.\n\u201cThat is how I would become aware or informed of the subject I\nwas interested in. She would print them so I could read them\nlater.\u201d  Guerra testified Oct. 23 that Zambrano routinely paid him\nto ghostwrite rulings in his cases, including the Chevron\nruling. Guerra also said that Zambrano had been promised\n$500,000 by the plaintiffs from the proceeds of the judgment and\nhad told Guerra he could also get a share.  Draft Orders  Zambrano testified that Guerra aided him in preparing\ndrafts of court orders, although not in the Chevron case.\nZambrano denied paying Guerra for his help. He previously has\ndenied accepting bribes to issue a ruling in favor of the\nplaintiffs.  Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based energy firm, claims\nthat lawyers for the plaintiffs, led by  Manhattan  attorney\nSteven Donziger, engaged in a scheme to extort money from the\ncompany during a 20-year legal battle over pollution in an\nEcuador oil concession.  The company is seeking an order barring lawyers for the\nEcuadoreans from trying to enforce the 2011 pollution judgment\nin countries where Chevron has assets.  Guerra now lives in the U.S. and receives $12,000 per month\nfrom Chevron along with other benefits through at least 2015\nunder an agreement with the company.  Drilling Wastes  In the environmental case, Donziger and other lawyers for\nindigenous people in Ecuador\u2019s Lago Agrio region sought damages\nfor Texaco Inc.\u2019s alleged dumping of toxic drilling wastes from\n1964 until about 1992. The lawsuit continued against Chevron\nwhen it acquired Texaco in 2001.  Chevron contends that state-owned Petroecuador, a former\nTexaco joint-venture partner, is responsible for most of the\npollution and that Texaco already paid to clean up its share.  Donziger claims he did nothing illegal in Ecuador and that\nhis tactics were no different from Chevron\u2019s.  The racketeering case is  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court,  Southern District of New York \n(Manhattan). The appeals court case is In Re Naranjo, 13-00772,\n U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).
