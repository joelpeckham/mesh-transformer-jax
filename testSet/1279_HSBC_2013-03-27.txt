The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAllianz SE (ALV) , Europe\u2019s biggest\ninsurer, bought Turkey\u2019s  Yapi Kredi Sigorta AS (YKSGR)  for 684 million\neuros ($879 million), seeking to expand in faster-growing\n emerging markets  as the debt crisis abated.  Allianz agreed to buy the company from Turkish bank  Yapi &\nKredi Bankasi AS (YKBNK) , it said in an e-mailed statement today.\nMunich-based Allianz said the deal will make it the country\u2019s\nlargest insurer and will provide access to Yapi & Kredi\u2019s 928\nbanking branches for its products over the next 15 years.  The world\u2019s insurance firms are competing for premiums in\ndeveloping economies as the expansion in traditional markets\nslows. Turkey is forecast by the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development to grow 4.1 percent this year as the\neuro area contracts 0.1 percent. Paris-based  Axa SA (CS)  agreed last\nyear to purchase  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) \u2019s general insurance\nbusinesses in  Mexico ,  Hong Kong  and  Singapore .  \u201cWe\u2019ve now seen Allianz and Axa dip their toes into small\nbolt-on deals in emerging markets in recent months, suggesting\nthat the larger conglomerates are becoming more comfortable that\nthe worst of the crisis is over,\u201d Shailesh Raikundlia, an\nanalyst at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in London, said in an\ne-mailed report to clients. \u201cAllianz\u2019s model is very\nunderweight emerging markets.\u201d  The agreement means Allianz will displace Axa as Turkey\u2019s\nbiggest insurance company in an industry where premiums grew 16\npercent to 17.1 billion liras ($9.4 billion) in 2012, according\nto figures published by the Insurance Association of Turkey.  \u2018Unique Opportunity\u2019  European insurers including Allianz are benefiting from a\nrecovery in financial markets and higher prices for some of\ntheir products. Net income at Allianz was 5.49 billion euros in\n2012, almost double the 2.8 billion euros it reported for 2011.  \u201cTurkey is one of the fastest growing insurance markets\nworldwide,\u201d Allianz board member Oliver Baete said. The\ntransaction \u201cis a unique opportunity to move into a market-\nleading position in one of  Europe \u2019s key growth markets,\u201d he\nsaid.  Allianz fell 3.1 percent to 105 euros at 1:21 p.m. in\n Frankfurt . The main  Stoxx 600 Insurance index  dropped 1.9\npercent.  Yapi Kredi Sigorta slumped 18 percent to 17.60 liras in\nIstanbul, the biggest decline in more than a decade. The deal\nhad valued the 93.9 percent stake that Allianz is buying at 23\npercent below yesterday\u2019s share price-based valuation of $1.14\nbillion. Allianz said it will conduct a mandatory offer for\nremaining stock after the transaction is complete.  Market Share  Allianz, which ranked third among insurers in Turkey last\nyear with a 7.3 percent market share, will increase its coverage\nto about 15 percent through the acquisition, according to data\nfrom the Insurance Association of Turkey. Axa controlled 12\npercent of the market and local firm  Anadolu Anonim Turk Sigorta\nSirketi (ANSGR)  11 percent, the data showed.  The agreement also means Allianz acquires 80 percent of\nlife insurance and pensions provider Yapi Kredi Emeklilik AS,\nwith Yapi & Kredi Bankasi keeping 20 percent, Allianz said.  Turkey\u2019s population is expected to become larger than\nGermany\u2019s by the end of 2014, according to the U.S. Census\nBureau. The 99 percent-Muslim nation may have almost 82 million\npeople, overtaking Germany\u2019s 81 million, the bureau said.  The government is also increasing cash incentives for\ncitizens to take out private pensions, introducing legislation\nthis year that raised its contribution.  Health Cover  Yapi Kredi Sigorta increased its premiums 26 percent to\n1.23 billion liras last year. Health insurance accounted for 507\nmillion liras, making it the market leader with a 23 percent\nshare.  Allianz offers health, property insurance, life insurance\nand pensions in  Turkey  with primary business lines being auto\nand health, according to its annual report.  The German firm\u2019s share of health insurance premiums will\nexpand to more than 38 percent after the acquisition, according\nto the insurance association\u2019s figures. Acibadem Saglik & Hayat\nranked second last year with 10 percent, the data showed.  The agreement to buy Yapi Kredi Sigorta requires the\napproval of Turkey\u2019s antitrust regulator.
