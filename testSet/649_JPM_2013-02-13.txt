The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nInversiones Alsacia SA bonds\ntumbled, pushing yields up the most in 15 months, as JPMorgan\nChase & Co. recommended selling the Chilean bus operator\u2019s debt\nand Fitch Ratings said it may lower its rating.  Yields on dollar-denominated notes due 2018 rose 41 basis\npoints, or 0.41 percentage point, to 8.72 percent at 2:02 p.m.\nin Santiago, the biggest increase on a closing basis since\nOctober 2011. The price of the securities dropped 1.72 cents to\n96.92 cents on the dollar.  JPMorgan lowered its recommendation yesterday to the\nequivalent of sell, saying Alsacia\u2019s ability to service its debt\nis deteriorating. Fitch said it may cut the company\u2019s BB\nranking, two levels below investment grade, citing the company\u2019s\nshrinking profit, slower growth and declining demand for bus\ntransportation.  \u201cThe use of reserve funds is imminent,\u201d Fitch analysts\n Astra Castillo  in Monterrey, Mexico, and Omar Valdez in New York\nwrote in a report yesterday. \u201cDebt coverage for the coming\npayments is highly uncertain.\u201d  Telephone calls to Patricio Pinto, Alsacia\u2019s head of\ncorporate affairs, weren\u2019t answered during business hours today.  The company sold $464 million of the bonds two years ago\nwith a yield of 8 percent. That yield was higher than the\nexpected 7.5 percent, spurring Fitch to cut its rating by one\nlevel to BB.  Alsacia\u2019s debt service coverage ratio was 1.12 at the end\nof January, compared with a level of 1.1 that may require the\ncompany to start making early payments, JPMorgan analysts  Daniel Sensel  and  Daniela Savoia  wrote in a research report yesterday.\nJPMorgan and Bank of America Corp. managed the original bond\nsale in 2011.  \u201cEven though we believe the company has enough cash to\ntake care of operating expenses and debt service, we believe\nthere will be some volatility in the short term until there is\nmore clarity about the plans of the company to avoid a possible\nbreak\u201d of the debt ratio in April, Sensel and Savoia wrote.
