 "context": "The following article called 'Businesses Wary as Obama Picks Get Edge in Senate Rules' was published on 2013-11-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPresident Barack Obama will have a stronger hand to push through environmental, financial and other regulations after the Senate voted to let a simple majority confirm most presidential nominees.  Yesterday\u2019s rule change means Obama no longer needs Republican support to win approval of his nominees to run federal agencies and serve on federal trial and appeals courts. There are 231 Obama nominees pending in the Senate, including 53 judges, 81 candidates for cabinet-level agencies and 13 at independent regulatory agencies, according to figures provided by the White House.  Most important, in many ways, are picks to serve on the  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the District of Columbia Circuit, which handles challenges to federal regulations and is called the second-highest court in the country.  \u201cUnder any administration, federal agencies seek to implement the president\u2019s policies by developing regulations,\u201d Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer at Bracewell & Giuliani LLP in Washington who has represented coal-heavy utilities, said. \u201cBut in most cases, the judges on the D.C. Circuit are the people who decide whether those regulations comply with federal law.\u201d  Among the cases being reviewed by the court is one on the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules requiring Internet-service providers such as  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and Comcast Corp. to treat all traffic equally, a goal of  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)   Three Vacancies  The court -- which has three vacancies and where Republicans now have an edge -- also would probably rule on the administration\u2019s proposal to limit carbon-dioxide pollution from  power plants . Those rules are under development by the Environmental Protection Agency now, and may not be ripe for a legal challenge for more than a year.  Related News: Groups representing coal producers such as  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  and  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  have tried to fight off EPA regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. They argue the EPA\u2019s proposed standard relies on a technology that\u2019s not commercially available.  The change in Senate procedure \u201ccan only result in more bad news for the energy industry as EPA will likely be be even more bold in attempting to run roughshod over state rights,\u201d Laura Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said in an e-mail.  Impartial Judiciary  Any of the financial regulations soon to be issued could be affected by this change to the D.C. Circuit, said  Jaret Seiberg , a financial services policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC\u2019s Washington Research Group. Possible challenges, he said, could come to the so-called Volcker Rule, which would curb proprietary trading by banks.  \u201cFor the most part, liberal judges give regulators more leeway to interpret the law,\u201d Seiberg said in an interview. \u201cIf the president does get more judges on the court, the incentive would be less to\u201d even file a legal challenge, he said.  Nine nominations at four financial regulators, including those implementing Dodd-Frank legislation and the Volcker rule, are more likely to move forward with the rule change, according to Bloomberg Government senior finance policy analyst Cady North.  Democratic Appointees  It\u2019s not necessarily the case that the political affiliation of the president who appointed a judge will determine how they rule in any one case. For example, unanimous panels appointed by a mix of Republican and Democratic Senators voted to overturn a George W. Bush-era environmental rule on power plants, saying it wasn\u2019t strong enough, and upheld the ability of Obama\u2019s EPA to regulate greenhouse gases.  \u201cIt\u2019s not as determinative as some people would lead you to believe,\u201d Scott Schang, executive vice president of the Environmental Law Institute, said. Schang\u2019s group did a study of a subset of 325 environmental cases and found that judges appointed by Democrats side with environmental groups 60 percent of time, while Republicans do 28 percent of the time.  During almost five years in office, Obama has placed only a single judge, Sri Srinivasan, on the D.C. Circuit. Srinivasan was confirmed in May after Obama\u2019s first nominee, Caitlin Halligan, was blocked by Senate Republicans. They objected to Halligan\u2019s work as  New York  State\u2019s solicitor general on a lawsuit against handgun manufacturers.  \u201cAnti-Business\u201d Regulation  In June, Obama asked the Senate to confirm Georgetown University Law Professor Nina Pillard and U.S. District Judge Robert Wilkins, as well as Washington attorney Patricia Millett, for the vacancies on the appeals court. Those nominations are now on track to win confirmation.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to get approved,\u201d said Senator  Charles Grassley  of Iowa, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cAnd when they get approved, then you\u2019ll have a rubber stamp for his anti-business regulations.\u201d  The Senate vote yesterday eliminated a delaying tactic known as a filibuster for all nominations exception those to the  Supreme Court . Republicans called it the most dangerous revision of Senate processes in more than two centuries.  The change enacted yesterday doesn\u2019t affect the deference given by custom to senators to sign off nominees to federal judgeships in their home states. That custom has been particularly important in  Arizona  and Texas, states with two Republicans senators and multiple vacancies.  Senate Holds  Nor does it technically affect the traditional Senate practice of placing a \u201chold\u201d on a nominee. However, in recent years Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat, has abandoned the practice of not bringing to the floor nominees with holds on them.  Obama will have more latitude to make \u201cextreme\u201d nominations in the future, said Curt Levey, executive director of the Committee for Justice, which has opposed many of the administration\u2019s nominations. The threat of a filibuster had previously constrained the administration, Levey said.  \u201cThat effect, frankly, is gone,\u201d Levey said. \u201cHe knows that there\u2019s absolutely nothing that anyone on the Hill, or off the Hill, can do.\u201d  Liberal interest groups have urged Obama to make bolder choices for the judiciary, along the lines of Goodwin Liu, whose nomination for the federal appeals court in  San Francisco  was blocked in 2011.  Liu Nomination  Republicans said Liu had activist judicial views and would support expanded welfare, gay-marriage and privacy rights. Democratic backers pointed to Liu\u2019s years of scholarship as a law professor at the  University of California . Liu now serves on the California Supreme Court.  \u201cGoodwin Liu was an extremely highly qualified nominee who should have been confirmed,\u201d said Caroline Fredrickson, president of the American Constitution Society, a network of progressive lawyers and law students. \u201cIf that\u2019s the terrible outcome, bring it on.\u201d  Federal appeals courts now have 18 open seats, and Obama has made nominations for 10 of those slots. In addition, some judges may take on semi-retired senior status -- creating additional vacancies -- now that prospects for confirmation of a successor have improved, said  Tom Goldstein , an appellate lawyer whose Scotusblog website tracks the Supreme Court.  \u201cThis is the most exciting moment for liberal advocacy groups concerned with the courts ever,\u201d Goldstein said.  Shared Blame  Obama has said both parties share blame for the political conflict over judicial nominees. In 2007, then-Senator Obama joined two rivals for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination -- Senators  Joe Biden  and  Hillary Clinton  -- in supporting an unsuccessful filibuster against one of Bush\u2019s appellate court nominations.  The fallout that may follow yesterday\u2019s vote may undermine prospects for a functioning government, business groups said.  \u201cAn increase in bitter partisanship would not bode well for the business of running the country,\u201d said Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, the Arlington, Virginia-based trade group whose members include  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  \u201cIt\u2019s in our country\u2019s best interests for members of Congress to work together on the challenges facing our nation.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Drajem in Washington at  mdrajem@bloomberg.net ; Greg Stohr in Washington at  gstohr@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jon Morgan at  jmorgan97@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Lockheed Martin Corporation was 110.08385467529297 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Lockheed Martin Corporation was ",
