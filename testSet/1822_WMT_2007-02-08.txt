The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWal-Mart de Mexico SA ,  Latin\nAmerica 's biggest retailer, posted its smallest profit increase\nin a year by cutting prices to take market share from\ncompetitors.  \n Net income rose 19 percent to 4.38 billion pesos ($400\nmillion), or 51 centavos a share, from 3.68 billion pesos, or 43\ncentavos a share a year ago, the company said in an e-mail\ntoday. Walmex, as the company is known, is based in  Mexico  City.  \n The retailer intends to counter slowing growth by opening a\nbank after June, said Jose Miguel Garaicochea, who helps manage\n$1.1 billion at Santander Fondos in Mexico City. The bank will\nattract customers to its stores and encourage spending, said\nanalysts including Eduardo Estrada of Citigroup Global Markets.  \n ``Walmex can grow very rapidly in the banking sector,''\nsaid Garaicochea, who holds Walmex shares in his fund. ``Once\nthey get the bank format right, they will quickly replicate\nit.''  \n Sales at Walmex stores open for at least a year rose 7.1\npercent in the fourth quarter. Meantime, supermarket and store\nchains that compete against Walmex posted an increase in same-\nstore sales of 1.9 percent, according to the National\nAssociation of Supermarket and Department Stores.  \n Walmex doesn't belong to the trade group, which includes\nControladora Comercial Mexicana SAB, Organizacion Soriana SAB\nand Grupo Gigante SAB.  \n Walmex said today same-store  sales  grew 5.4 percent in\nJanuary. All percentage increases for\nWalmex and competitors are adjusted for inflation.  \n Economic Expansion  \n Mexico's $833 billion economy expanded at least 4.3\npercent, according to finance ministry estimates published Jan.\n31.  \n Shares of Walmex, Mexico's second largest company by market\nvalue, fell 0.7 percent to 48.88 pesos today in Mexico City\ntrading before the earnings release. That reduced this year's\ngains to 2.8 percent.  \n The stock rose 27 percent in the fourth quarter, the\nbiggest quarterly gain since 1999. The country's benchmark Bolsa\nindex gained 21 percent in the period.  \n Bentonville, Arkansas-based  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  owns two-\nthirds of Walmex.  \n Fourth-quarter revenue, including sales at all stores and\nmembership fees, rose 16 percent to 60.8 billion pesos, Walmex\nsaid today. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization rose 20 percent to 6.63 billion pesos.  \n Banking Push  \n Chief Executive Eduardo Solorzano, 49, is entering the\nbanking market to boost sales and earnings growth. Walmex was\ngranted a full-service banking license in December, beating its\nU.S. parent, whose application was put on hold for a year by\nregulators on Jan. 31.  \n The company plans to set up branches at all of its stores,\nexcluding restaurants, and will initially offer  savings accounts \nand small loans to individuals and small companies, Solorzano\nsaid in November. Walmex had 576 stores and 319 restaurants as\nof Dec. 31.  \n ``The bank will boost traffic and customer loyalty,'' said\nEduardo Estrada, who is based in Mexico City.  \n By running the bank out of its stores, Walmex probably will\nhave the lowest cost within the banking industry and will be\nable to tap into lower-income consumers who aren't served by\ntraditional lenders, wrote Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst  Robert Ford  in a Jan. 5 report. He estimates the bank may net $400\nmillion in five years of operation.  \n About 80 percent of Mexico's 25.8 million households had\naccess to financial services, according to a 2004 survey by the\ngovernment's statistics agency.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nAdriana Arai in Mexico City \n aarai1@bloomberg.net   \n To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nMichael Nol at   mnol@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 34.637027740478516 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
