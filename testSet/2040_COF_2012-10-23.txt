 "context": "The following article called 'Banks Say Regulators Should Rewrite Basel III Capital Rules' was published on 2012-10-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. banks are protesting capital\nrules proposed by regulators to comply with international\nstandards and have asked that rules for assessing risk in their\nassets be replaced with something easier to follow.  As written, the plans could \u201chinder credit availability,\ndampen economic growth and harm the competitiveness of the U.S.\nbanking system,\u201d according to a letter sent by financial\nindustry groups to the  Federal Reserve , Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorp. -- the agencies that put out so-called Basel III proposals\nfor a public-comment period ending yesterday.  The regulators proposed a tighter bank-capital regime in\nJune to comply with an international agreement drawn up by the\n Basel Committee on Banking Supervision . The measures, adopted\nafter the 2008 global financial crisis, are meant to make banks\nless vulnerable in future emergencies. They call for all U.S.\nbanks to maintain \u201closs-absorbing capital\u201d of at least 7\npercent of risk-weighted assets.  \u201cThe proposals would have been more effective, with fewer\nnegative consequences, if the agencies had first conducted an\nempirical study of the impact of the proposals on all segments\nof the U.S. banking sector,\u201d according to the 181-page letter\nfrom the  American Bankers Association , Financial Services\nRoundtable and the Securities Industry & Financial Markets\nAssociation. The groups also suggested the proposal for risk-\nweighting assets \u201cshould be simplified and easier to follow and\nimplement\u201d and that banks need at least a year to implement\nfinal rules.  No \u2018Justification\u2019  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said in a letter dated yesterday\nthat banks \u201cshould not be penalized by a five-fold increase in\nrequired capital\u201d because they have financial relationships\nwith brokers, as the proposals call for. There is no\n\u201cdiscernible reasonable justification\u201d for subjecting broker-\ndealers to a much higher risk weighting than exposure to U.S.\nbanking units, the letter said.  Several of the top 20 U.S. banks by assets, including\n Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) ,  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  and  Regions\nFinancial Corp. (RF) , filed a joint letter that also asked for an\nimpact study and that banks be given at least six months to meet\nthe capital rules, as well as another two years after that to\nimplement the standardized approach to risk-weighted assets.  \u201cIt is difficult to actually create or adopt any systems\nuntil the final rule is published because making changes to such\ntechnology after-the-fact is materially more expensive than\nwaiting to have all the details,\u201d the banks said in the letter,\ndated yesterday.  Levels \u2018Too Low\u2019  Marcus Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial\nReform, said that the proposals\u2019 capital levels are\n\u201csignificantly too low\u201d and banks \u201ccan play games\u201d because\nof the complexity of measuring risk-adjusted capital in the\nproposals. Stanley, whose Washington-based group advocates for\nmore aggressive financial regulations, said the proposed rules\nmaintain the risk that banks will overextend themselves as they\ndid before the crisis.  The June proposals pushed the stronger capital rules down\nto even the smallest banks. The  Independent Community Bankers of\nAmerica  argued in its own letter yesterday that the Basel\nstandards were \u201cnever intended to apply to a domestic community\nbank.\u201d  Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee,\nincluding Chairman  Spencer Bachus  of  Alabama  and  Jeb Hensarling \nof  Texas , urged regulators to avoid a \u201cone size fits all\u201d\napproach on Basel and to instead tailor the requirements for\ncommunity and regional banks.  \u2018Serious Concerns\u2019  \u201cWhile the higher  capital requirements  contained in Basel\nIII are entirely appropriate for large, internationally active\nfinancial institutions that may pose a systemic risk to our\neconomy, the application of these requirements to community and\nregional banks raises serious concerns,\u201d the Republican\nlawmakers wrote regulators in an Oct. 18 letter.  Comptroller of the Currency  Thomas Curry  said in a speech\ntoday that community banks were included in the rules because\nthey are not immune to failure.  \u201cWe need to keep in mind that over 400 community banks and\nthrifts have failed since 2008, and ultimately, they failed\nbecause they didn\u2019t have enough capital for the risks they\ntook,\u201d he said at a banker event in Miami. Curry said last week\nthat smaller U.S. banks may get longer transition periods and\nso-called grandfather clauses to help ease them into compliance\nand that regulators would be \u201cthinking broadly about ways to\nreduce regulatory burden.\u201d  Cost-Benefit Analysis  Senate Banking Committee ranking member  Richard Shelby , a\nRepublican from Alabama, said in a letter last week it\u2019s\n\u201cimperative\u201d that regulators provide Congress and the public\nwith a cost-benefit analysis.  The ABA and other groups said the U.S. banking sector\nalready upped its Tier 1 capital measure from a pre-crisis 7.5\npercent in 2007 to 12.7 percent last year.  \u201cRather than being a buffer to economic turbulence, this\nplan would cause capital to amplify economic volatility, making\nit more difficult for banks to serve customers in hard times and\nmore expensive in even the best economic conditions,\u201d said\n Frank Keating , president and chief executive officer of the\nWashington-based ABA, in a statement. \u201cBasel III would punish\ninstitutions that make mortgage and small business lending a\nsignificant part of their operations.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nJesse Hamilton in Washington at \n jhamilton33@bloomberg.net ;\nCheyenne Hopkins in Washington at \n chopkins19@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Maura Reynolds  at \n mreynolds34@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Capital One Financial Corporation was 51.22540283203125 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Capital One Financial Corporation was ",
