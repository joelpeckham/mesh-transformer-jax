 "context": "The following article called 'Life Insurance Unit Sales Threaten Credit Ratings, Moody\u2019s Says' was published on 2013-11-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSales of U.S. units by insurers such\nas  Aviva Plc (AV/)  and Sun Life Financial Inc. may pressure the credit\nratings of subsidiaries that could be divested by other\ncompanies, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said today in a report.  Moody\u2019s often gives subsidiaries higher ratings than they\nwould merit on their own, based on the strength of parent\ncompanies, the ratings firm said. The divestitures of units once\nseen as important calls into question whether the extra benefit\nis merited, Moody\u2019s said.  \u201cThis trend challenges the notion of \u2018strategic\nsubsidiary\u2019 and the extent of rating uplift from implicit\nparental support,\u201d according to a report from Moody\u2019s analysts\nled by Ann Perry. \u201cThe strategic importance of subsidiaries can\nlack permanence.\u201d  Moody\u2019s has downgraded subsidiaries following divestitures\nby five insurers over the past year, according to the report.\n Sun Life (SLF) \u2019s former U.S. unit saw its financial-strength rating\ncut by two levels after the Toronto-based company announced a\ndeal to sell the business to investors tied to Guggenheim\nPartners LLC. An insurer owned by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  was\nlowered one grade as the bank divested about 80 percent.  \u201cSome companies that historically provided implicit and\nexplicit support to strategically significant subsidiaries are\ndivesting these operations,\u201d Moody\u2019s said. Divestitures have\nbeen fueled by \u201cchronic underperformance, shifts over time in\nenterprise priorities/strategies, and rationalization of legal\nentities.\u201d  Aviva, Axa  Other former subsidiaries that saw downgrades include units\nof Paris-based  Axa SA (CS) ,  London \u2019s Aviva, and  Allstate Corp. (ALL) \nDiscretion Winter, a spokeswoman for Axa\u2019s U.S. unit, declined\nto comment on the Moody\u2019s report. Axa reached a deal this year\nto sell some obligations tied to policies issued in past years.\nThe deal with Protective Life Corp. helped free up capital, the\nFrench company has said.  U.S. life insurance sales are \u201cabsolutely core to our U.S.\nbusiness strategy,\u201d Winter said.  Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG) ,  Prudential Plc (PRU) ,\nManulife Financial Corp. and  Allianz SE (ALV)  are among insurers with\nsubsidiaries that benefit from parental support, Moody\u2019s said.\nTom Hambrick, a spokesman for Hartford, which is based in the\nConnecticut city of the same name, had no immediate comment.  Allianz is committed to bolstering operations in the U.S.,\nGary Bhojwani, the management board member responsible for the\nMunich-based company\u2019s U.S. insurance business, said in an\ninterview this month.  Tidjane Thiam, the chief executive officer of London-based\nPrudential, said this month that the Jackson National Life U.S.\nunit has a \u201cgreat future\u201d with the company.
