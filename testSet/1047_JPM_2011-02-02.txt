 "context": "The following article called 'Treasury Advisory Panel Suggests \u2018Ultra-Long\u2019 Debt' was published on 2011-02-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe committee of bond dealers and\ninvestors that advises the  U.S. Treasury  suggested the\ngovernment consider adding \u201cultra-long\u201d bonds of as much as\n100 years to tap into investor demand.  The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, known as TBAC,\nsuggested the U.S. investigate additional types of securities\nthat would target banks, pension funds, insurance companies and\nindividual investors. A presentation from one member, offered on\nbehalf of the panel, estimated $2.4 trillion in potential demand\nfrom these investors over the next five years.  The \u201cultra-long\u201d bonds proposed were defined as debt with\na maturity of 40-, 50-, or 100 years, according to comments from\none member as reported in the minutes of yesterday\u2019s meeting,\nwhich the Treasury published today. In a press conference,\nTreasury officials said elements of the plan are worth studying,\nif not 100-year bonds themselves.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that there is much benefit to going out\nthat long,\u201d  Mary Miller , the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for\nfinancial markets, said at a news conference today in  Washington . \u201cThere might be some benefit at looking at some\nlonger maturities, but probably not anywhere near that ultimate\nlength.\u201d  The Treasury is in the midst of financing its third\nconsecutive $1 trillion-plus  budget deficit , which has required\nacross-the-board increases in sales of bills, notes and bonds.  Record Demand  The rise in issuance hasn\u2019t hurt demand. The Treasury\nreceived about $2.99 in bids for each dollar of debt it sold in\n2010, the highest ratio on record since at least 1994, when the\ngovernment began releasing data for all maturities. That was up\nfrom $2.50 in 2009.  \u201cIt\u2019s a topic worth investigating for the Treasury,\u201d said  Lou Crandall , chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC in  Jersey\nCity ,  New Jersey . He said there is a large structural demand for\nvery long-term debt instruments and a limited number of issuers\nwho can plausibly tap that market.\u2019\u2019  The longest maturity Treasury security is 30 years. After\nthe savings and loan crisis in the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S.\nsold Resolution Funding Corp., or REFCorp, bonds of up to 40\nyears.  Forty-year bonds have been offered recently in the U.K.,\nJapan and  Peru . And in October 2010, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\nsold $1.3 billion of 50-year debt in an offering aimed at\nindividual U.S. investors.  Other Alternatives  The panel\u2019s presentation indicated Treasury could benefit\nfrom adding securities such as floating rate notes, products\nwith embedded options, and interest rate derivatives, according\nto documents released by the Treasury. It also urged the\nTreasury to consider its mix of foreign and domestic investment.  \u201cGiven the high concentration of foreign ownership,\nTreasury may wish to focus on alternative domestic sources of\ndebt placement,\u201d the TBAC wrote in its presentation to the\nTreasury.  About half of the Treasury\u2019s $8.86 trillion in marketable\ndebt is held by foreign investors.  China , the biggest\ninternational holder, owned $895.6 billion as of November,\naccording to Treasury data.  The Treasury documents don\u2019t say which member offered the\npresentation or whether the rest of the panel agreed with its\nconclusions. The proposal generated \u201can energetic discussion\u201d\nabout the merits of different debt instruments and the committee\nrecommended further review, the minutes said.  Treasury Committee  Matthew Zames, a managing director at JPMorganChase & Co.,\nis the chairman of the 13-member advisory panel. It also\nincludes executives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Royal\nBank of Scotland Group Plc, Bank of America Corp., Moore Capital\nManagement Inc. and Tudor Investment Corp.  All members were present except for Keith Anderson of Soros\nFund Management LLC, according to the Treasury\u2019s minutes.  Treasury officials said at today\u2019s press conference that\nthey would want to make sure that any new securities were\noffered in a way that took liquidity and other operational\nissues into account.  The market might not need additional long-term debt beyond\nwhat\u2019s already on offer, said Amitabh Arora, an interest rate\nstrategist in  New York  at Citigroup Inc., one of the 18 primary\ndealers that trade with the Fed.  \u201cThe discussion of long maturities is a little baffling,\u201d\nArora said. \u201cIf they issued more 30-year paper, that would\nsuffice.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nLiz Capo McCormick in New York at \n emccormick7@bloomberg.net ;  Rebecca Christie  in Washington at \n rchristie4@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDave Liedtka at   dliedtka@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 33.96458435058594 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
