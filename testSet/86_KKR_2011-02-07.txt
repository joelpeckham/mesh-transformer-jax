The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBlackstone Group LP  agreed to buy a\nmajority stake in  Strategic Hotels & Resorts Inc .\u2019s Hotel del\nCoronado to help restructure the debt on the Southern California\nresort that was the backdrop of the film \u201cSome Like it Hot.\u201d  Strategic Hotels formed a joint venture with Blackstone\nReal Estate Advisors and KSL Resorts, investing an undisclosed\namount of cash into the luxury hotel and converting a portion of\nthe existing debt into equity, Chicago-based Strategic said in a\nstatement today. Deutsche Bank AG provided $425 million in debt\nfinancing. KKR & Co. sold its 41 percent stake in the hotel as\npart of the transaction, according to Kristi Huller, a\nspokeswoman for the New York-based firm.  The 670-room Hotel del Coronado, located on 28 acres of\noceanfront property near  San Diego , has hosted 11 U.S.\npresidents and celebrities including  Marilyn Monroe , Madonna and  Brad Pitt , according to its website. The transaction values the\nhotel at about $590 million, Strategic Hotels said. That is less\nthan the $745 million the company bought it for in 2005, said\nAlan Reay, president at  Irvine , California-based Atlas\nHospitality Group.  \u201cThe San Diego market has started to rebound, and more\nimportantly, the luxury hotel sector has rebounded very\nstrongly,\u201d Reay said in a telephone interview. \u201cFor Blackstone\nthis is an excellent investment. The Coronado is an\nirreplaceable asset. It\u2019s world famous. They are getting in at a\nmuch lower price than what Strategic purchased it at.\u201d  Luxury Rebound  Luxury hotels have shown the biggest increases during the\nrecovery of the last year, after being hurt more than their\ncheaper competitors by the recession. Occupancy at high-end\nhotels climbed to 66 percent in 2010 from 61 percent the prior\nyear, according to  Smith Travel Research Inc . That compares with\na 64 percent occupancy rate in 2010 for all hotels in the top 25\nU.S. markets.  The Hotel del Coronado had a total loan balance of $630\nmillion, according to Realpoint LLC. The debt was due to expire\nin mid-February after receiving an extension last month.  Blackstone, which in December took ownership of 14 hotels\nit sold to Columbia Sussex Corp. five years ago, will hold a 60\npercent ownership interest and will become general manager.\nStrategic, as asset manager, and KSL, as operator, will hold\n34.3 percent and 5.7 percent stakes, respectively.  \u201cWe are very pleased by this outcome, as it provides the\nopportunity for us to achieve attractive returns on our new\ninvestment, significantly reduces the hotel\u2019s indebtedness and\nmaintains our ownership in this iconic asset,\u201d Strategic Chief\nExecutive Officer Laurence Geller said in the statement.  Strategic\u2019s Fairmont Scottsdale Princess in  Arizona  and the\nInterContinental Miami also have loans with maturities this\nyear, Strategic said in October.
