 "context": "The following article called 'Real Bonds Post Biggest Loss Since May on Inflation Concern: Brazil Credit' was published on 2010-11-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrazilian  real bonds  are posting the\nbiggest monthly loss since May as accelerating  inflation  sparks\nspeculation the central bank will be forced to raise interest\nrates after President-elect  Dilma Rousseff  takes office.  The 1.5 percent  decline  in Brazil\u2019s local-currency debt\ncompares with an  average  loss of 1.4 percent for developing-\nnation debt in the month ended yesterday, according to JPMorgan\nChase & Co. indexes.  Consumer prices  in Latin America\u2019s biggest economy climbed\nmore than forecast in October, driving annual inflation to a\nfive-month high of 5.2 percent. Yields on real bonds due in 2021\nsurged 93 basis points, or 0.93 percentage point, in the past\nmonth as Rousseff said she\u2019ll boost payouts to the poor and may\nraise the minimum wage more than planned. Mexican peso bond\nyields rose 43 basis points in the same period.  \u201cInflation expectations are ticking higher and it seems\nlike the central bank is not going to do anything about it,\u201d\nsaid  Edwin Gutierrez , who helps manage $6 billion in emerging-\nmarket debt at Aberdeen Management Plc in London.  Yields on interest-rate futures due in January 2012 surged\n34 basis points in the past month to 11.66 percent, signaling\ntraders expect the central bank will raise the benchmark rate to\nabout 12.5 percent by the end of next year from 10.75 percent,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Prices  as measured by the benchmark IPCA index rose 0.75\npercent in October, fueled by food costs, the national\nstatistics agency said Nov. 9. The increase was higher than the\nmedian forecast of 0.67 percent among 41 analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg and surpassed all but one estimate.  Inflation Outlook  Inflation  will quicken to 5.48 percent by year-end, the\nhighest rate since July 2010, according to a central bank survey\nof economists released Nov. 16. A week earlier, the median\nforecast was 5.31 percent.  Policy makers are committed to achieving their inflation\ntarget of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points,\nCentral Bank President  Henrique Meirelles  said in an interview\nwith Globo News television on Oct. 17.  The central bank said in a statement it doesn\u2019t comment on\nmarket moves or speculation.  Rousseff, President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva \u2019s former\ncabinet chief and handpicked successor, told reporters Nov. 3\nthat she\u2019s considering raising the monthly minimum wage to more\nthan 700 reais ($409) by 2014 from 510 reais today. The increase\nis more than the 5.5 percent proposed in the government\u2019s 2011\nbudget. Lula increased spending 27 percent in the first nine\nmonths of this year.  \u2018Policy Direction\u2019  \u201cThere\u2019s uncertainty about policy direction moving forward\nas the leadership of the economic team and the central bank\nmembers is unknown and the fact that inflation is a little\nhigher,\u201d said  Paul Biszko , an emerging-markets strategist at\nRBC Capital Markets in Toronto.  Lula\u2019s tripling of a tax on foreigners\u2019 fixed-income\npurchases to 6 percent on Oct. 19 to slow the rally in the real\nis also reducing demand for Brazil\u2019s bonds, said  Kathy Jones , an\nemerging-markets bond strategist at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney,\nwhich manages $1.6 trillion.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters in Brasilia\non Oct. 25 that the tax increase was working to curb investment\nin the debt market and stem the real\u2019s gains.  \u201cAt 2 percent it wasn\u2019t so bad, but at 6 percent it\u2019s not\nmaking sense to take the currency risk,\u201d said New York-based\nJones. \u201cWe\u2019re a little more cautious now then we have been. We\nreached the level of fair value.\u201d  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.7156 per dollar by 4:45 p.m.\nNew York time.  Yield Spread  The extra yield investors demand to hold Brazilian dollar\nbonds instead of U.S. Treasuries was unchanged at 175 basis\npoints, according to JPMorgan.  The cost of protecting Brazilian debt against non-payment\nfor five years with credit-default swaps fell two basis points\nto 108, according to data compiled by CMA. Credit-default swaps\npay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying\nsecurities or the cash equivalent should a government or company\nfail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Yields on interest-rate futures due in January 2012 rose 2\nbasis points today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inflation will slow in the first three months of next year,\nallowing the central bank to lower interest rates, said  Aloisio Teles , co-head of emerging-market trading at Nomura Securities\nInternational Inc. in New York.  \u201cThey were expecting these levels, so it\u2019s not new and by\nnext year inflation will go down,\u201d Teles said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty\nmuch noise and speculation about the new government and it\ngenerates great opportunity in Brazil.\u201d  \u2018Cut in 2011\u2019  Rousseff\u2019s efforts to restrain public spending will allow\nthe central bank to cut the benchmark interest rate next year,\nMantega said on Nov. 13.  \u201cI believe the central bank can cut in 2011,\u201d Mantega\nsaid in an interview as he was leaving Seoul after the Group of\n20 Summit. \u201cWe are going to create conditions to open a space\nfor the interest rate to fall. How much it will fall, I don\u2019t\nknow, but I can assure you it will fall.\u201d  Mantega has accepted Rousseff\u2019s invitation to remain in his\nposition, a person familiar with the decision said yesterday.  Rousseff\u2019s transition team won\u2019t comment on speculation and\nthe president will announce her cabinet picks at the appropriate\ntime, said one of her press officers who cannot be identified\nbecause of internal policy.  The Finance Ministry didn\u2019t respond to a telephone call and\nan e-mail seeking comment.  \u2018Lot of Pressure\u2019  Policy makers boosted the  benchmark rate  by 200 basis\npoints from a record low of 8.75 percent in April to cool the\neconomy\u2019s fastest expansion in two decades.  The economy will expand 7.6 percent this year after\nshrinking 0.2 percent in 2009, according to the Nov. 12 central\nbank survey of about 100 economists.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure right now and the inflation\nconcern and lack of demand will push yields higher,\u201d said\n Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America fixed-income research at\nIDEAglobal in New York.
