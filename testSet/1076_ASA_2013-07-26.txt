 "context": "The following article called 'Exim Seeks Clout in Myanmar as China Pours Cash: Corporate India' was published on 2013-07-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMyanmar, called Asia\u2019s \u201cnext\neconomic frontier\u201d by the International Monetary Fund, is the\nnew battleground for Indian companies seeking to wrest business\nfrom Chinese firms.  Export-Import Bank of India, the state-controlled trade\nfinancing institution, has pledged $800 million in Myanmar,\nwhich includes funds to upgrade the Yangon-Mandalay railway and\na plant for  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  to assemble vehicles in the\nSoutheast Asian nation, Executive Director David Rasquinha said.\n China , which has beaten Indian companies in the race to invest\nin energy assets from Kazakhstan to  Venezuela , has agreed to\nlend more than $2.4 billion in Myanmar.  Exim Bank of India faces an uneven contest as  China\nDevelopment Bank Corp. , which has a loan book more than three\ntimes the size of the World Bank, and the Export-Import Bank of\nChina offer cheap loans to snare business. The Indian lender\nplans to sign credit agreements of as much as $500 million by\nnext month to participate in an economy that the IMF forecasts\nwill expand 7 percent over the next five years.  \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t get pessimistic because competition is\nthere,\u201d Rasquinha said in an interview in Mumbai. \u201cWe should\nbe seeing the size of the pie and fighting smart.\u201d  State-run Chinese companies have spent $19.5 billion this\nyear acquiring energy and resources assets overseas versus\nIndia\u2019s single $2.5 billion investment by  Oil & Natural Gas\nCorp. (ONGC)   Gas Pipeline  China Development Bank signed a $2.4 billion loan agreement\nwith Myanmar\u2019s Foreign Investment Bank in 2010, according to\nMyanmar Times, to help fund a natural gas pipeline between the\ntwo countries. In May 2011, the bank agreed to provide Myanmar\u2019s\nMinistry of Taxation and Finance with a 540 million euro ($718\nmillion) line of credit during a meeting between Myanmar\nPresident Thein Sein and former Chinese President Hu Jintao.  Yields on Mumbai-based Exim Bank\u2019s 4 percent dollar-denominated notes maturing January 2023 fell 16 basis points,\nthe most in more than two weeks, to 5.27 percent today,\naccording to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices.  Exim Bank has been focusing on  Africa . About 60 percent of\nthe Indian lender\u2019s lines of credit are for countries in the\ncontinent, Rasquinha said. Export-Import Bank has so far signed\n172 lines of credit with commitments of about $10.5 billion,\ncovering 75 nations, he said. That compares with a $219 billion\nloan book at  Exim Bank of China .  Indian Exim Bank in part helped boost India\u2019s trade with\nAfrica, according to a report by the lender. The South Asian\nnation was Africa\u2019s fourth-largest trading partner as of 2011,\nwith $63 billion trade. That compares with business valued at\n$5.2 billion in 2001, the lender\u2019s data show.  \u2018Big Pie\u2019  \u201cNo single country and no matter whichever country, can\nprovide that kind of funds to Africa,\u201d Rasquinha said. \u201cThe\npie is so big that there is room for all of us.\u201d  Rasquinha cites a World Bank study that Africa needs about\n$50 billion every year for developing its infrastructure.\nExport-Import Bank signed a $216 million of lines of credit with\n Mozambique  this month, according to a statement on the lender\u2019s\nwebsite.  The lender expects to mirror some of its African success in\nMyanmar. Exim Bank is trying to \u201cexcite\u201d Indian companies to\nconduct business in Myanmar, Rasquinha said. The lender charges\na floating 50 basis point over the London interbank offered rate\nto a fixed 2 percent on overseas lines of credit, Rasquinha\nsaid.  India in 2010 approved plans by state-owned ONGC and GAIL\nIndia Ltd. to invest a combined $1.3 billion in natural gas\nprojects in Myanmar.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , India\u2019s biggest\nengineering company, is \u201cdiscussing about some things but they\nare at a very initial stage,\u201d Chief Financial Officer R. Shankar Raman said.  Democratic Process  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India\u2019s biggest mobile carrier, was\namong companies that had bid for a telecom license in Myanmar,\nthe nation\u2019s selection committee said on its website in April.\nNorway\u2019s Telenor ASA and Ooredoo QSC of Qatar won licenses to\nexpand telecommunications in Myanmar, one of the world\u2019s last\nremaining untapped markets where only about one in 10 people has\na mobile phone.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  in July 2012 authorized the\nnation\u2019s companies to invest in Myanmar after President Thein Sein started a democratic process that saw opposition leader\nAung San Suu Kyi elected to parliament following years of house\narrest and prompted visits by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron\nand  India \u2019s Manmohan Singh.  Myanmar needs $650 billion of investments by 2030 to\nsupport an 8 percent gross domestic product growth potential,\naccording to McKinsey Global Institute, the research unit of\nMcKinsey & Co. Global companies wanting to do business in\nMyanmar, that seeks to emerge from 50 years of economic and\npolitical isolation, will need to deal with the military\u2019s pace\nof opening the country and corruption in one of Asia\u2019s poorest\ncountries.  Reduce Dependence  The Southeast Asian nation, that shares borders with India\nand China, is  ranked  No. 172 of 176 in Transparency\nInternational\u2019s 2012 corruption perception index.  Myanmar\u2019s liberalization may reduce the nation\u2019s dependence\non China, according to Olivia Boyd, a Beijing-based energy\nanalyst at IHS Global Insight. She cited opposition from local\nresidents against Wanbao Mining Co.\u2019s Latpadaung copper mine as\nan example.  \u201cMyanmar\u2019s dependence on China is lessening,\u201d Boyd said.\n\u201cChinese companies wield less bargaining power, meaning that\nChinese companies may face further contract revision of this\nsort in the future.\u201d  Indian companies may be able to tap part of the business if\nthey take a long-term view, said Rasquinha.  \u201cThe pie is so big that there\u2019s room for all of us,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cChina has large large amounts of money available and can\nlend at very low rates, but they can\u2019t finance every single\nproject.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAnurag Joshi in Mumbai at \n ajoshi53@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nKatrina Nicholas at \n knicholas2@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was 13.264184951782227 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was ",
