 "context": "The following article called 'Banks Forsaking Record Low Yields in Pimco's `New Normal': Credit Markets' was published on 2010-09-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBanks are sitting out the busiest\nSeptember for corporate bond sales in a sign they may refrain\nfrom lending while the Federal Reserve considers how to jolt the\neconomic recovery.  Microsoft Corp. ,  Hewlett-Packard Co.  and  Ford Motor Co.  led\n$124.3 billion of U.S. issuance this month, on pace to beat the\nhigh of $125.1 billion in September 2009, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. Sales by banks and financial companies\naccount for 16 percent of the total, the lowest proportion since\nApril and down from 30 percent a year ago.  While industrial companies take advantage of record-low\nyields, banks continue to retrench in a sluggish economy that\nPacific Investment Management Co. calls \u201cthe new normal.\u201d\nRather than making loans, lenders are plowing cash into\ngovernment securities and letting their balance sheets shrink.  \u201cBanks have raised deposits, they\u2019ve got lots of cash and\nloans have fallen,\u201d said  Jeffrey Meli , co-head of U.S. credit\nstrategy at Barclays Capital in New York. \u201cThey have less need\nfor the money and are happy to be negative net issuers.\u201d  Banks pared commercial and industrial lending to $1.24\ntrillion in the week ended Sept. 8, 11.3 percent lower than a\nyear earlier, Fed data show. At the same time, their holdings of\ngovernment debt rose 14.5 percent to $1.59 trillion.  Floating Rates  Sales of floating-rate notes, preferred by banks, have\nalmost vanished as demand dwindles on speculation the Fed won\u2019t\nraise borrowing costs anytime soon. Companies sold about $5.6\nbillion of floaters due in at least 18 months in the U.S. this\nmonth, accounting for 6.3 percent of investment-grade issuance,\nthe smallest share since October 2008, Bloomberg data show.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors\ndemand to own company bonds instead of similar-maturity\ngovernment debt rose 1 basis point to 173 basis points, or 1.73\npercentage points, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s Global Broad\nMarket Corporate Index shows. Yields averaged 3.465 percent, the\nlowest since Aug. 26.  A benchmark indicator of corporate credit risk in the U.S.\ndeclined for the first time in four days as a report showed\ndemand for capital equipment rebounded in August.  Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America\nInvestment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against\nlosses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,\nfell 4.6 basis points to a mid-price of 109.6 basis points as of\n1:18 p.m. in New York, according to index administrator Markit\nGroup Ltd. The index typically declines as investor confidence\nimproves.  Bondholder Protection  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails\nto meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A\nbasis point, 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a\ncontract protecting $10 million of debt.  Bookings for goods such as computers and communications\ngear climbed 4.1 percent after a 5.3 percent decline in July\nthat was smaller than previously estimated, according to figures\nfrom the Commerce Department issued today in Washington.  Corporate bond sales in the U.S. this week total $33.9\nbillion, exceeding $30 billion for a third consecutive week,\nBloomberg data show. Microsoft,  KKR  -- the private-equity firm\nfounded by buyout pioneers  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts  in\n1976 -- and  DuPont Co.  led at least $23.4 billion of investment-\ngrade offerings, the data show.  Slowing Growth?  Concern the economy will slow and curb credit may be\npropelling companies to borrow at low rates, said  Leslie Barbi ,\na managing director at Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America in\nNew York, who helps oversee $23 billion in fixed-income assets.  \u201cIf you\u2019re an issuer and you think you might want funds at\nany time in the next six or 12 months, I could see how it seems\nlike a very rational decision to say, \u2018Get low rates now,\u2019\u201d\nBarbi said.  Newport Beach, California-based Pimco -- manager of the\nworld\u2019s biggest bond  fund  -- says global growth will be below\nhistorical averages during the next three to five years as\ndeveloped economies struggle with mounting deficits and\nincreased regulation in the wake of the 2008 credit-market\ncollapse.  Applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly\nrose last week, a sign companies remain cautious about hiring.\nInitial jobless claims increased by 12,000 to 465,000 in the\nweek ended Sept. 18, according to Labor Department figures. The\ntotal receiving unemployment insurance declined, while those\ngetting extended payments rose.  \u2018More Stringent\u2019  \u201cBank credit profiles are likely to remain significantly\nmore challenged and uncertain,\u201d said  Peter Aherne , managing\ndirector and head of capital markets and syndicate at Citigroup\nInc. in New York.  Bank bonds yield 232 basis points more than Treasuries,\ncompared with of 181 basis points for investment-grade debt\noverall in the U.S., according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nIndex data. Investors have demanded higher relative yields to\nown bank bonds than non-financial debt since September 2007.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say banks are closed for business, they will\nlend, but the conditions for lending are much more stringent,\u201d\nsaid  Pri De Silva , an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in New York.\n\u201cBanks are still in the process of shrinking and restructuring\ntheir balance sheets, so the need to come to the market to roll\nover their debt has diminished.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Tim Catts  in New York at \n tcatts1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAlan Goldstein at \n agoldstein5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of KKR & Co.
