The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNet earnings of $788 million, including favorable U.S. tax reform impacts 2017 annual ROIC of 6.4 percent, above WACC of 6.0 percent\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n\u201cWe ended 2017 with a solid fourth quarter. We pulled the levers under our control\u2014including cost and capital initiatives and interventions throughout the year\u2014to deliver value for shareholders,\u201d said ADM Chairman and CEO Juan Luciano. \u201cI am also proud that our more than 31,000 colleagues delivered the best quarterly employee safety record in ADM\u2019s history.\u201d\n\u201cFor 2017 as a whole, we grew earnings per share, improved returns on invested capital and generated positive EVA. Looking ahead, we expect improving results through 2018 as our strategy advances. Our increasing international presence, and expanding capabilities in areas such as destination marketing, food and beverage innovation, and health and wellness, all help to position ADM for continued growth and value creation.\u201d\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\n2017 2016 (Amounts in millions except per share data) Earnings per share (as reported) $ 1.39 $ 0.73 Adjusted earnings per share 1 $ 0.82 $ 0.75 Segment operating profit $ 733 $ 806 Adjusted segment operating profit 1 $ 793 $ 827 Agricultural Services 301 245 Corn Processing 261 255 Oilseeds Processing 202 239 WFSI 56 38 Other (27 ) 50 EPS as reported of $1.39 includes a $0.08 per share charge related to asset impairments and restructuring activities and a positive $0.65 per share net tax adjustment primarily related to U.S. tax reform. Adjusted EPS, which excludes these items, was $0.82. 1 During 2017, the company returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\n1 Non-GAAP financial measures; see pages 4, 9 and 10 for explanations and reconciliations, including after-tax amounts.\nResults of Operations\nAg Services results were up over the prior-year period.\nMerchandising and Handling earnings increased year-over-year. The lack of competitiveness of U.S. grain exports was offset by solid performance in Global Trade, strong destination marketing gains, and insurance and other income.\nTransportation results decreased from the prior-year period, due to lower barge loadings and freight values.\nMilling and Other earnings were down year-over-year due to lower volumes and margins.\nCorn Processing results increased over the prior-year fourth quarter. Sweeteners and Starches had another strong quarter, with solid earnings growth over the prior year in both North America and EMEA. Lower year-over-year results in Bioproducts due to lower ethanol margins were partially mitigated by favorable risk management.\nOilseeds Processing results were down compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Crushing and Origination results were lower due to weak crush margins, despite strong crush volumes and continued growth in demand. Origination results in South America were impacted by weak margins.\nRefining, Packaging, Biodiesel and Other experienced lower earnings versus the fourth quarter of 2016, due primarily to weaker biodiesel margins, partially offset by strong refining and packaging results.\nAsia was up slightly over the prior-year period on Wilmar results.\nWFSI results were solid, up versus the prior-year quarter. WILD Flavors delivered double-digit operating profit growth with strong sales across all regions. Specialty Ingredients results were up versus a challenging year-ago period.\nOther results decreased due to unfavorable underwriting performance from the company\u2019s captive insurance operations compared to favorable underwriting income in the prior year period.\nOther Items of Note\nAs additional information to help clarify underlying business performance, the table on page 9 includes reported EPS as well as adjusted EPS.\nSegment operating profit of $733 million for the quarter includes charges of $62 million ($0.07 per share) related to a settlement charge and asset impairment and restructuring charges.\nIn Corporate results, unallocated corporate costs for the quarter decreased due to lower employee costs and the absence of certain costs incurred last year. Minority Interest and Other charges for the quarter include several individually insignificant restructuring charges totaling $7 million ($0.01 per share) compared to last year\u2019s U.S. OPEB curtailment gain of $38 million ($0.04 per share) and restructuring charges of $3 million.\nIncome tax expense for the quarter decreased $379 million ($0.67 per share) due to the estimated effects of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the effects of U.S. tax reform, the Company\u2019s effective tax rate would have been 24 percent for the quarter and year.\nConference Call Information\nADM will host a webcast on February 6, 2018, at 8 a.m. Central Time to discuss financial results and provide a company update.

Adjusted segment operating profit, a non-GAAP measure, is segment operating profit excluding specified items and timing effects. Timing effects relate to hedge ineffectiveness and mark-to-market hedge timing effects. Management believes that segment operating profit and adjusted segment operating profit are useful measures of ADM\u2019s performance because they provide investors information about ADM\u2019s business unit performance excluding corporate overhead costs as well as specified items and significant timing effects. Segment operating profit and adjusted segment operating profit are not measures of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered alternatives to income before income taxes, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, or any other measure of consolidated operating results under U.S. GAAP.

Adjusted EPS reflects ADM\u2019s fully diluted EPS after removal of the effect on EPS as reported of certain specified items as more fully described above. Management believes that Adjusted EPS is a useful measure of ADM\u2019s performance because it provides investors additional information about ADM\u2019s operations allowing better evaluation of underlying business performance and better period-to-period comparability. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to replace or be an alternative to EPS as reported, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, or any other measures of operating results under GAAP. Earnings amounts described above have been divided by the company\u2019s diluted shares outstanding for each respective period in order to arrive at an adjusted EPS amount for each specified item.

Adjusted ROIC earnings is ADM\u2019s net earnings adjusted for the after tax effects of interest expense, changes in the LIFO reserve and other specified items. Adjusted invested capital is the sum of ADM\u2019s equity (excluding noncontrolling interests) and interest-bearing liabilities adjusted for the after tax effect of the LIFO reserve, and other specified items. Management believes Adjusted ROIC is a useful financial measure because it provides investors information about ADM\u2019s returns excluding the impacts of LIFO inventory reserves and other specified items and increases period-to-period comparability of underlying business performance. Management uses Adjusted ROIC to measure ADM\u2019s performance by comparing Adjusted ROIC to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Adjusted ROIC, Adjusted ROIC earnings and Adjusted invested capital are non-GAAP financial measures and are not intended to replace or be alternatives to GAAP financial measures.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180206005424/en/\nArcher Daniels Midland Company\nMedia Relations\nColin McBean\n312-634-8484\nor\nInvestor Relations\nMark Schweitzer\n217-451-8286\nSource: Archer Daniels Midland Company\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. was 15.009027481079102 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. was ",
