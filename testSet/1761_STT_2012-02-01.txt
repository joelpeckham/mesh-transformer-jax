The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMacquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia \u2019s\nbiggest  investment bank , is vying with at least three companies\nto buy asset-management divisions from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , said\ntwo people with knowledge of the matter.  The deadline for second-round offers is next week, and the\nGerman lender plans to reach an agreement by mid-March, said the\npeople, who declined to be identified as talks are private.\nOther bidders include  JPMorgan Chase & Co. ,  State Street Corp. (STT) \nand  Ameriprise Financial Inc. (AMP) , people with knowledge of the\nmatter said last month.  A purchase would help Macquarie build out its asset-\nmanagement business beyond its 2010 purchase of Delaware\nManagement Holdings Inc. from Lincoln National Corp. The\nbusinesses Deutsche Bank put up for sale have almost 400 billion\neuros ($523 billion) in assets under management, the people said\nlast month.  \u201cMacquarie should be interested in this asset,\u201d said\n James Ellis , a bank analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in Sydney.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the areas of clear strategic thrust under  Nicholas Moore ,\u201d Macquarie\u2019s chief executive officer since 2008, Ellis\nsaid.  Shares of Macquarie  slipped  1.9 percent to A$25.02 ($26.72)\nin Sydney today. Deutsche Bank shares  rose  2.6 percent to 33.24\neuros in  Frankfurt  by 12:57 local time.  A Macquarie spokeswoman, Karen Smith, and Klaus Winker, a\nDeutsche Bank spokesman, declined to comment.  Profit Climbs  Profit at Sydney-based Macquarie\u2019s asset-management\ndivision almost doubled in the six months ended Sept. 30 from\nthe same period a year earlier, helping offset an 18 percent\nslump in trading income from the fixed-income, currencies and\ncommodities units, the company said in October.  Deutsche Bank (DBK)  announced the review of the asset-management\nunits, excluding the operations of the DWS mutual-fund units in\nEurope and  Asia , in November. The divisions may fetch 1.5\nbillion euros to 2.5 billion euros, people with knowledge of the\nmatter said last month. Deutsche Bank would prefer to sell the\nbusiness as a whole, though it is also accepting offers for\nparts of the business, the people said.  The businesses for sale include DB Advisors, an\ninstitutional money-management unit, which has 163 billion euros\nin client assets; Deutsche Insurance Asset Management oversees\n142 billion euros; the RREEF unit, which specializes in real-\nestate and infrastructure investments, has 45 billion euros; and\nDWS in the Americas has about 42 billion euros.  Deutsche Bank\u2019s entire asset-management unit, including the\nDWS businesses being kept, reported nine-month pretax profit of\n316 million euros, up 83 percent from the year-earlier period.\nKevin Parker, head of asset management, cut costs and headcount\nby about a third from 2007 to 2010 while exiting businesses not\nconsidered strategically relevant to boost profit.  The German lender needs to raise 3.2 billion euros after\n Europe \u2019s top regulator asked the region\u2019s banks to bolster their\ncapital buffers amid the sovereign debt crisis.  Macquarie, regulated by the Australia\u2019s banking watchdog,\nhad A$3.5 billion in capital surplus above minimum requirements,\nthe bank said Oct. 28.
