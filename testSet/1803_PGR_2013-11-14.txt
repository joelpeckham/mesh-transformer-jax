(PGR)  said its\ntechnology that tracks driver behavior to set insurance rates\nwill help the company adapt as automated cars take the road.  The auto insurer offers a device called Snapshot, which\nplugs into a vehicle and monitors habits to calculate discounts\nfor customers. As cars become more automated, the technology\ncould be used by underwriters to design policies, Chief\nExecutive Officer Glenn Renwick said today.  \u201cIt gives us some very direct insight to the vehicle,\u201d he\nsaid during a conference call. \u201cThat gives us opportunities to\nthink about things differently, what might be insurable.\u201d  Cars that allow motorists to read e-mails or watch a video\nwhile being ferried to their destination are still years away\nfrom widespread adoption. Still, automakers including  General\nMotors Co. (GM)  and Daimler AG are starting to roll out systems that\ntake over the wheel in some instances. Nissan Motor Co. plans to\nbring affordable, fully autonomous vehicles to market by 2020.  Such developments could challenge auto insurers\u2019 business,\nmuch the way that digital photography and video transformed the\nfilm-camera industry, Renwick said. Automating driving can\nreduce the risk of human error, which is currently the main\ncause of car accidents, he said.  Auto insurance will have \u201cmore to do with information that\ncomes from the car than the classical segmentation with regard\nto characteristics of the driver,\u201d Renwick said.  Prior to Snapshot, Progressive was a pioneer in using\nmetrics such as credit scores to determine rates. The practice\nis now used widely in the industry. The auto insurer said in\nApril that the monitoring device had helped it log more than 6\nbillion miles (10 billion kilometers) of driving data.  State Regulation  In the U.S., the federal government oversees vehicle safety\nand each state regulates insurance and licenses motorists.\nInsurers and state authorities will have to decide how to assign\nliability and responsibility for an accident if a machine rather\nthan a person is driving.  Those impediments could delay adoption. Still, the pace of\nchange isn\u2019t keeping Progressive from thinking about\nopportunities, Renwick said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll just continue to refine estimates over time,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cBut along with those estimates, we\u2019ll also be starting\nto ask, \u2018What does an insurer look like in the future?\u2019\u201d  Progressive  climbed  0.2 percent to $27.12 at 10:54 a.m. in\n New York . The company has rallied 29 percent this year, beating\nthe 25 percent advance of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.
