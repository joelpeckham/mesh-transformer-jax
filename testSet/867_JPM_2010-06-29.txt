 "context": "The following article called 'U.A.E. Plans Shariah Money Market Entry After Law Change: Islamic Finance' was published on 2010-06-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe United Arab Emirates, the\nsecond-largest Gulf economy, may follow Malaysia, Bahrain and\nIndonesia in selling Islamic securities with maturities of less\nthan 12 months as legislators consider establishing a local debt\nmarket, according to Royal Capital PJSC.  \n Islamic bills would give Shariah-compliant banks more\ninvestment options, said  Ahmed Talhaoui , Abu Dhabi-based head of\ninvestment at Royal Capital, which is 44 percent-owned by United\nGulf Bank BSC, an investment bank in Bahrain. The U.A.E.\u2019s eight\nIslamic banks held $49.8 billion of deposits at the end of 2009,\nor about 19 percent of the total, central bank Governor  Sultan bin Nasser al-Suwaidi   said  at an Islamic banking conference in\nSingapore on June 14.  \n Banks that adhere to Shariah principles \u201care facing a\nmaturity mismatch,\u201d Talhaoui said in an interview yesterday.\n\u201cThey are keeping a lot of deposits but their options are\nlimited. Some banks are playing a dangerous game, which is\nessentially to match short-term liabilities with investments in\nsukuk,\u201d or Islamic bonds, which have longer maturities.  \n Malaysia, the world\u2019s biggest market for Islamic bonds,\nBahrain and Indonesia sell bills to help soak up cash in the\nfinancial system and set benchmarks for short-term bond sales.\nLawmakers in the U.A.E. are considering a proposal to establish\na government securities market by the end of the year, al-\nSuwaidi said in March.  \n \u201cShort-term liquidity management at Islamic banks and\nother financial institutions,\u201d is a challenge, al-Suwaidi said\nthis month in Singapore. \u201cThis is not a straightforward issue\nand has been under discussion between Islamic banks and the\ncentral bank. There is now a reasonable proposal to advance a\nsolution for this issue.\u201d  \n Difference in Yields  \n Saeed Abdullah Al-Hamiz , executive director of the banking\nsupervision department at the U.A.E. central bank, didn\u2019t\nimmediately return e-mails or phone calls to his office seeking\ncomment on the legislation. Governor al-Suwaidi said on March 15\nthat the legislation was in the final stages.  \n \u201cThe law will create a liquidity instrument that will\ncarry, not the guarantee of the central bank, but assurances\nthat the central bank will buy it for a certain price,\u201d al-\nSuwaidi said at that time.  \n Transactions in Islamic finance are based on the exchange\nof assets rather than interest to comply with Shariah\nprinciples. Global sales of sukuk fell 23 percent to $6.5\nbillion so far this year, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. Issuance totaled $20.2 billion last year, up from\n$14.1 billion in 2008.  \n Malaysia Bonds  \n The average gap between yields on Islamic bonds and the\nLondon interbank offered rate widened 2.4 basis points, or 0.024\npercentage point, yesterday to 433. The spread has narrowed 37\nbasis points so far this year, according to the  HSBC/NASDAQ\nDubai US Dollar Sukuk Index .  \n The  difference  between the average emerging-market yield\nand Libor narrowed four basis points yesterday to 583, based on\nthe EMBI+ index from JPMorgan Chase & Co. It shrank 52 basis\npoints so far this year, or 15 basis points more than the\naverage spread for sukuk.  \n The yield on Malaysia\u2019s 3.928 percent Islamic notes due\nJune 2015 rose one basis point today to 3.517 percent, according\nto prices from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  \n Bill Auctions  \n Malaysia\u2019s central bank sold 500 million ringgit ($155\nmillion) of 91-day Islamic bills at a weekly auction yesterday.\nThe  yield  on the securities rose four basis points to 2.68\npercent from last week. Malaysia began weekly auctions of\nIslamic central bank bills in 2006.  \n Bahrian\u2019s central bank sold 12 million dinars ($32 million)\nof three-month Islamic bills yesterday. The profit rate on the\nnotes rose to 0.88 percent from 0.85 percent at the previous\nsale on May 31.  \n The yield on Bahrain\u2019s 6.247 percent note due June 2014\nfell one basis point to 3.494 percent today, according to\nBloomberg bond trader composite prices. The yield reached a\nyear-low of 3.437 percent on June 22.  \n Pakistan plans to start issuing Islamic Treasury bills and\nwill announce an auction schedule before June 30,  Syed Wasimuddin , a central bank spokesman, said in an e-mail\nyesterday. The nation had 42.2 billion rupees ($494 million) of\noutstanding domestic sukuk as of April 30, less than 1 percent\nof its 4.6 trillion rupees of regular debt, according to data\nfrom the central bank.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to the industry,\u201d said  Harris Irfan ,\nhead of Islamic products at Barclays Capital in Dubai. \u201cRight\nnow we rely on using the London interbank offered rate as a\nbenchmark and that has its inherent criticisms. But what\nalternative is there? There is no Islamic Libor.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Haris Anwar  in Dubai at \n hanwar2@bloomberg.net ;\n Soraya Permatasari  in Kuala Lumpur at \n soraya@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 28.391572952270508 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
