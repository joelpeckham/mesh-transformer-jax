 "context": "The following article called 'Apple Cleared of Infringing Two Google Patents by ITC' was published on 2012-08-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc. (AAPL)  didn\u2019t infringe two patents owned by  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s Motorola Mobility unit for wireless technologies used throughout the electronics industry, a U.S. trade agency said yesterday in a decision that reduces the likelihood of an import ban on the iPhone.  The U.S. International Trade Commission didn\u2019t completely resolve the companies\u2019 dispute, ordering a trade judge to reconsider Motorola Mobility\u2019s claim that Apple violated another patent. The judge had previously found no violation of that patent, which applies to a sensor used to determine the proximity of a person\u2019s head to the phone so it doesn\u2019t accidentally hang up.  The commission could have stopped shipments of the iPhone and iPad at the border had it upheld Judge Thomas Pender\u2019s earlier finding that Apple infringed a patent for 3G technology. That determination had prompted criticism that the agency shouldn\u2019t ban imports of products that infringe patents related to technological standards used by an entire industry.  The sensor patent that\u2019s still in dispute is for a feature that isn\u2019t related to industrywide specifications and, thus, could be easier to work around.  \u201cMotorola was one of the earliest mobile phone innovators, and much of Apple\u2019s success builds on our foundational work,\u201d Christa Smith, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re considering our options as we continue to push for patent peace.\u201d  Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, didn\u2019t immediately return a message seeking comment.  Industry Standards  Motorola Mobility, which  Mountain View , California-based Google bought in May, contended in the case that Apple infringes four patents, including two that relate to industry standards for 3G wireless and Wi-Fi technologies.  The iPhone\u2019s $47 billion in  sales  and the $20.4 billion in iPad sales together made up more than 62 percent of Cupertino, California-based Apple\u2019s sales in fiscal 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  As part of its review, the commission said it would consider whether patents that are essential to following industrywide technology standards should be treated differently than other patents in cases at the ITC.  The trade commission released its decision shortly before a federal jury in  San Jose ,  California , ordered  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  to pay Apple more than $1 billion for infringing patents that cover features including pinch-to-zoom and copying the design of the iPhone. The jury cleared Apple of allegations that it infringed Samsung patents.  ITC Authority  The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, some members of Congress and  Intel Corp . have argued that the ITC shouldn\u2019t issue import bans on so-called standard-essential patents.  The notice posted on the International Trade Commission\u2019s website gave no indication where the agency stands on that issue. The full decision won\u2019t be made public until both sides get a chance to redact confidential information.  Google inherited the dispute when it spent $12.5 billion to buy Motorola Mobility. The company is counting on the handset maker\u2019s long history in the mobile phone space -- and its trove of 17,000 patents -- to force Apple into a settlement that could encompass other handset makers that use Google\u2019s Android operating system, including Samsung and  HTC Corp. (2498)   In  South Korea  yesterday, the Seoul Central District Court ruled that Apple and Samsung infringed each other\u2019s patents and told them both to stop selling some versions of their products in that country.
