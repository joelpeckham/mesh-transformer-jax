He said the previous administration \"weaponized\" the government shutdown in budget negotiations and did not encourage agencies to lessen the impact with unobligated funds.\nHe says, \"they chose to make it worse.\"\nMulvaney and Marc Short, the White House legislative director, spoke as the Republican-controlled Congress battled through budget negotiations in the shadow of a midnight deadline.

But, he added, \"we're planning for it as though it's 100 percent.\"\nAfter the House passed a four-week, government-wide spending bill, Senate Democrats vowed a filibuster unless there's a deal to protect certain young immigrants.\nAsked about a Plan B, Mulvaney noted talks over a shorter term deal, but said the House may be leaving which could create a funding lapse.\nStill, he said that he's open to that. He says: \"we'd like to keep the government open.\"\n8:25 a.m.\nPresident Donald Trump will not leave for a weekend at his Palm Beach estate unless a government shutdown is averted.\nThe White House said Friday that Trump will not head to Florida unless a funding bill passes.\nTrump was set to leave Friday afternoon and planned to celebrate the one-year anniversary of his inauguration at Mar-a-Lago.\nTrump tweeted Friday morning about the Friday night shutdown deadline, suggesting Democrats would be to blame.\n7:40 a.m.\nPresident Donald Trump says Senate Democrats are focused on \"illegal immigration and weak borders\" as a government shutdown looms.\nTrump says on Twitter Friday: \"Government Funding Bill past (sic) last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders.\"\nHe adds: \"Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!\"\nA divided Congress stared down a government shutdown Friday as Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked on immigration.\nAfter the House passed a four-week, government-wide spending bill, Senate Democrats vowed a filibuster unless there's a deal to protect around 700,000 immigrants from deportation who arrived in the U.S. as children and stayed illegally.\n1:08 a.m.\nA bitterly-divided Congress is hurtling toward a government shutdown this weekend in a partisan stare-down over demands by Democrats for a solution on politically fraught legislation to protect about 700,000 younger immigrants from being deported.\nDemocrats in the Senate have served notice they will filibuster a four-week, government-wide funding bill that passed the House Thursday evening, seeking to shape a subsequent measure but exposing themselves to charges they are responsible for a looming shutdown.\nRepublicans controlling the narrowly-divided chamber took up the fight, arguing that Democrats were holding the entire government hostage over demands to protect \"Dreamer\" immigrants brought to the country illegally as children.\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation was 14.050000190734863 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation was ",
