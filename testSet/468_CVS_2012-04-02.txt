The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. corporations are pointing to\nthe country\u2019s new status as the major economy with the highest\nstatutory corporate  tax rate  as a reason for overhauling the tax\ncode and cutting the rate.  Japan  reduced its rate, effective this month, putting that\ncountry\u2019s statutory tax rate at 38.01 percent, according to the\n Tax Foundation , a Washington group that favors a broader tax\nbase and lower rates. The U.S. rate, including state and local\nincome taxes, is 39.2 percent.  \u201cIn terms of forcing the idea of lowering the corporate\ntax rate as a vital part of U.S. economic strategy, we\u2019re\nencouraged,\u201d said James Pinkerton, co-chairman of a  coalition \nof companies that support lower rates, including  CVS Caremark\nCorp. (CVS)  and  Raytheon Co. (RTN)   Because of various tax breaks, the effective tax rate for\nmany U.S. companies is far below 35 percent, and many of the\nbreaks remain popular with companies and politicians.  U.S. lawmakers have been debating a corporate tax rate cut.\nLast week,  House Republicans  adopted a budget that called for\ndropping the federal rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. They\nhaven\u2019t specified how they would broaden the tax base.  President Barack Obama, in a corporate tax framework\nreleased in February, called for a 28 percent top rate and a 25\npercent rate for manufacturers. The administration suggested\ngetting rid of many tax breaks and changing the tax treatment of\ncorporate interest expenses.  \u201cWe\u2019re fully aware that there are tradeoffs involved in\nthis,\u201d Pinkerton said. \u201cAwareness is not the same as\nenactment.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nRichard Rubin in Washington at \n rrubin12@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJodi Schneider at \n jschneider50@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CVS Caremark Corporation was 36.086483001708984 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CVS Caremark Corporation was ",
