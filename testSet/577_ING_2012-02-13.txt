The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nItaly\u2019s technocratic government led\nby Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is generating more confidence in\ncredit markets than Spain\u2019s democratic administration as both\nnations struggle to overcome the debt crisis.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the cost of insuring Italian\nbonds with credit-default swaps tumbled about 200 basis points\nsince Monti took over from  Silvio Berlusconi  in November.\nSpanish swaps lagged behind, falling about 130 basis points\nafter Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  won office the same month.\nItalian contracts now exceed Spain\u2019s by 33 basis points, after\nbeing 141 basis points wider two months ago.  Monti has garnered praise from French President Nicolas Sarkozy for \u201cspectacular progress\u201d after pushing through\nspending cuts and tax increases to eliminate Italy\u2019s  budget\ndeficit  by 2013. Spain will struggle to reach this year\u2019s\ndeficit targets as Rajoy seeks to balance budget cuts as he\nfaces regional elections.  \u201cThe new Italian government is showing firmness in\nreaching the target of zero budget deficit for 2013,\u201d said\nAlessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV\nin Amsterdam. \u201cWe see more execution risk in Spain, which\nalready failed in 2011 with its deficit target.\u201d  The difference is also reflected in the nations\u2019 borrowing\ncosts, with Italy\u2019s 10-year bond yield tumbling almost 2\npercentage points since November to 5.6 percent, while Spain\u2019s\nbenchmark has dropped about 1.8 percentage points to 5.3\npercent. Italian yields now exceeded Spain\u2019s by 30 basis points,\ndown from 202 basis points at the end of last year.  The market may be signaling a downgrade for Spain, which is\nrated one level above Italy by Moody\u2019s Investors Service,\naccording to Giansanti.
