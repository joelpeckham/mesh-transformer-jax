The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ,  Germany \u2019s\nlargest phone company, won permission to offer speedier Web\naccess in most urban areas on existing copper lines, giving it a\ncheaper way to take on cable providers.  The Bonn-based carrier may deny rivals access to its\nstreet-side cabinets -- a precondition for installing the so-\ncalled DSL vectoring technology -- under certain conditions,\nGermany\u2019s Federal Network Agency said today in an e-mailed draft\nruling. Such a move is allowed, for instance, in areas where\ncustomers can choose an alternative fixed-line network, the\nwatchdog said.  \u201cThe driving idea behind the decision is to allow\nvectoring for all market participants and thus drive forward the\nbroadband rollout,\u201d Jochen Homann, the agency\u2019s president, said\nin the statement. \u201cThe open access approach ensures that no\nmonopolies may arise in certain areas: neither for Deutsche\nTelekom nor its competitors.\u201d  Other DSL providers may also use the technology if they\nagree to let peers offer their own data services via the cable,\nthe network agency said.  Shares of Deutsche Telekom rose 0.4 percent to 8.46 euros\nat 11:04 a.m. Frankfurt time.  Deutsche Telekom aims to supply 24 million German\nhouseholds with vectored DSL, which speeds up data transfer by\neliminating electromagnetic interference between wires, by 2016.\nThat would let it delay having to replace millions of copper\ncables in customer homes with fiber-optics connections in coming\nyears, slashing the cost of its broadband rollout by about 80\npercent per line, JPMorgan Chase & Co. has estimated.  Germany\u2019s former phone monopoly has estimated that covering\nthe entire country with fiber connections would cost 60 billion\neuros ($78 billion) to 80 billion euros. The company budgets\nless than 10 billion euros a year for network investments, a\nfigure that includes mobile and international networks.
