 "context": "The following article called 'Australia Must Find \u2018Significant Savings\u2019 in Budget, Treasurer Swan Says' was published on 2012-03-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAustralia  needs to find\n\u201csignificant savings\u201d in the budget to be presented in May, as\nthe government remains determined to return to surplus in the\nnext fiscal year, Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said.  \u201cOne of the lingering effects of the global financial\ncrisis has been a massive writedown of tax receipts,\u201d Swan\nwrote in his weekly e-mailed economic note yesterday. \u201cThis\nwill inevitably flow through to the budget bottom line and\nobviously means we will have to find significant savings in the\nMay budget.\u201d  Business profits unexpectedly dropped in the three months\nthrough December, by the most in two-and-a-half years as\nearnings weakened at mining and financial companies. Australia\nposted its first trade deficit in 11 months in January, as\nweaker shipments of  iron ore  and coal contributed to the biggest\ndrop in total exports in almost three years.  Under the Treasury\u2019s midyear review released in November,\ngovernment revenues were down A$140 billion ($148 billion) in\nthe five years to 2012-13 from the pre-crisis forecast, Swan\nwrote today. There has been further weakness in company tax\nreceipts since then, according to the Treasurer. The country\u2019s\nterms of trade are also expected to gradually decline in the\nyears ahead, as global commodity production increases, he said.  \u2018A Solid Result\u2019  Australia\u2019s economic growth slowed to 0.4 percent in the\nfourth quarter from the previous three-month period, according\nto figures released on March 7. The median estimate of\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for  gross domestic\nproduct  to expand by 0.8 percent.  The fourth quarter number was \u201ca solid result\u201d given the\nEuropean debt crisis, Swan said yesterday. Returning the budget\nto surplus remains the right strategy for the economy, he said.  \u201cMaintaining our fiscal rigor is absolutely essential at a\ntime when markets are punishing those without discipline,\u201d Swan\nsaid. It \u201cprovides the  Reserve Bank  with maximum flexibility to\nrespond to any further deterioration in the global economy.\u201d  The  Reserve Bank of Australia  left its benchmark  interest\nrate  unchanged at 4.25 percent on March 6 and reiterated that it\nhas scope to lower borrowing costs if demand weakens\n\u201cmaterially.\u201d The central bank, which implemented two quarter-\npercentage-point rate reductions in the final months of 2011,\nsaid that monetary policy was \u201cappropriate for the moment.\u201d  Traders are betting that the central bank will lower its\npolicy rate, with a Credit Suisse  index  based on swaps\nindicating that the cash target will be cut by 53 basis points,\nor 0.53 percentage point, over the next 12 months.  Mining Tax  The South Pacific nation\u2019s economic growth has been fueled\nby a once-in-a-century mining bonanza as the expansion of  China \nand other emerging economies boosts demand for resources such as\niron ore and coal. The boom conditions for Australia\u2019s miners\nhave hampered some other businesses as the nation\u2019s currency has\nsurged in value, weighing on the competitiveness of the\nmanufacturing and tourism industries.  The Australian government is aiming to implement a new\nmining tax and Swan urged independent and minor party lawmakers\nto support the measure as parliament resumes this week. The\nMinerals Resource Rent Tax will \u201chelp spread the benefits of\nthe mining boom to every corner of our economy,\u201d Swan wrote\nyesterday.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  and other iron-ore\nand coal producers, which negotiated the levy with the\ngovernment, face paying about A$11 billion in extra charges in\nthe first three years of the tax.  Swan, who is also Australia\u2019s deputy prime minister and has\nbeen treasurer since 2007, will deliver the government\u2019s budget\non May 8 for the fiscal year starting July 1.
