The president hasn't made a final decision to pick Lew,  we're told , but the president's staff has been instructed to prepare for his nomination. Among Lew's  many jobs  over the years, he was managing director and chief operating officer of Citigroup Global Wealth Management from 2006 to 2008. He  held the same titles  at Citigroup Alternative Investments from 2008 until early 2009, when he joined the Obama administration as\u00a0 director  of the Office of Management and Budget. As White House chief of staff, Lew succeeded another too-big-to-fail banker, William Daley, formerly of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Which leads to this question: Of all the people Obama could pick for Treasury secretary, couldn't he find someone who wasn't an executive at a systemically risky financial institution that took a taxpayer bailout from the Treasury Department?
