 "context": "The following article called 'Co-Op Bank to Trade Shares in London as It Raises Capital' was published on 2013-06-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Co-Operative Bank Plc, the U.K.\nlender that abandoned a bid to buy branches from  Lloyds Banking\nGroup Plc (LLOY) , will swap some debt for equity and trade on the\nLondon Stock Exchange to plug a capital hole.  Co-Op Bank plans to raise 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion)\nin capital by asking existing bondholders to exchange\nsubordinated debt for new equity and senior debt, with 500\nmillion pounds more raised through the sale of insurance assets,\nthe Manchester, England-based company said in a statement today.  \u201cInvestors in the bank\u2019s subordinated capital securities\nare also being asked to support the bank at this crucial time by\nparticipating in a wider exchange offer,\u201d said Euan Sutherland,\nchief executive officer of the bank\u2019s parent entity, Co-Operative Group. \u201cThis solution, under which they will own a\nsignificant minority stake in the bank, will then allow them to\nshare in the upside of the transformation of the bank.\u201d  The bank, which traces its roots to Britain\u2019s 19th-century\nindustrial north and has 4.7 million customers, last month was\ncut six steps to junk by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which cited\na capital shortfall. Co-Operative Bank\u2019s core Tier 1 capital\nratio under the latest round of Basel rules was 6.7 percent in\nJanuary, less than the 7 percent target set by U.K. regulators,\nMoody\u2019s said.  Capital Ratio  The bank\u2019s pro-forma fully loaded common equity Tier 1\ncapital ratio is expected to be above 9 percent by the end of\n2013, with the exchange offer taking place in October, Co-Op\nsaid.  Before the offer, the Co-Op Group\u2019s stake in the bank was\nwiped out, Richard Pennycook, the lender\u2019s finance director,\nsaid at a press conference in London today. \u201cEverything is\nnew,\u201d he said.  The lender had 1.57 billion pounds of core Tier 1 capital,\nafter regulatory deductions, for 2012, according to its  website .  Capital has been eroded by bad consumer and commercial real\nestate loans stemming from the bank\u2019s purchase of Britannia\nBuilding Society in 2009. Impairments more than quadrupled to\n468.7 million pounds in 2012, the company reported in March. The\nbank posted a pretax loss of 673.7 million pounds last year,\ncompared with a profit of 54.2 million pounds a year earlier.  Job Cuts?  While the lender will \u201cimprove the efficiency\u201d of its\noperations, it\u2019s too early to say whether that would mean job\nlosses, Sutherland said at the press conference.  The bank needs bondholders to agree to commit 1.05 billion\npounds of bonds to the deal out of 1.3 billion pounds of debt\noutstanding, said David Soanes, global head of financial\ninstitutions at UBS AG, at the press conference, who is advising\nthe bank.  The bank has 7,000 bond investors with 25,000 pounds of\nholdings or less, Soanes said. The bank will probably trade at\nleast 25 percent of its shares, he said, although the details\nhaven\u2019t been finalized.  \u201cThe balance of risk between shareholders and bondholders\nis being changed dramatically,\u201d said  Simon Adamson , an analyst\nat CreditSights Inc. \u201cThe question is how to persuade\nbondholders to take part. They\u2019re going to need quite a high\nacceptance rate. The question is, what is the incentive?\u201d  The Co-Operative Group, whose assets range from\nsupermarkets to funeral homes, has been replacing senior\nmanagement amid an abandoned bid for 632 branches owned by\nLloyds following concerns that its bank unit may not have\nsufficient capital to meet regulatory requests. The group last\nmonth named former HSBC Holdings Plc banker Niall Booker as the\nlender\u2019s CEO after Barry Tootell quit.  Customer Ownership  Booker said today the firm had considered many ways of\nraising the money while also retaining control of the bank,\nincluding having voting and non-voting shares.  The customer-ownership or \u201cmutuality aspect is protected\nby the majority ownership,\u201d Booker said. The listing doesn\u2019t\nindicate an intention to sell the lender, Sutherland said.  The company\u2019s 60 million pounds of 9.25 percent undated\npreference shares were quoted at 65 pence on the pound on the\n London  Stock Exchange. The bank said it won\u2019t pay interest on\nthe preference shares due on July 31 unless regulators give it\npermission.  The lender said that \u201cuntil further notice\u201d it doesn\u2019t\nintend to pay coupons that it can elect to skip on other, more\nsenior, securities unless supervisors give it permission. Its\n200 million pounds of 5.555 percent undated junior subordinated\nbonds were quoted at 45.5 pence on the pound, according to\nBloomberg Composite prices. Its 275 million pounds of 9.25\npercent subordinated notes maturing in April 2021 were at 75\npence on the pound, Bloomberg prices show.  \u201cThe Prudential Regulation Authority\u2019s current assessment\nis the Co-operative Bank needs to generate an additional 1.5\nbillion pounds in common equity Tier 1 capital in order to\nabsorb potential losses over coming years,\u201d the PRA and Bank of\nEngland said in a joint statement today. \u201cWe will hold the Co-Operative to the delivery of its plans.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAmbereen Choudhury in London at \n achoudhury@bloomberg.net ;\nHoward Mustoe in London at \n hmustoe@bloomberg.net ;\nJohn Glover in London at \n johnglover@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nEdward Evans at \n eevans3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 11.42733383178711 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
