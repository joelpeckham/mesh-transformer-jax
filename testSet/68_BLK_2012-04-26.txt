 "context": "The following article called 'Hedge Fund Dreams Fuel Man Group Deal Talk at Record Low' was published on 2012-04-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFor asset managers seeking hedge\nfund-like returns on the cheap,  Man Group Plc (EMG)  is now offering\nthe biggest discount on record.  The world\u2019s largest publicly traded hedge-fund manager was\nvalued at 0.65 times net assets this week before takeover\nspeculation lifted Man Group\u2019s stock from its  lowest price  in\nmore than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The\nLondon-based company also had about $1.7 billion in cash, more\nthan any investment management firm in the industrialized world\nrelative to its market value, the data show.  While Man Group fell more than  60 percent  in the past year\nas the computers that run its $21 billion flagship strategy\n failed  to spot profitable trades and Europe\u2019s debt crisis caused\nclients to withdraw money, it may lure asset managers looking to\nexpand globally, Robeco said. Man Group, which has almost 40\npercent of assets outside Europe and the Americas, could give\n BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  or  Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN)  better access to the\n$1 trillion mutual fund markets of  Asia  and Japan, and a larger\nslice of hedge-fund pools that command higher fees, UBS AG said.  \u201cIt could easily be taken over at this moment in time,\u201d\nMark Glazener, head of equities at Robeco in Rotterdam, which\noversees about $200 billion and owns Man Group shares, said in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cThe products are reasonably attractive.\nThere is an attractive distribution network, which also has an\nemphasis on Japan and Asia, two of the most difficult markets\u201d\nfor asset managers to build out on their own, he said.  Barrels to Algorithms  Laura Humble, a spokeswoman at Man Group, declined to\ncomment on whether the company is open to a sale or has been\napproached about a takeover. Man Group was valued at 1.73\nbillion pounds ($2.8 billion) yesterday.  Lauren Trengrove, a spokeswoman at New York-based\nBlackRock, declined to comment on whether the world\u2019s largest\nasset manager is considering an acquisition of Man Group. Matt Walsh of  San Mateo , California-based Franklin Resources said the\nmanager of the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds doesn\u2019t\ncomment on takeover speculation.  Founded in 1783 as a  barrel maker  by the Thames River in\nLondon, Man Group now oversees more than $58 billion in assets\nacross three divisions: the AHL managed-futures business, the\nMulti-Manager unit, and GLG, the U.K. hedge-fund manager that it\nacquired in October 2010.  AHL, which relies on computer algorithms to bet on the\ndirection of everything from equity futures to commodities, is\nMan Group\u2019s biggest fund. After rising  every year  since at least\n1999 and posting a 27 percent gain in 2008 as stock markets\ncollapsed, the strategy has  declined  in two of the past three\nyears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Correlations  The fund, designed to have little correlation to equities,\ntumbled 17 percent in 2009 and dropped 6 percent last year, more\nthan the Newedge CTA Index of managed-futures strategies in each\nof those years.  \u201cTrading conditions have been tough,\u201d  Peter Clarke , Man\nGroup\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a statement in January.\n\u201c Investment performance  varied significantly across styles,\nwith market volatility and reduced market liquidity impacting\ntrading opportunities.\u201d  Concern  Europe \u2019s sovereign debt crisis would make it more\ndifficult for managers to find profitable investments also\ncaused clients to pull money out of Man Group\u2019s funds. The firm\nsaid  assets under management  fell 15 percent in the nine months\nended December as redemptions exceeded sales.  Investment losses and client withdrawals have constrained\nfee income, and Man Group is mired in the longest earnings slump\non record as  operating profit  declined in the past three fiscal\nyears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Coming Unstuck  Analysts have also been cutting their  profit estimates  for\n2012, the data show. This month, Moody\u2019s Investors Service put\nMan Group\u2019s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade,\nciting \u201ccontinued under-performance from key funds.\u201d  Man Group\u2019s stock slumped to an 11-year low this week,\nleaving the firm trading at a 35 percent discount to the value\nof its assets minus liabilities. That was less than any time\nsince at least 1998 and lower than the historical average of\nabout 4 times book value, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Man Group\u2019s 1.06 billion pounds in  cash  is now equal to\nabout 61 percent of its market value, the data show, or about\nsix times higher than the median for developed-market investment\nmanagers globally with more than $1 billion in value.  \u201cThe market price very much undervalues the business,\u201d\nsaid Ben Kelly, a special-situations analyst at Louis Capital\nMarkets in London. \u201cValuation has always seemed a potential\nsticking point, but not anymore.\u201d  Courting Mrs. Watanabe  Man Group gained as takeover speculation emerged. Arnaud Giblat, a London-based analyst at UBS, said in a report on April\n23 that Man Group could be attractive because of its sales and\ndistribution relationships in  Japan  and the rest of Asia, as\nwell as alternative strategies that have higher fees than\ntraditional mutual funds.  Today, shares of Man Group fell 1.5 percent to 93.75 pence.  Potential acquirers could profit from Man Group as\ninvestors look for higher returns in Japan, where almost 60\npercent of the nation\u2019s  1,483 trillion yen  ($18.2 trillion) in\nhousehold assets was held in currency and deposits, the nation\u2019s\nstocks have lost more than 70 percent of their value since 1989\nand 10-year  government bonds  yield less than 1 percent.  Man Group oversees more than $10 billion in assets in Japan\nand has relationships with three of the nation\u2019s five biggest\nbrokerages and four of its five largest banks, UBS said.  The company also charges AHL clients  3 percent a year  to\noversee their assets and takes 20 percent of investment gains,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fee Structure  That\u2019s higher than many other  hedge funds , which usually\ncharge investors a management fee of 2 percent and 20 percent of\nprofits. U.S. mutual funds invest in stocks charged an average\nof 0.8 percent in fees last year on an asset-weighted basis,\naccording to the  Investment Company Institute .  \u201cWe see significant scope for a U.S. or Canadian asset\nmanager to seek to capitalize on the opportunity to access a\ntop-tier distribution network,\u201d Giblat said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cFrom a corporate buyer\u2019s perspective, if they think\nAHL is a great product and working, it is not difficult to see\nthat it is undervalued.\u201d  Man Group\u2019s underperforming AHL strategy and client\nredemptions could still dissuade potential buyers as it faces\ncompetition from rivals including BlueCrest Capital Management\nand Winton Capital Management.  Peter Lenardos of  RBC Capital Markets  said the number of\nbuyers may also be limited as increased financial regulation\nprompts banks to sell asset management units to raise capital.  Relative Value  \u201cCheap assets are cheap for a reason,\u201d said Lenardos, an\nanalyst at RBC in  London . \u201cThey also can get cheaper.\u201d  By closing AHL to new investors and running the fund to\ngenerate cash, Man Group could still be worth about 150 pence a\nshare, a more than 50 percent premium to yesterday\u2019s price, UBS\nsaid. The company\u2019s cash could also lure buyers willing to take\non the risk, according to George Godber, who helps oversee $22\nbillion at Charles Stanley & Co.\u2019s Matterley division in London.  \u201cThey have a lot of cash, so if they don\u2019t do the\nrestructuring themselves, someone else will do it,\u201d he said.
