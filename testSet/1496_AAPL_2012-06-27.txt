 "context": "The following article called 'Sprint Starting LTE in July as It Chases Verizon, AT&T' was published on 2012-06-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-\nlargest U.S. wireless carrier, will introduce faster service\nbased on the LTE standard in five cities on July 15, in a bid to\ncatch larger peers  Verizon Wireless  and  AT&T Inc. (T)   Networks supporting LTE -- short for long-term evolution --\nwill open in Atlanta,  Dallas , Houston,  San Antonio  and  Kansas\nCity , with Baltimore soon to follow. The company is seeking to\nmake good on a promise to have six cities with LTE by mid-year.\nSprint already sells phones that work with the technology,\nthough users won\u2019t be able to take advantage of the faster\nspeeds until the networks come online.  Even after the move, Sprint remains well behind Verizon,\nwhich has LTE in 304 cities, and AT&T, which offers the\ntechnology in 41 cities. To compete, Sprint is spending $10\nbillion on network expansion and it\u2019s aiming to tempt users with\nan LTE version of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhone, expected later this year.  \u201cVerizon and AT&T have a head start in LTE, but hopefully\nwe will close the gap pretty soon,\u201d Sprint Chief Executive\nOfficer  Dan Hesse  said in an interview. \u201cWe will be pushing\nhard to get more markets launched as soon as we possibly can.\u201d  Sprint shares were unchanged in today\u2019s trading, closing at\n$3.13 in New York. The stock has risen 34 percent this year.  Network Vision  Sprint\u2019s two-year network expansion, known as Network\nVision, is increase expenses at a company that has already\nposted five consecutive years of losses. Adding to the financial\npressure is Sprint\u2019s four-year contract with Apple to sell $15.5\nbillion worth of iPhones. Sprint was the last of the three big\nU.S. carriers to get the device.  The burden of LTE upgrades and the cost of selling the\niPhone highlight the challenges Sprint faces in a market where\nit competes with rivals nearly twice its size. AT&T has 103.9\nmillion users and Verizon has 93 million, while Sprint has 56.1\nmillion.  Sprint has explored deals to add scale. In February it\nbroke off talks to acquire regional pay-as-you-go carrier\n MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS)  Hesse said the industry was tilted\nheavily toward two players and that a stronger third player\nwould have benefits.  \u201cThere is such a huge gap in size between No.2 and No.3\nbeing Sprint,\u201d said Hesse. \u201cConsumers and the market would be\nserved better by seeing more consolidation among the smaller\nplayers so they can have size and scale to compete more\neffectively with the emerging duopoly,\u201d he said.  Hesse says his top focus is on the two years of network\nupgrades and not on acquisitions.  \u201cFor us to undertake a merger it would have to be\ncompelling if we were to do it in 2012 or 2013,\u201d said Hesse.\n\u201cThe hurdle is higher right now because of the importance of\ndoing this project well,\u201d he said.
