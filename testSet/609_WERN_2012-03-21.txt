 "context": "The following article called 'Too Few Truck Drivers Means Swift\u2019s Profit in Expansion: Freight' was published on 2012-03-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTrucking companies are struggling\nto find qualified drivers even as the U.S. unemployment rate\nremains at the highest level in almost 30 years.  Driver turnover rose to 89 percent in the third quarter of\n2011, the highest since 2008 and the fourth consecutive quarter\nof increases, according to data from the American Trucking\nAssociations. That\u2019s mostly because new regulations and job\nprospects in other industries are creating a \u201cquality\nshortage\u201d of available workers, said Bob Costello, chief\neconomist for the Arlington, Virginia-based group.  The increase in turnover is troubling because as the\neconomic expansion continues to gain strength, trucking is \u201can\nindustry that has jobs and may not be able to fill them,\u201d said\nCharles Clowdis, managing director of transportation advisory\nservices at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,  Massachusetts . To\nattract and retain drivers, trucking companies will need to\noffer higher pay, which will probably necessitate rate\nincreases, he said.  Companies such as  Swift Transportation Co. (SWFT)  and  Celadon\nGroup Inc. (CGI)  may be able to outpace the higher costs with rate\nincreases that will improve profit, said John Larkin, an analyst\nin Baltimore at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. He maintains \u201cbuy\u201d\nrecommendations on these stocks.  The U.S. jobless rate remains elevated by historic\nstandards, at 8.3 percent in February, compared with less than 5\npercent before the 18-month recession that began in late 2007.\nEven so, difficulty in recruiting and retaining workers probably\nwill be the \u201cNo. 1\u201d issue affecting Swift and the industry,\nPresident Richard Stocking said at a March 15 conference hosted\nby JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Millions and Millions  \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a weird situation when you have millions and\nmillions of people out of work to have a driver shortage, but\nit\u2019s starting to present itself again,\u201d Stocking said.  Newfound stability in construction is partially to blame\nfor poaching candidates as hiring in this industry picks up,\nsaid Thom Albrecht, an analyst in Richmond, Virginia at BB&T\n Capital Markets . Construction work offers a \u201cbetter quality of\nlife,\u201d he said: Instead of spending several days on the road,\npeople can work the same number of hours, make a comparable\nsalary and go home every night.  Worker mobility between these industries caused many people\nto take trucking jobs during the recession, Clowdis said. Those\nwho obtain a commercial driver license often get one that\u2019s\n\u201call-encompassing,\u201d qualifying them to drive both a dump\ntruck, for example, and an 18-wheeler, he said.  Construction Jobs  The number of people working in construction grew 1.2\npercent in February to 5.6 million from a year earlier, the\nsixth consecutive month of gains, Bureau of Labor Statistics\ndata show. The economy has added about 65,000 jobs in this\nindustry in the past year, though it\u2019s shed more than 2.1\nmillion since peaking in April 2006.  New regulations  intended to increase truck safety also are\naffecting hiring, Larkin said. Some of these rules -- from the\nDepartment of Transportation\u2019s Federal Motor Carrier Safety\nAdministration -- were implemented in 2010. More are on the way\nnext year, which \u201cwill further reduce the effective workforce,\nas well as hamper productivity,\u201d he said.  Safety records are now posted online for infractions that\ninclude speeding tickets, moving violations and improper load\nsecurement, Larkin said. The resulting shrinkage in available\ndrivers has cost the industry as much as 3 percent of capacity.\nForthcoming changes include further limits on the number of\nhours that drivers can work and requiring on-board trip\nrecorders.  Potential Drag?  This is tightening the supply of available drivers for such\ncompanies as  Werner Enterprises Inc. (WERN)  The Omaha, Nebraska-based\ncarrier anticipates finding drivers will be \u201ceven more\nchallenging\u201d this year than last, the company said in a Jan. 26\nstatement.  Similarly,  Arkansas Best Corp. (ABFS)  forecasts a \u201cpotential\ndrag,\u201d with more than 400,000 drivers possibly exiting the\nindustry by the end of 2014 due in large part to the regulatory\nchanges, Chief Financial Officer Michael Newcity said at a Feb.\n16 conference hosted by BB&T Capital Markets, citing FTR\nAssociates data.  Some people laid off during the downturn may be claiming\njobless benefits and supplementing this with \u201cunder the table\u201d\njobs instead of returning to work, Larkin said. The extension of\nunemployment insurance payments to as much as 99 weeks is one of\nthe \u201clarger competitors\u201d for Werner, President Derek Leathers\nsaid at a Nov. 16, 2011, conference hosted by Stephens Inc.  Raises and Bonuses  To combat this, companies are trying to make driving jobs\nmore attractive by offering pay increases, sign-on bonuses and\nother perks, Clowdis said.  Phoenix-based Swift will provide raises based on miles\ndriven, safety and service to customers, Stocking said.  Old\nDominion Freight Line Inc. (ODFL)  bumped up salaries by 3 percent in\nSeptember, Chief Financial Officer J. Wes Frye said on a Feb. 2\nconference call.  Higher wages probably will translate into increased rates\nfor customers, the trucking associations\u2019 Costello said. An\nindex of truckload revenue per mile rose 5.3 percent in December\nfrom the year earlier, to the highest level since July 2008,\nbased on a survey of the association\u2019s members.  Swift and Celadon should be able to raise rates faster than\nthe cost of inflation, Larkin said. Swift shares have risen 50\npercent this year and Celadon is up 38 percent, outperforming\nthe 12 percent rise in the  Russell 2000 Index. (RTY)   Growth-Free Expansion  Larkin projects rates will increase in the range of 2\npercent to 6 percent this year, which will help to drive margin\nexpansion, \u201ceven if economic growth remains mediocre.\u201d  U.S. gross domestic product climbed 1.7 percent last year,\ndata from the Commerce Department shows. It will expand 2.2\npercent this year, according to the median estimate of\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Still, if the economy were growing at a rate of about 3\npercent annually, \u201cwe would be struggling right now, but we\u2019re\nnot,\u201d Costello said. There\u2019s not yet a threat to the supply\nchain and higher wages may be helping with retention, he said.\nWithout wage gains, the situation would probably be worse, he\nadded.  Recruitment also isn\u2019t \u201cnearly as bad\u201d as in late 2005,\nwhen turnover peaked at 136 percent, Albrecht said, citing the\ntrucking association\u2019s index. Still, the current rate is more\nthan double the low of 39 percent in the first quarter of 2010.  Even so, the confluence of regulations and a rebound in the\nU.S. construction market is reducing the supply of qualified\napplicants, Clowdis said.  \u201cRight now there simply are not enough drivers coming into\nthe market to fill all the seats at many trucking firms,\u201d he\nsaid.
