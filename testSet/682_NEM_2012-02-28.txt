The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPeru\u2019s  economy  expanded at the\nslowest pace in two years in the fourth quarter as social unrest\nthreatened mining investment in the third-largest copper\nproducing nation.  Gross domestic product rose 5.5 percent from the same\nperiod a year earlier, taking full-year growth to 6.9 percent,\nthe government\u2019s statistics agency said today. Growth slowed\nfrom a revised 6.6 percent in the third quarter and 6.8 percent\nin the second quarter.  Private investment slowed as  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM)  halted\nwork on its Minas Conga copper and gold mine in November\nfollowing environmental protests. Though President  Ollanta Humala  supports the $4.8 billion project, investors doubt he\u2019ll\nresolve the dispute and prevent social tensions stalling other\nprojects, which is hurting business sentiment, said Pablo Secada, chief economist at the Peruvian Economy Institute.  \u201cThe only thing that could quicken growth in this global\nenvironment is far stronger private investment, and that depends\non confidence,\u201d Secada said in a phone interview from Lima.\n\u201cHumala is supporting Conga and other mining projects\npolitically, but there are doubts about his ability to\ndeliver.\u201d  Protests by local communities have also halted investments\nby Anglo American Plc and  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , the country\u2019s\nbiggest producer of the metal. Opponents to the expansion of\n Southern Copper \u2019s Toquepala mine rejected last week the\ncompany\u2019s offer to invest 690 million soles ($258 million) in\nhealth and water projects.  Plans to overhaul labor legislation and an indigenous\nconsultation law whose bylaws are being finalized by the\ngovernment also risk deterring investment, Secada said.  The government pumped up infrastructure spending in the\nfourth quarter as part of a $3.5 billion package to offset the\nimpact of slower global growth on the commodity-dependent\neconomy.  Household demand rose 6.4 percent in 2011, the fastest in\nthree years, fueled by rising income, record levels of  consumer\nconfidence  and employment growth of 5 percent, the central bank\nsaid in a Feb. 24  report .
