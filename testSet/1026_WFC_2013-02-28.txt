 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Auto Sales Seen as Best Since 2007 on Low Financing' was published on 2013-02-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNew car buyers, shunned by lenders\njust four years ago, now are benefiting from historically low\n interest rates  and more-available credit, pacing a U.S. auto\nmarket that is hovering near pre-recession levels.  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  AutoNation Inc. (AN) , respectively the\ntop-selling automaker and dealership group in the U.S., are\namong companies pointing to ample financing for new car and\ntruck purchases pushing sales comfortably past 15 million this\nyear, the highest since 2007.  \u201cWe have the best financing available for our customers\never,\u201d  Mike Jackson , the chief executive officer of  Fort\nLauderdale , Florida-based AutoNation, told a J.D. Power &\nAssociates conference this month in Orlando, Florida. \u201cI go\nback to \u201908 and \u201909, and I couldn\u2019t get the Lord Above\nfinanced.\u201d  U.S. light-vehicle sales probably climbed 3.7 percent in\nFebruary to 1.19 million, the average estimate of 10 analysts in\na Bloomberg survey. The annualized industry sales  rate , which is\nadjusted for seasonal trends, may have matched January\u2019s pace of\n15.3 million, the average of 15 analysts\u2019 estimates.  \u201cNo industry has benefited more from the unfreezing of the\ncredit markets than new and used vehicles,\u201d Tom Webb, chief\neconomist of Manheim Consulting, said this month in a report.\n\u201cAlthough the immediate goal of Federal Reserve actions was to\nlower long-term rates and support the mortgage market, it was\nauto-financing markets that enjoyed the first boosts.\u201d  Leasing Returns  GM, whose former finance unit needed a bailout because of\nlosses on subprime home mortgages, saw \u201ca number of lenders\u201d\ncompletely exit auto leasing during the recession, said Kurt McNeil, vice president of U.S. sales operations. The Detroit-\nbased automaker is now building General Motors Financial Co. and\nhas seen lenders including  Ally Financial  Inc., the former GM\nunit, and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , expand their offerings to its\ndealers and customers.  \u201cThe availability of  consumer credit  is plentiful,\u201d\nMcNeil said this month in an interview at a National Automobile\nDealers Association convention in Orlando. \u201cMore lenders are\ninterested in getting back into various elements of our\nbusiness. That just fuels opportunity.\u201d  The percentage of new-vehicle sales that were leases has\nexceeded 20 percent since the beginning of 2010 and has reached\nabout 25 percent the past three months,  Kevin Tynan , a senior\nanalyst at Bloomberg Industries, said in a Feb. 25 report.  Banks reported the most common rate for a 48-month new-car\nloan was  4.82 percent  in November, the most-recent reporting\nperiod. The rates have dropped from more than 7 percent before\nthe Fed lowered its target interest rate to zero in December\n2008 and began large-scale asset purchases to boost growth.  Ford Gaining  Ford Motor Co. (F)  probably boosted sales of its cars and light\ntrucks more than any major automaker in February, with an\nincrease of 9.8 percent, the average of 11 estimates. GM\nprobably sold 4.9 percent more vehicles than a year earlier, the\naverage of 11 estimates.  Deliveries of Ford\u2019s Explorer sport-utility vehicle will\nincrease more than 50 percent from a year earlier, Angie Kozleski, a spokeswoman for the Dearborn, Michigan-based\ncompany, said in an e-mail.  Rising demand is leading automakers to invest and add\nworkers at U.S. plants. Ford said this month it will spend $200\nmillion to boost production at an Ohio plant of a four-cylinder\nengine that goes into vehicles including the Explorer. The\nfactory will start production of the engine in late 2014 and add\n450 jobs.  Employment Rises  The number of people employed in motor-vehicle and parts\nmanufacturing climbed to 786,500 at the end of 2012, from\n653,400 three years earlier, according to the Labor Department.  \u201cCredit availability is a big part of supporting the\ngrowth of the  auto industry ,\u201d Joe Hinrichs, Ford\u2019s president of\nthe Americas, told reporters on Feb. 21 at the company\u2019s engine\nplant near  Cleveland . \u201cDealers are feeling more optimistic\nabout leasing and credit availability for consumers.\u201d  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  may post the second-biggest increase among\nthe largest automakers, with a 9.2 percent gain in combined\nsales for its Volkswagen and Audi brands, the average of four\nestimates.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  deliveries probably rose 8.5\npercent, the average of eight estimates.  Ally Financial, formerly known as GMAC Inc. and wholly\nowned by GM until 2006, probably will lose its lead this year\nfor financing the most new- and used-vehicle sales in the U.S.,\nBill Muir, the company\u2019s president and head of auto operations,\nsaid in an interview. Wells Fargo topped Ally in last year\u2019s\nthird quarter.  \u2018No Question\u2019  Banks are \u201cawash in deposits\u201d and putting them to use in\nlending to auto buyers with the best credit, said  Michael Carpenter , Ally\u2019s CEO.  \u201cThere\u2019s no question, for I think understandable reasons,\nthat the automotive market bounced back first,\u201d Carpenter said\nin an interview at the NADA convention. \u201cYou\u2019re not making a\nbet on a housing recovery and what\u2019s happening to  house prices .\nYou\u2019re making a bet on a loan over four years on a vehicle\u201d\nthat is \u201cindispensable\u201d to millions of Americans.  GM and Chrysler Group LLC are letting deals with Detroit-\nbased Ally expire this year that have guaranteed a minimum\npercentage of their vehicles sold with so-called subvented\nloans, those made to consumers at below-market rates. Chrysler\nthis month agreed to form a financing venture with  Banco\nSantander SA. (SAN)   Before settling on Santander, Chrysler received a \u201cnumber\nof proposals\u201d from financial companies that weren\u2019t interested\nin the automaker three or four years ago,  Reid Bigland ,\nChrysler\u2019s U.S. sales chief, said in an interview.  \u2018Very Attractive\u2019  Credit availability and low interest rates were \u201ctops on\nthe list\u201d of reasons why U.S. auto sales rose 13 percent last\nyear, the biggest annual increase since 1984, Bigland said at\nthe NADA convention. The  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company\nprobably boosted sales by 4.4 percent in February, the average\nof 11 estimates.  \u201cThe returns in the auto business over the last few years\nhave been very attractive,\u201d Trip Hall, president of Capital One\nAuto Finance, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s caused increasing\ncompetitive activity in the market, new entrants and players\nexpanding from where they have been in the past.\u201d  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  may have increased sales in February by 0.7\npercent and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  deliveries probably slipped 3.3\npercent, both the average of eight analysts\u2019 estimates.  Analysts estimate that Seoul-based  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and\n Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  may have combined to sell 5.1 percent fewer\nvehicles in February compared with a year earlier, the average\nof six estimates.  The following table shows estimates for car and light-truck\nsales in the U.S. Estimates for companies are a percentage\nchange from February 2012. Forecasts for the seasonally adjusted\nannualized rate, or SAAR, are in millions of light vehicles.  February had 24 selling days, one fewer than in 2012.
