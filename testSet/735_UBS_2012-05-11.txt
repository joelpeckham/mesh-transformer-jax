 "context": "The following article called 'Gold Bulls Weakest in Month as Investors Buy Dollar' was published on 2012-05-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGold traders are the least bullish in\nfive weeks after the metal erased almost all of this year\u2019s\ngains, as political turmoil in  Europe  and mounting optimism\nabout the U.S. economy drives investors to favor the dollar.  Fourteen of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices\nto gain next week and six were neutral, the lowest proportion\nsince April 6. Bullion futures slid to a four-month low of\n$1,572 an ounce today and  hedge funds  are making their smallest\nbet on a rally in about three years, Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission data show.  The Dollar Index, a measure against six major counterparts,\nrose for nine consecutive days through yesterday, the longest\nwinning streak since August 2008. Gold fell on seven of those\ndays, a sign that investors are favoring the currency over the\nmetal to protect their wealth amid concern that  Greece  may have\nto leave the euro. The  U.S. economy  will accelerate this quarter\nand in the following three months, according to the mean of 72\neconomists surveyed by Bloomberg.  \u201cWhen the market gets very nervous, then they buy dollars\nand gold finds it difficult to rally,\u201d said Jesper Dannesboe,\nan analyst at Societe Generale SA in London. \u201cGiven what\u2019s\ngoing on in the markets at the moment, any rally will probably\njust be a bounce before another setback.\u201d  Flight to Safety  Gold had risen as much as 14 percent to $1,792.70 by Feb.\n28 on the Comex in New York, before tumbling to $1,585 today.\nThis year\u2019s gain of 1.2 percent compares with a little changed\nStandard & Poor\u2019s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities and a 5.6 percent\nadvance in the MSCI All-Country World  Index (MXWD)  of equities.\nTreasuries returned 0.5 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index\nshows.  Bullion reached a record $1,923.70 in September. Prices\nslumped as the dollar became the \u201cflight-to-safety asset,\u201d\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a May 9 report. Barclays Plc\ncut its 2012 forecast by 8 percent to $1,716 yesterday because\nof political uncertainty in Europe and concern that  China \u2019s\neconomy will continue to slow.  Some investors may be retreating to cash after $3.01\ntrillion was wiped from the value of global equities since late\nMarch and commodities slumped to their lowest this year. Prices\nhave plunged before during gold\u2019s almost sixfold rally since the\nend of 2000. It slid to within about 1 percentage point of a\n bear market  on Dec. 29.  August Peak  Speculators held a net-long position of 116,061 U.S.\nfutures and options as of May 1, CFTC data show. While that\u2019s\n7.9 percent more than a week earlier, it\u2019s still 54 percent less\nthan the peak in August. They held 107,600 contracts on April\n24, the fewest since January 2009, the data show.  Open interest, or contracts outstanding, in U.S. futures\nrose 1.4 percent in the week ended May 8, as prices slipped 3.5\npercent, bourse data show. Rising open interest at a time of\ndeclining prices probably means traders added to bets on lower\nprices, Edel Tully, an analyst at UBS AG in  London , wrote in a\nreport yesterday. Open interest dropped 12 percent since the end\nof February and averaged 426,508 so far this year, 14 percent\nless than last year\u2019s average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  U.S. Mint  sold 230,500 ounces of gold coins in the\nfirst four months, 43 percent less than a year earlier, data on\nits website show. Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded\nproducts rose 1.1 percent to 2,382.7 metric tons this year,\nvalued at about $121.4 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Federal Reserve  Record-low  interest rates  from Europe to the U.S. may\nsustain demand for bullion, which generally earns investors\nreturns only through price gains. The  Federal Reserve  has\npledged rates at \u201cexceptionally low levels\u201d at least through\nlate 2014 and the  Bank of England  kept its benchmark rate at 0.5\npercent yesterday, where it has been since March 2009.  Europe\u2019s financial turmoil is reigniting on the second\nanniversary of policy makers\u2019 first attempt to curb Greece\u2019s\ndebt crisis. The country struggled to form a government after\nvoters swung behind anti-bailout parties. Fifty-seven percent of\ninvestors, analysts and traders who are Bloomberg subscribers\nsaid at least one country will abandon the euro by year-end, a\nsurvey published yesterday showed.  The  International Monetary Fund  forecast last month that\nthe 17-nation euro region would contract 0.3 percent this year\nas the U.S. expands 2.1 percent.  \u201cFinancial turmoil and easy money should see gold rally,\u201d\nsaid Adrian Day, the president of Adrian Day Asset Management in\nAnnapolis,  Maryland . \u201cOnce the liquidation phase is over, gold\ncould rebound smartly.\u201d  Indian Demand  Demand for physical gold in  India , last year\u2019s biggest\nbuyer, was almost double the daily average when gold traded\nclose to $1,580, Tully of UBS wrote in her note. India\u2019s\ngovernment said May 7 it withdrew an excise duty on precious\nmetals jewelry after jewelers closed stores in the longest-ever\nstrike through early April.  Volumes on the benchmark contract on the Shanghai Gold\nExchange doubled to 7,734.4 kilograms (7.73 tons) on May 9 from\nthe previous day and were the highest in almost two weeks.\nChina\u2019s gold imports from  Hong Kong  surged more than sixfold to\n135,529 kilograms in the first quarter, according to export data\nfrom the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong\ngovernment. China doesn\u2019t publish the country\u2019s gold trade data.  This week\u2019s decline took gold\u2019s 14-day relative-strength\nindex to 31.2. A level of 30 that indicates to some analysts who\nstudy trading charts that a rebound may be due. Goldman expects\nprices to advance to $1,840 in six months and $1,940 in 12\nmonths.  London Metal Exchange  In other commodities, 14 of 28 traders and analysts\nsurveyed by Bloomberg expect copper to climb next week and two\nwere neutral. The metal for delivery in three months, the London\nMetal Exchange\u2019s benchmark contract, rose 5.6 percent to\n$8,022.75 a ton this year.  Six of 14 people surveyed said raw sugar will decline next\nweek and three were neutral. The commodity dropped 12 percent to\n20.40 cents a pound since the start of January on ICE Futures\nU.S. in  New York .  Ten of 25 people surveyed anticipate higher corn prices\nnext week and six were neutral, while 11 of 26 said soybeans\nwill advance and six predicted little change. Corn slipped 9.6\npercent to $5.8475 a bushel this year as soybeans climbed 18\npercent to $14.245 a bushel.  \u201cUncertainties surrounding the future of Greece will\nnegatively impact commodity prices,\u201d said Bayram Dincer, an\nanalyst at LGT Capital Management in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland .\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect that current economic activity is very\ncommodity-price supportive.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nNicholas Larkin in London at \n nlarkin1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nClaudia Carpenter at \n ccarpenter2@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 7.835521697998047 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
