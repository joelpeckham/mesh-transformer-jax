 "context": "The following article called 'Santander Capital Pledge Stirs Debate as Bank Trails Peers' was published on 2013-03-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBanco Santander SA (SAN)  Chairman  Emilio Botin \u2019s pledge to boost capital has stirred the debate over the\nfinancial strength of  Spain \u2019s largest bank instead of ending it.  Santander would have a core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure\nof financial strength, of 8 percent at the end of this year if\nBasel III rules were fully imposed, Botin told the annual\ngeneral meeting on March 22. That\u2019s a lower ratio than all eight\nEuropean banks, such as  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Santander considers\nto be its peers when setting executive pay.  \u201cSantander\u2019s management has consistently held a more\noptimistic view of their core capital than most of the market,\u201d\nsaid Matthew Williams, a Paris-based analyst at Carmignac\nGestion, which manages Santander bonds and stock. \u201cWould we be\nhappy if they had 5 to 10 billion euros of additional capital?\nOf course we would.\u201d  The need to raise capital buffers has already forced\nSantander to sacrifice future earnings by selling profitable\nbusinesses such as a stake in a Mexican bank last year. It also\nsold its Colombian bank in 2011 for more than $1 billion in a\ndeal that followed sales of stakes in its Brazilian bank and its\nU.S. auto-loans business.  An official for Santander near  Madrid , who asked not to be\nidentified by name, declined to comment by telephone.  Selling Assets  Carlos Berastain, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Madrid,\nwrote in a report dated March 21 the bank may have already run\nout of options to bolster capital.  \u201cThey\u2019ve said they can get to 8 percent in 2013 and in the\nEuropean context that looks quite weak,\u201d said Benjie Creelan- Sandford, a London-based  analyst  at Macquarie Bank Ltd., with an\nunderperform rating. \u201cUp to now, they\u2019ve taken the approach of\nselling off assets to raise capital and perhaps they are running\nout of big ticket items that they can sell.\u201d  Santander closed at 5.24 euros in Madrid, up 0.2 percent on\nthe day. The shares have dropped 14 percent this year, giving\nthe company a market value of 55.2 billion euros.  Santander Chief Financial Officer Jose Antonio Alvarez has\nsignaled confidence in the capital position, saying in a\npresentation to analysts last week that the bank has a\n\u201ccomfortable\u201d position under Basel III rules.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is a theoretical number if Basel\nIII were fully implemented,\u201d said Carlos Joaquim Peixoto, an\nanalyst at  Banco BPI SA (BPI)  in Oporto,  Portugal , with a buy rating.\n\u201cI don\u2019t tend to think it\u2019s a major concern.\u201d  Capital Rules  The capital rules -- scheduled to be fully implemented\nglobally by 2019 -- will set the minimum core capital for banks\nat 4.5 percent of their assets, weighted for risk. So-called\nsystemically important banks must maintain capital ratios of\nbetween 8.5 percent and 10 percent.  Santander\u2019s estimate for a core capital ratio under Basel\nIII compares with more than 15 percent for  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , more\nthan 10 percent for HSBC and  BNP Paribas SA (BNP)  and more than 9\npercent for  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , Spain\u2019s second-\nbiggest bank, according to estimates for 2013 by Nomura Holdings\nInc.  Germany \u2019s Deutsche Bank is targeting a core Tier 1 ratio of\n8.5 percent by the end of this month.  The banks are all part of a comparison group of eight\nEuropean financial institutions used to set pay.  Deutsche Bank  \u201cBy saying your capital ratio is 8 percent under Basel\nIII, you are basically putting yourself on par with Deutsche,\u201d\nsaid  Simon Maughan , a financial strategist at Olivetree\nSecurities Ltd. in  London . \u201cIn terms of comparison, maybe\nthat\u2019s not really where you want to be.\u201d  The Spanish lender is trailing European competitors in\nraising capital buffers after the country\u2019s real estate collapse\nsparked an economic slump and pushed up loan losses. Santander\nallocated 18.8 billion euros to cover provisions and writedowns\nacross its whole business in 2012.  \u201cBasel III has wrongly shifted the priorities of banks to\nthe amount of capital they hold,\u201d said Cato Stonex, a partner\nat Taube Hodson Stonex Partners LLP in London, which holds\nSantander shares. \u201cIt\u2019s much more important for banks to focus\non the quality of assets.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nCharles Penty in Madrid at \n cpenty@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nFrank Connelly at \n fconnelly@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Banco Santander, S.A.
