The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEmerging-market stocks are\nexperiencing a \u201cBRIC breakout\u201d that\u2019s likely to have staying\npower throughout the year, according to Geoffrey Dennis, a\nCitigroup Inc. strategist.  MSCI Inc.\u2019s BRIC Index, tracking the shares of companies\nbased in  Brazil , Russia, India and China, rose 14 percent this\nmonth through yesterday after falling in eight of the previous\nnine months.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the BRIC gauge is beating\nMSCI\u2019s emerging-market index in January after trailing for all\nof 2010 and 2011. The back-to-back defeats were the first since\n2002. The chart depicts the ratio between the two indexes.  \u201cWe expect the BRIC outperformance to continue over the\ncourse of 2012,\u201d Dennis wrote two days ago in a report. He\ncited declining inflation and  interest rates  in developing\ncountries, money flows into emerging-market stock funds, and\nhistorically low share prices. The MSCI BRIC Index was valued\nyesterday at 9.4 times earnings, less than half its ratio two\nyears ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China  is the best choice among the four countries,\naccording to Dennis, who is based in  New York  and focuses on\nemerging markets. Stocks are poised to climb, in his view, as\nthe government seeks to bolster investor confidence and adds\nfunds to the financial system.  Brazil, Russia and India follow in that order, Dennis\nwrote. The Brazilian economy has to overcome relatively high\ninterest rates, the report said, while Russia faces political\nprotests and India\u2019s economic expansion may lack momentum.
