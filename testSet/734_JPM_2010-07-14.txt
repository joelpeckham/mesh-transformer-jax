 "context": "The following article called 'Putin Providing BP Investor Haven as Yields Tumble on TNK-BP Dollar Bonds' was published on 2010-07-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe worst oil spill in U.S. history\nis proving a bigger risk to debt investors than Russian Prime\nMinister  Vladimir Putin  as  BP Plc  bonds yield more than those of\nits Moscow-based affiliate TNK-BP.  \n BP\u2019s 5.25 percent dollar bonds due 2013 yield 117 basis\npoints, or 1.17 percentage point, more than the 7.25 percent\ndollar notes due the same year from TNK-BP, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s a turnaround from two months ago\nwhen TNK-BP debt yielded as much as 392 basis points more than\nBP.  \n Investors charged a 23 percentage point premium to buy TNK-\nBP notes at the end of 2008 as a battle for control between BP\nand its Russian billionaire partners led to employees being\ndenied work visas, an industrial espionage inquiry and the\nouster of then-Chief Executive Officer  Robert Dudley , who fled\nMoscow citing security concerns. Now it\u2019s London-based BP\u2019s\nbonds that have the higher yield as the cost for cleaning up the\nApril 20 spill in the Gulf of Mexico surpasses $3.5 billion.  \n \u201cThe risk of BP taking longer than planned to contain the\noil spill is far greater than that of TNK-BP being taken over by\nthe government,\u201d said  Sergey Dergachev , who helps oversee about\n$6 billion of emerging-market debt, including TNK-BP dollar\nbonds, at Union Investment in Frankfurt. \u201cThe latter would\nactually be credit-positive, essentially making TNK-BP quasi-\nsovereign.\u201d  \n BP\u2019s 2013 bonds have dropped as much as 20 percent since\nthe explosion on its Deep Water Horizon rig sent up to 60,000\nbarrels of crude a day gushing into waters off the coast of\nLouisiana. The U.S. administration forced BP to set $20 billion\naside to cover damage claims. The company has said it will seek\nto raise half that amount by selling assets, though it\u2019s ruled\nout selling its 50 percent stake in TNK-BP.  \n BP Rally  \n BP installed a new cap on the leaking Macondo well and\nplanned to start testing yesterday while continuing work on a\npermanent plug. The repairs helped lift BP shares 12 percent in\nthe past two days and the 2013 bonds gained 3.2 percent to trade\nat 98.78 cents on the dollar yesterday, down 10 percent from\nbefore the spill. TNK-BP\u2019s 2013 notes have fallen 2.9 percent in\nthe same period and traded yesterday at 106.35 cents.  \n Moody\u2019s Investors Service ranks BP at A2, its sixth highest\ninvestment-grade rating, and TNK-BP three levels lower at Baa2.  \n TNK-BP has generated more than $25 billion of net income\nand distributed over $20 billion in dividends since the tie-up\nbegan in 2003, Chief Executive Officer  Tony Hayward  said last\nyear. The U.K. company, under its former Chief Executive Officer\nJohn Browne, paid $7.7 billion in cash to Siberian oil producer\nTNK\u2019s shareholders, including  Viktor Vekselberg  and  Mikhail Fridman , to pool their assets and create TNK-BP under 50-50\nownership.  \n \u2018Holy of Holies\u2019  \n The transaction marked the last time a foreign shareholder\ngained more than 49 percent in a strategic natural-resources\nasset in Russia.  Royal Dutch Shell Group Plc  was forced to sell\ncontrol of its $22 billion Sakhalin-2 venture in 2006 to state-\nrun OAO Gazprom, ending regulatory threats to shutter the\nproject on environmental grounds.  \n Russia won\u2019t allow the European Union to interfere in the\ncountry\u2019s energy industry unless Russian companies such as\nMoscow-based Gazprom get greater access to EU markets, Putin\nsaid at the time.  \n \u201cIf our European partners are expecting us to let them in\nto the holy of holies of our economy, in this case we demand\nreciprocity,\u201d Putin said in May 2006, after meeting EU leaders\nin the Russian resort town of Sochi.  \n Spies Probe  \n Disagreements over expansion strategy and control in 2008\npitted BP against Vekselberg and Fridman, the country\u2019s third\nand 16th richest men according to Forbes. TNK-BP\u2019s offices were\nraided by Russian security services, foreign employees were\ndenied work permits and an employee with dual U.K.-Russian\ncitizenship was arrested and charged with industrial espionage\nas the conflict escalated. Former CEO Robert Dudley left Moscow\nin July 2008 and tried to run TNK-BP from outside the country\nbefore officially resigning in December five months later.  \n Hayward flew to Moscow last month to state BP\u2019s commitment\nto TNK-BP. Briefing reporters before meeting with Hayward,  Igor Sechin , Putin\u2019s deputy in charge of the energy industry, said\nthe executive may resign, according to a Sechin aide who\ndeclined to be identified because of government policy. BP\nspokeswoman  Sheila Williams  said later that day Hayward didn\u2019t\nplan to resign. Sechin is also chairman of OAO Rosneft, Russia\u2019s\nlargest oil company.  \n BP put Dudley, an American citizen, in charge of the day-\nto-day cleanup effort in the U.S. last month.  \n \u2018Out of Sync\u2019  \n Russia\u2019s government is \u201cmonitoring\u201d TNK-BP\u2019s work and\ndoesn\u2019t expect any change in ownership, said  Dmitry Peskov ,\nPutin\u2019s spokesman. BP\u2019s relationship with Putin\u2019s government is\n\u201ccooperative and constructive,\u201d  Andrew Gowers , a London-based\nspokesman for BP, said in a phone interview.  \n Russia may use BP\u2019s travails to push for changes in TNK-BP\nto conform with rules that cap foreign ownership at 49 percent\nfor \u201cstrategic industries,\u201d said  Chris Weafer , chief\nstrategist at UralSib Financial Corp., the Moscow bank and\nbrokerage controlled by billionaire  Nikolai Tsvetkov .  \n \u201cBP\u2019s 50 percent holding in TNK-BP is out of sync with the\nso-called rules of the game for foreign investment in Russia\u2019s\nstrategic industries,\u201d Weafer said.  \n Dollar Bonds  \n Russian government dollar bonds due in 2020 gained today,\npushing the yield down 8 basis points to 5.194 percent, the\nlowest since April. The extra yield investors demand to hold\nRussian debt rather than U.S. Treasuries fell 4 basis points to\n237, according to JPMorgan EMBI+ Indexes. That compares with 166\nfor debt of similarly rated Mexico and 213 for Brazil, which is\nranked two steps lower at Baa3 by Moody\u2019s.  \n The so-called  yield  spread on Russian bonds is 60 basis\npoints below the average for emerging markets, according to\nJPMorgan Indexes.  \n Credit-default swaps linked to Russian debt fell 11 basis\npoints to 169, near the lowest since May 18. The contracts,\nwhich investors use to hedge against losses on debt or speculate\non creditworthiness, pay the buyer face value if a borrower\nreneges on its obligations. Russia credit-default swaps cost the\nsame as contracts for Turkey, which is rated four levels lower\nat Ba2 by Moody\u2019s. That  difference  has narrowed from 40 basis\npoints on April 20.  \n Ruble Rises  \n The ruble gained 0.4 percent to 30.6000 per dollar in\nMoscow trading, its strongest close since May 18. Non-\ndeliverable forwards, or NDFs, which provide a guide to\nexpectations of currency movements as they allow foreign\ninvestors and companies to fix the exchange rate at a specific\nlevel in the future, show the ruble at 30.7350 per dollar in\nthree months.  \n The yield on ruble bonds sold by Gazprom, Russia\u2019s biggest\ncompany, is 201 basis points above the same-maturity Gazprom\ndebt in dollars, down from a yield difference of 600 a year ago,\ndata compiled by Bloomberg show. The spread narrowed to as\nlittle as 115 on June 11.  \n TNK-BP is BP\u2019s \u201ccrown jewel,\u201d accounting for more than a\nquarter of global  production  and providing steady dividends,\nsaid  Mikhail Galkin , head of fixed-income research at VTB\nCapital in Moscow.  \n In the event of a sale by BP \u201cit is logical to assume a\nRussian state company would be the buyer, which is definitely\nnot bad from the credit perspective,\u201d Galkin said. \u201cThe recent\nweakness in TNK-BP bonds is a good buying opportunity as the\ncompany is insulated from BPs woes.\u201d  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Stephen Bierman  in Moscow \n sbierman1@bloomberg.net ;\n Denis Maternovsky  in Moscow at \n dmaternovsky@bloomberg.net .  \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
