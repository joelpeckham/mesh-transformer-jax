 "context": "The following article called 'Consumer Comfort in U.S. Held Last Week Close to Five-Year High' was published on 2013-04-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nConsumer sentiment last week held\nclose to a five-year high as Americans gained confidence their\nfinancial situation was mending, a sign the biggest part of the\neconomy will keep expanding.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index fell to minus 29.9 in\nthe week ended April 21 from the prior period\u2019s minus 29.2 that\nwas the highest since January 2008. The decline was within the\nmargin of error of 3 percentage points. Households were the most\noptimistic about their  finances  in 10 months.  Confidence held up even in the face of the biggest weekly\n drop  in stock prices in five months, indicating that rising home\nvalues and easing  fuel costs  are helping to shore up balance\nsheets. The report may mean any slowdown in  consumer spending \nwill prove temporary just as other parts of the economy,\nincluding manufacturing, are cooling.  \u201cAmericans are feeling more secure about their own\nfinancial situation,\u201d said  Joseph Brusuelas , a senior economist\nat Bloomberg LP in New York. \u201cHousehold wealth is recovering.\nThe decline in gasoline prices is providing some relief to\nhouseholds across the income spectrum.\u201d  Of the three components of the comfort index, the personal\nfinances gauge climbed to 3.5 last week, the highest since June,\nfrom 1.6, the survey showed.  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index has risen 10.7 percent this\nyear through yesterday, helping repair the damage done by the\n2007-2009 recession. The gauge has surged 133 percent from a 12-\nyear low in 2009.  Fewer Claims  Fewer Americans than forecast filed claims for unemployment\ninsurance payments last week, pointing to an improving labor\nmarket, other figures showed today. Applications for jobless\nbenefits decreased by 16,000 to 339,000 in the week ended April\n20, the lowest since March 9, according to the Labor Department.  Economists projected 350,000 claims, according to the\nmedian estimate in a Bloomberg survey. A Labor Department\nspokesman said the claims data typically bounce around this time\nof year.  Stocks rose today as companies from Cliffs Natural\nResources Inc. to 3M Co. reported earnings that topped estimates\nand jobless claims fell. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index climbed\n0.3 percent to 1,583.97 at 9:40 a.m. in  New York .  The comfort survey\u2019s measure assessing Americans\u2019 views on\nthe current  state of the economy  dropped to minus 58.3 from a\nfive-year high of minus 54.7 the prior week.  Buying Climate  At the same time, the index of whether consumers consider\nit a good  time to buy  was minus 34.8, little changed from a\nfour-month high of minus 34.6 in the prior week.  Households continue to purchase automobiles. Cars and light\ntrucks  sold  at an average 15.3 million annualized rate in the\nfirst quarter, the most since the same period in 2008, according\nto data from Ward\u2019s Automotive Group.  One reason may be that  home equity  is being restored.  House\nprices  rose 7.1 percent in the year ended February, the biggest\n12-month gain since May 2006, data from the  Federal Housing\nFinance Agency  showed this week.  Housing-related businesses are among those counting on\nimproving home sales and consumer sentiment.  Benton Harbor ,\nMichigan-based  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR) , the world\u2019s largest appliance\nmaker, expects the industry will benefit from sustained demand.  \u201cAs we continue the year, we remain optimistic about the\ncontinued strength in U.S. housing and the consumers will gain\nconfidence as federal government policies become clearer,\u201d Marc\nBitzer, president of Whirlpool  North America , said on an\nearnings conference call on April 24.  Cheaper Gasoline  Cheaper fuel costs may also be helping. The price of\nregular gasoline at the pump averaged $3.51 on April 18, the\nlowest in more than two months. As recently as late February,\nthe average was $3.79.  The Bloomberg consumer comfort survey also showed Americans\nmaking more than $50,000 were the least pessimistic since\nNovember 2007. This measure climbed to minus 0.3 last week, from\nminus 3.3.  The mood of college graduates was the best in the past\nyear, with their comfort reading rising to minus 18.9 last week\nfrom minus 20.8.  Progress in the labor market, albeit slower in March than\nat the start of the year, may be helping underpin confidence.\nWhile employers last month added the fewest workers since June,\nthe  jobless rate  fell to a four-year low of 7.6 percent.  Confidence among consumers in the South was at the highest\nin the past year, and sentiment among independent voters last\nweek was just short of a five-year high reached in late\nFebruary, the comfort survey also showed.  Survey Methodology  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, compiled by Langer\nResearch Associates in New York, conducts telephone surveys with\na random sample of 1,000 consumers ages 18 and older. Each week,\n250 respondents are asked for their views on the  U.S. economy ,\npersonal finances and buying climate. The percentage of negative\nresponses is subtracted from the share of positive views and\ndivided by three. The most recent reading is based on the\naverage of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every\nparticipant in the survey had a positive response to all three\ncomponents, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative.
