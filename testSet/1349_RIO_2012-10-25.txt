The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAluminum stockpiles in the main\ntrading regions in  China  have climbed to the highest level in\ntwo years as growth in supply outpaces demand in the world\u2019s\nlargest user, according to two industry surveys.  Reserves in Shanghai, Wuxi and Hangzhou, and in  Guangdong\nprovince  gained to about 940,000 metric tons as of Oct. 22, the\nhighest since September 2010, according to Wen Junxiang, head of\nthe research department at Guangzhou KT Commodity Information &\nConsulting Co. Stockpiles more than doubled this year to about 1\nmillion tons, the largest since July 2010, said Zhang Chenguang,\nan analyst at data provider SMM Information & Technology Co.  The estimates add to signs of a glut in the second-largest\neconomy as new capacity, especially in the west, helps to boost\noutput to the highest ever even as China\u2019s  manufacturing  shrinks.\nAluminum in  London  has dropped 13 percent over the past year,\nand  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the largest U.S. producer, cut its forecast for\nglobal demand growth this month as  China\u2019s economy  slowed.  \u201cThere is no improvement in demand this October,\u201d SMM\u2019s\nZhang said in a phone interview on Oct. 23 in Shanghai. \u201cAs new\ncapacities continue to be installed in the west, we expect\ninventories to climb further.\u201d  Three-month metal on the London Metal Exchange, which\ntouched a 34-month low of $1,827.25 a ton in August, was little\nchanged at $1,939.25 at 5:47 p.m. in Shanghai. Barclays Plc said\naluminum\u2019s fundamentals \u201coffer the most bearish outlook for all\nthe base metals,\u201d according to an Oct. 22 report from analysts\n Gayle Berry , Sijin Cheng and Nicholas Snowdon.  Capacity Reductions  The increased inventories may force smelters around the\nworld to cut output further. Alcoa said in January it was\nreducing capacity 12 percent.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  said in November\nit would close the Lynemouth smelter in the U.K. The lightweight\nmetal is used to make autos and consumer appliances.  The survey results from both companies, which tally\nholdings in the three cities in the  Yangtze River Delta  as well\nas Guangdong province in the south, include metal monitored by\nthe Shanghai Futures Exchange. Those holdings have more than\ndoubled to 434,363 tons this year, the highest level since\nJanuary 2011, according to Oct. 19  data  from the bourse.  Aluminum stockpiles in China probably won\u2019t decline in the\nnext few months as demand \u201cisn\u2019t great,\u201d Yang Xiaowu, a senior\neconomist at  Aluminum Corp. of China , said in an interview on\nOct. 17. Inventories may be about 900,000 tons, he said.  LME Reserves  Reserves in LME-registered warehouses -- none of which is\nlocated in China -- have expanded 1.8 percent this year to 5.06\nmillion tons, according to data from the bourse, with 13 percent\nheld in  Asia . The  holdings  reached a record 5.13 million tons in\nFebruary. China accounted for 42 percent of global aluminum\ndemand last year, according to Bloomberg Industries research.  Output in China climbed 11 percent to 14.77 million tons in\nthe first nine months from a year ago, according to the National\nBureau of Statistics, while CRU International Ltd. forecast\ndemand growth may slow to 7.5 percent this year. Production in\nXinjiang, a western region, was a record 104,282 tons in August,\naccording to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. That\ncompares with 311,910 tons in Henan, the biggest producer.  The market balance shows an oversupply, both for this year\nas well as 2013 even as water, power sourcing and logistics may\nlead to slower-than-expected production growth in Xinjiang,\nBarclays said in the Oct. 22 report.  Manufacturing may have contracted for a 12th month in\nOctober, according to a preliminary reading of a purchasing\nmanagers\u2019 index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. The\ngauge stood at 49.1, below the level of 50 that separates\ncontraction from expansion. The  economy  grew 7.4 percent in the\nthird quarter, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2009.  \u2018Huge Stimulus\u2019  \u201cUnless there are huge stimulus policies coming after the\nparty congress in November, inventories will rise to a new\nrecord,\u201d said Wen at Guangzhou KT, a unit of KCTH Trading Co.\nThe all-time high is 1.2 million tons, set in May 2010.  The Communist Party is set to begin a congress Nov. 8, part\nof a once-a-decade power handover. The government won\u2019t provide\nlarge stimulus and a strong rebound in growth is unlikely, Song\nGuoqing, an adviser to the People\u2019s Bank of China, said Oct. 18.  Global aluminum demand will climb by 6 percent this year,\nNew York-based Alcoa said Oct. 9 in its third-quarter earnings\nstatement. It said in July that usage would rise 7 percent,\nafter increases of 10 percent in 2011 and 13 percent in 2010.
