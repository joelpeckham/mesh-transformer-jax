 "context": "The following article called 'Japan Pension Fund Becomes Net Bond Seller in Risk for Government Finances' was published on 2010-07-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapan\u2019s public pension fund sold\nmore government bonds than it bought for the first time in nine\nyears, underscoring concern that an aging population will make\ndomestic investors less able to finance state borrowings.  \n The fund sold a net 443.2 billion yen ($5 billion) of\nJapanese government bonds in the year ended March 31, according\nto Bank of Japan data released last month. It held 79.5\ntrillion yen of the securities at the fiscal year end, 11.6\npercent of the outstanding amount.  \n Households have funded Japan\u2019s  record debt  because much of\ntheir 1,400 trillion yen in financial assets is being used by\nbanks, pension funds and insurance companies to buy government\nbonds. More retirees will tap their pensions as the  population \ngets  older , a trend that the diminishing ranks of young people\nwill find difficult to offset, said economist  Junko Nishioka .  \n \u201cThe large domestic pool of savings, which has helped\nabsorb government bonds, is going to shrink,\u201d Nishioka said.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t affect bond yields in the near term, but it will\nbecome a huge problem in the long run.\u201d  \n Yields  on Japan\u2019s 10-year bond have held below 1.4 percent\nfor most of this year and were 1.125 percent at 3:55 p.m. in\nTokyo. The Nikkei newspaper reported the information on the\npension fund\u2019s bond sales earlier today.  \n Domestic Investors  \n Prime Minister Naoto Kan has been warning that Japan\u2019s\nfinances may collapse unless it reins in the world\u2019s biggest\npublic debt. His idea of an increase in the 5 percent sales tax\nto help pay for welfare costs for the elderly didn\u2019t resonate\nwith voters in a July 11 election, as his coalition lost its\nmajority in the upper house.  \n \u201cThe only way Japan can survive is to undertake fiscal\nrehabilitation at the same time as boosting economic growth,\u201d\nsaid  Masamichi Adachi , a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. in Tokyo. \u201cJapan should stop runaway budget deficits as\nearly as possible.\u201d  \n Even as it struggles to contain its liabilities, Japan has\nbenefited from low borrowing costs because about 94 percent of\nits bonds are held by domestic investors. The country may need\nto increase dependence on foreign buyers of its debt over time\nbecause of the graying population, according to Finance\nMinistry official  Masaaki Kaizuka .  \n \u201cWe may see the need to increase reliance from abroad,\nwhether we want to or not,\u201d Kaizuka, director of debt\nmanagement, said on May 12.  \n Dig Into Reserves  \n The rising number of retirees increases pension payouts,\nprompting funds to dig into reserves and leaving less leeway to\ninvest in government bonds, RBS\u2019s Nishioka said. Reserves for\nnational and employee pensions are estimated at 128 trillion\nyen as of March 2010, down from 141 trillion yen three years\nearlier, according to Finance Ministry data.  \n The retirement of baby boomers -- defined in Japan as\nthose born between 1947 and 1949 -- may strain the public\ncoffers as soon as 2012,  Toshihiro Nagahama , chief economist at\nDai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo, said in an interview\nin May. \u201cThat may be when Japan\u2019s sovereign risk becomes\nevident,\u201d he said.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Keiko Ujikane  in Tokyo at \n kujikane@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 28.909894943237305 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
