The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTreasuries fell, pushing 10-year\nnote yields close to two-week highs, as concern ebbed that\n Europe \u2019s leaders will fail to contain region\u2019s three-year debt\ncrisis, reducing haven demand.  U.S. 10-year yields rose the most on a weekly basis since\nSeptember as finance ministers from the euro area prepare to\nhold a meeting on Nov. 26 to discuss unlocking bailout funds for\n Greece , after failing to reach an agreement earlier this week.\nThe U.S. will sell $99 billion in notes next week.  \u201cWe are just going to stay range-bound, barring what goes\non in Europe,\u201d said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist\nat Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 21 primary dealers\nthat trade with the Fed.  The 10-year note yield rose one basis point, or 0.01\npercentage point, to 1.69 percent as of 1:59 p.m. in New York.\nThe price of the 1.625 percent security maturing in November\n2022 fell 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 of face value, to 99\n13/32, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  The yield rose earlier today to 1.70 percent, the  most \nsince Nov. 7. It rose 11 basis points this week, the most since\nSept. 14.  Trading of U.S. government bonds closed at 2 p.m. in New\nYork after it was shut yesterday for Thanksgiving.  Less Expense  Treasuries traded at the least expensive levels in more\nthan two weeks. The 10-year  term premium , a model created by\neconomists at the Fed that includes expectations for interest\nrates, growth and inflation, was negative 0.87 percent, the\nleast costly since Nov. 6. A negative reading indicates\ninvestors are willing to accept yields below what\u2019s considered\nfair value. The average this year is negative 0.76 percent.  Treasury trading volume dropped to $163 billion on Nov. 21,\ncompared with the 2012 daily average of $241 billion, according\nto ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government\ndebt. The figure was down from $242 billion the previous day.  The U.S. government is scheduled to auction $35 billion of\ntwo-year notes on Nov. 27. The Treasury will offer the same\namount of five-year securities on Nov. 28 and $29 billion of\nseven-year debt the following day.  Spain\u2019s Debt  Spain\u2019s government bonds trimmed a weekly advance after S&P\nsaid the economic risks for the nation\u2019s banks have increased\namid greater credit risk in lending to households, corporations\nand the public sector.  U.S. government securities returned investors 2.3 percent\nthis year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. The  MSCI\nWorld Index (MXWO)  of shares has risen 12 percent during the period,\nincluding reinvested dividends. Demand for the securities has\nbeen sustained as European leaders struggled to resolve the\nsovereign debt crisis and the U.S. approached the so-called\nfiscal cliff of automatic spending cuts and tax increases.  Greece is negotiating with euro-area politicians and the\nInternational Monetary Fund over the steps needed to qualify for\nthe release of loan installments frozen since June.  \u201cThe Treasury market will be dictated to by events in\nEurope, given the lack of data\u201d in the U.S. today, said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets\nLtd. in Edinburgh. \u201cWe have some more data next week. We have\nthe meeting on Greece and it looks increasingly likely that a\ncompromise will be cobbled together.\u201d  Durable Goods  The Commerce Department may say on Nov. 27 that bookings\nfor  goods  meant to last at least three years fell 0.8 percent in\nOctober from the prior month, according to the median projection\nof economist surveyed by Bloomberg.  The housing revival still faces \u201c significant obstacles ,\u201d\nand strengthening the housing recovery remains a \u201ccritical\nchallenge\u201d for policy makers, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said\non Nov. 15. He unveiled a plan in September to buy $40 billion\nof mortgage debt a month in a third round of so-called\nquantitative easing.  The Fed currently sells shorter-term notes and buys longer-\nmaturity bonds as part of its  Operation Twist  program due to\nexpire at the end of this year. The central bank will  buy  as\nmuch as $2.25 billion of Treasuries maturing in February 2036 to\nNovember 2042 on Nov. 26.  Fed\u2019s Role  \u201cYou\u2019ve still got fairly hefty buying by the Fed going\nthrough every month taking a whole lot of stock out of the\nmarket,\u201d said Michael Turner, a fixed-income strategist in\nSydney at Royal Bank of  Canada . \u201cSo, you can\u2019t be too\nbearish.\u201d  Gains by U.S. government debt securities may be limited\namid optimism that politicians will find a way to avoid the so-\ncalled fiscal cliff.  The 10-year yield has rebounded since it reached a two-\nmonth low of 1.55 percent on Nov. 16 when President  Barack Obama \nmet with congressional leaders about the fiscal cliff. House\nSpeaker John Boehner and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney\nboth described the discussions as \u201cconstructive.\u201d  The fiscal cliff refers to the $607 billion combination of\nautomatic spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to take\neffect in January. Lawmakers are trying to avert the cliff to\nprevent a short-term shock to the economy and reach an agreement\non long-term deficit reduction.
