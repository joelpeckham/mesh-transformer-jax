 "context": "The following article called 'Loeb Belief in Abenomics Drives Pursuit of a Sony Shakeup' was published on 2013-06-19. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nActivist  Daniel Loeb  took his team\nto  Japan  in April 2012 to determine if the world\u2019s third-largest\neconomy was ready for investment. The central bank had set a new\n1 percent inflation goal, an encouraging step in a country where\ngrowth had stagnated for two decades.  Yet Loeb wasn\u2019t convinced until October when polls signaled\nthat the next prime minister would be Shinzo Abe, a pro-business\nleader who agitated for reforms including a weaker currency and\nunprecedented monetary easing to end deflation.  As the economy blossomed in the first five months of 2013,\nthe stock market soared and the yen fell, Loeb decided the time\nwas right to push for a shakeup at  Sony Corp. (6758)  It reflected his\nconfidence that Abenomics had primed hidebound Japan for a\npolite version of American-style activism even at an iconic\ncompany.  A new Sony board will test that confidence after the\ncompany\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in  Tokyo  tomorrow. Three\nnew directors and a chairman will replace four outgoing members,\nincluding Welsh-born Chairman  Howard Stringer , 71. They will\nreconstitute the group that will tackle activist proposals by\nLoeb\u2019s Third Point LLC including an initial public offering of\nas much as 20 percent of Sony\u2019s entertainment assets.  \u201cSony has an opportunity to serve as a shining example of\nhow structural reforms, the \u2018Third Arrow\u2019 of Prime Minister\nAbe\u2019s economic plan, can be implemented successfully through\nconstructive shareholder engagement,\u201d Loeb wrote to Sony Chief\nExecutive Officer  Kazuo Hirai  on June 17.  Underlying Value  New York-based Third Point, which manages $13 billion,\ndisclosed that it had increased its stake to about 6.9 percent\nof Sony shares, which it valued at $1.4 billion, from the 6.3\npercent announced on May 14. Its stock has climbed 8.5 percent\nsince the plan first became public.  Loeb is urging the partial carve-out of Sony\u2019s music and\nfilm unit to unlock its underlying value and provide capital for\nmanagement to focus on turning around the consumer electronics\nbusiness. By creating an independent entertainment board,\nmanagers would be more accountable and would help in setting\ngrowth targets and allocating capital, Loeb wrote.  Sony\u2019s market value has fallen to about $21 billion from\nmore than $120 billion in 2000. While a weaker yen, job cuts and\nblockbuster movies like \u201cSkyfall\u201d have helped Hirai return\nSony to a profit after four years of losses, the company\u2019s\nsmartphones and flat-panel televisions are still being battered\nby competition from Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc.  Consecutive Losses  Sony\u2019s main TV business has lost a total of 762 billion yen\n($7.98 billion) from selling TVs in nine consecutive years of\nlosses. Without the contribution of the profitable entertainment\nunits and its insurance arm, Sony would have booked a 130\nbillion yen loss in the year ended March 31.  While Loeb\u2019s plan, coming after a deadline for shareholder\nproposals, isn\u2019t on the meeting agenda, Hirai has said directors\nwill study it closely. He has hired banks for advice, Morgan\nStanley and Citigroup Inc., a show of receptiveness that\ncontrasts with the routine rebuffs previous activist efforts\nhave elicited from Japanese corporate targets.  Loeb will have to overcome the skepticism of some close to\nSony that his proposals are the right way to unlock\nentertainment\u2019s value and tackle the ailing electronics\nbusiness, people familiar with the matter said. Sony had almost\n$8.6 billion in cash and undrawn credit as of March 31,\nand has issued four bonds since the start of 2012, suggesting\nselling part of a profitable unit to raise capital isn\u2019t\nnecessary.  He also needs to overcome Japan\u2019s traditional resistance to\nforeign influence.  Insular Culture  \u201cJapanese corporations have long been insular to this kind\nof restructuring and outside interference,\u201d said Michael Marks,\nthe former CEO of contract manufacturer  Flextronics\nInternational Ltd. (FLEX) , and a founding partner of investment firm\nRiverwood Capital LP, who has done business in Japan for about\n30 years. \u201cMy bet is on the no-big-changes side of the\nequation.\u201d  Loeb\u2019s optimism is rooted in part in his conviction that\nAbe will succeed in carrying out reforms to wrench Japan from\neconomic stagnation, said a person familiar with his thinking,\nwho asked not to be identified because the discussions weren\u2019t\npublic. He is encouraged by the people Abe\u2019s brought in to\ngovern, as well as the academics and officials he consulted\nduring five years in the political wilderness, the person said,\nincluding retired Yale University professor Koichi Hamada and\nKaetsu University\u2019s Yoichi Takahashi, a former Finance Ministry\nofficial who advocated a surge in Japan\u2019s monetary base.  Solidifying Control  After next month\u2019s upper house elections, when polls show\nAbe\u2019s  Liberal Democratic Party  is likely to solidify control of\nparliament, Loeb\u2019s camp expects him to use the next three and a\nhalf years to push his agenda beyond a weaker yen, said the\nperson. The hedge fund is looking for moves ranging from\ncorporate tax overhauls and aggressive deregulation, to\nincreasing women\u2019s participation in the workforce as Japan\u2019s\naging population retires.  So far, it\u2019s in monetary policy where Japan has made the\nbiggest break from the past. Before  Bank of Japan  Governor\n Haruhiko Kuroda  pledged to double the BOJ\u2019s monthly bond\npurchases and do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to end deflation, the\ncountry\u2019s central bank chiefs had stuck to policing bubbles\nrather than fostering growth.  Loeb has already won his first bet by shorting the yen\nstarting in October, a person familiar said. The currency fell\nby as much as 11 percent against the dollar as Kuroda unveiled\nin April the Bank of Japan\u2019s most aggressive quantitative easing\nyet.  Higher Confidence  Abenomics has boosted Japanese sentiment.  Consumer\nconfidence  last month climbed to the highest since 2007 and\nmajor companies plan to raise summer bonuses by the most in more\nthan 20 years, according to a survey by Keidanren, the country\u2019s\nbiggest business lobby.  For Sony, the weaker currency will make its exports cheaper\nand inflation and faster economic growth could revive a domestic\nmarket that makes up about a third of the electronic maker\u2019s\nsales.  While investors are skittish about whether Abe can deliver\non his promises -- the Nikkei 225 Stock Average has plunged 17\npercent in the last four weeks as the yen strengthened --\nJapan\u2019s market is up more than 25 percent this year, the most\namong developed markets.  \u201cWe\u2019re telling clients that the rally isn\u2019t over,\u201d said\n Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB\nInvestments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of $59.6 billion.\n\u201cThe economy and corporate earnings are improving and we have\nhigh hopes for Abe\u2019s administration.\u201d  Closer Look  Loeb\u2019s plan may get a closer look thanks to the presence of\nnew outsiders on Sony\u2019s board. Former Apple executives Eikoh Harada and Tim Schaaff are expected to be named directors at the\nshareholder meeting, as well as Joichi Ito, a director of the\nMedia Lab at  Massachusetts Institute of Technology .  \u201cThey\u2019ve been transparent with the use of outside advisers\nand I think it\u2019s actually a triumph of corporate governance,\u201d\nsaid Damian Thong, an analyst at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in\nTokyo.  To be sure, Loeb isn\u2019t the first U.S. hedge fund to take a\ncrack at Japan Inc. In the early 1990s U.S. investor  T. Boone Pickens  bought 26 percent of Koito Manufacturing and tried to\nobtain a board seat. The parts supplier to Toyota Motor Corp.\nspent a reported $4.4 million to thwart him and he dumped the\nshares.  Some activist investors are rooting for Loeb to succeed at\nSony, as it could open the door for them to go after other\nJapanese companies ripe for restructuring, said another\nactivist, who asked not to be named.  \u2018Binary Outcome\u2019  Abenomics presents investors with a \u201csort of a binary\noutcome,\u201d said Erik Davidson, deputy chief investment officer\nfor Wells Fargo Private Bank, which oversees about $170 billion.\n\u201cJapan could do really well, this could be the  turning point \nfor that country, or this could be the end game for Japan, sort\nof a last ditch effort.\u201d  Still, Davidson, who earlier lived and worked in the\ncountry for six years, returned from a Japan research trip in\nApril and liked what he saw, despite its shrinking population\nand other challenges. He raised his recommendation for Japanese\ninvestments to neutral from underweight.  \u201cJapan may finally, finally be at a turning point in their\nbattle against deflation, which has rewarded procrastination for\n15 years,\u201d he said. Today \u201cinvestors ignore Japan at their own\nperil.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nBeth Jinks in  New York  at \n bjinks1@bloomberg.net ;\nJason Clenfield in Tokyo at \n jclenfield@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJeffrey McCracken at \n jmccracken3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Flextronics International Ltd. was 7.650000095367432 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Flextronics International Ltd. was ",
