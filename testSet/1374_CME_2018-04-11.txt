The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApril 11, 2018 / 2:32 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago COLUMN-Copper goes from hero to zero for the money men: Andy Home Reuters Staff \n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters) \n* Bullish sentiment has evaporated rapidly \n* Chinese players could be leading the retreat \n* Comex copper and fund positioning: tmsnrt.rs/2qp4TGX \nBy Andy Home \nLONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - The record long holding amassed by fund managers on the CME\u2019s COMEX copper market last August is becoming an increasingly dim and distant memory. \nAt last August\u2019s peak of almost 125,000 contracts, their collective positioning exceeded anything seen previously, even during copper\u2019s boom years of 2009 and 2010, when prices hit 4.6255 cents/lb ($10,200 a tonne). \nSince the start of January, however, there has been a mass exit, net positioning collapsing to near neutral. \nThis peaking of bullish sentiment has also been mirrored on the London Metal Exchange (LME) and on the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) copper contracts. \nSo what has spooked the money men? \nGraphic on Comex copper price and fund positioning: \ntmsnrt.rs/2qp4TGX MASS RETREAT \nAs of last Friday fund managers were holding a net long position of 3,821 contracts on the CME copper contract. \nThe evaporation of bullish exuberance has been rapid. \nThough funds had already started reducing their positioning over the fourth quarter of 2017, collective length still amounted to almost 100,000 contracts at the end of the year. Prior to last year that would have been a record holding. \nThe reduction of speculative length has in no way hampered copper volumes on the New York exchange. \nFirst-quarter copper futures volumes surged 41 percent year on year, with options volumes jumping to 57,852 contracts from only 11,943. \nThe liquidity boom that accompanied the original build in speculative length is continuing. It\u2019s just that the bulls have turned bears, or at least a lot less bullish. \nA similar mass retreat has taken place in the London market , says LME broker Marex Spectron. \nIt calculates that speculative positioning amounted to 58 percent of open interest at the start of September 2017, the highest level since 2004. \nBy the start of January, funds had reduced their positions to 16 percent of open interest and are now \u201clargely neutral\u201d, Marex says. \nIn Shanghai, meanwhile, open interest on the ShFE copper contract surged to a three-year high in March as the price slid, suggesting a mass shorting of the market. A CHINESE SELL? \nChinese players could be leading this retreat from the copper market. \nThe step-change in activity on the CME copper market since 2016 has been attributed in part to speculative money flows seeping out of mainland China. \nIt\u2019s also noticeable that the implosion in speculative positioning took place not in December, the turn of the new year in the West, but in January and early February ahead of the Chinese Lunar new year. \nAnd since Chinese markets resumed trading at the start of March, \u201cChina appears reticent to drive our markets higher\u201d, to quote today\u2019s daily \u201cLME Morning Thoughts\u201d from Marex Spectron. \nThey are certainly not the only ones reducing long exposure to copper. \nGeopolitical risk seems to be ratcheting up daily and, with China and the United States raising the trade war stakes, investors are justifiably concerned about the impact on the world economy. \nThis has naturally weighed on industrial metals such as copper, which is heavily exposed to the health of global manufacturing. \nThat said, China seems to have turned collectively bearish on copper before the latest tensions. \nAnd when China turns bearish on copper, it\u2019s worth paying attention, since the country has been the driver of copper consumption growth for more than a decade. STOCKS BUILD \nSo far this year China\u2019s physical copper imports have held up pretty well. \nRefined metal imports were up 6 percent year on year in January-February and those of mined concentrates by 13 percent. \nTighter regulations have caused imports of copper scrap to drop by 40 percent, but that should translate into higher import demand for copper in other forms. \nYet that hasn\u2019t stopped a super-charged build in global exchange stocks of copper. \nVisible inventory often rises at the start of any year because of the Western and Chinese holidays and a seasonal weak spot for construction activity across the northern hemisphere. \nBut the first quarter\u2019s 348,000-tonne increase in inventories across the three global exchanges \u2014 LME, CME and ShFE \u2014 was the biggest in at least 15 years. \nAt a cumulative 889,000 tonnes at the end of March, exchange inventory was at its highest since 2003. \nThe biggest component of the first-quarter build took place in the LME warehouse network, where stocks rose by 182,375 tonnes. \nWhat\u2019s particularly noticeable is the end of the long-running bear-bull tussle that resulted in metal arriving in LME warehouses promptly disappear again in the direction of China. SIGNAL FAILURE \nInevitably, a stocks build of this magnitude is dampening bullish enthusiasm and weighing on outright price levels. \nAnd conspicuous by its absence this year has been any strong bull signal. \nThis year\u2019s proliferation of expiring labour contracts at key mines excited the market in the closing part of last year, but that excitement has been dialed back as several contracts \u2014 most significantly at the Los Pelambres mine in Chile \u2014 have been renegotiated without disruption. \nThe biggest potential flashpoint will be Escondida, the world\u2019s largest copper mine, which experienced a bitter 43-day walkout early last year. \nHowever, even here the mood music seems to be surprisingly peaceful, given the union\u2019s acceptance of management\u2019s offer to start early exploratory talks ahead of the July 31 deadline. \nLacking any obvious bullish entry signal, speculators are left mulling a bearish cocktail of high inventory, expected slowdown in China and potential escalation of a trade war between some of the world\u2019s most powerful nations. \nCopper\u2019s bull party could resume, therefore, but for now there\u2019s no good reason for it to do so. \nBut one thing copper bulls can cling to is the resilience of the metal\u2019s price to the mass exodus of the money men. \nThe unloading of hundreds of thousand of tonnes of long positions across the major exchanges has stalled but not reversed copper\u2019s rally from the early 2016 cycle trough. \nAnd what the money men take from the market, they can just as easily return.
