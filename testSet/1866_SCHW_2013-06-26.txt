 "context": "The following article called 'BofA, Citi Sued by University of California Over Libor' was published on 2013-06-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of America Corp.  and  Barclays\nPlc (BARC)  are among more than a dozen banks sued by the Regents of the\nUniversity of California over claims they manipulated the\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate.  The university system filed an antitrust complaint in\nfederal court in  San Francisco . It accuses the banks of fraud,\ndeceit and unjust enrichment, among other claims, and it seeks\nunspecified damages for either paying inflated interest rates or\nreceiving deflated interest rates on its Libor-linked\ninvestments.  \u201cThe defendant Libor banks in this case engaged in illegal\nand improper conduct and engaged in a criminal conspiracy that\ncaused harm to public entities and hundreds of millions of\npeople around the world,\u201d the University of California said in\nyesterday\u2019s complaint.  Global regulators have fined  UBS AG (UBSN) , Barclays and  Royal\nBank of Scotland Group Plc  about $2.5 billion in the past year\nfor distorting Libor and similar benchmarks. At least a dozen\nfirms remain under investigation around the world. This month,\nSingapore\u2019s monetary authority censured 20 banks for attempting\nto fix interest rate levels and ordered them to set aside as\nmuch as $9.6 billion.  Banks already face dozens of lawsuits by U.S. homeowners\nand other plaintiffs seeking to hold them responsible for\nalleged manipulation of the rate used as a borrowing-cost\nbenchmark. A class-action lawsuit filed in Manhattan in October\nby homeowners alleges a conspiracy among financial institutions\ndrove up the cost of  mortgage loans .  Dismissed Complaints  In April, a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed\nconsolidated antitrust complaints by plaintiffs alleging they\nwere harmed by the rigging of Libor. Bank of America and\nBarclays were among the defendants alleged to have conspired to\ndepress Libor by understating their borrowing costs, thereby\nlowering their interest expenses on products tied to the rates.  While potential damages were estimated to be in the\nbillions of dollars, U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald\nruled the cases must be dismissed because of the inability of\nlitigants that included brokerage  Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) , pension\nfunds and other bondholders to show they were harmed.  Eight California counties and public entities sued the\nbanks in January, alleging they lost millions of dollars because\nthey were cheated out of higher payments on investments such as\n interest-rate swaps  and corporate bonds tied to Libor. That\ncomplaint was filed by the same Burlingame, California-based law\nfirm, Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy LLP, that brought yesterday\u2019s\nsuit.  Key Metric  Libor is a key metric for setting  interest rates  for\ntrillions of dollars in financial instruments. It fixes the\nrates under which banks lend money to one another for as little\nas a day and as long as a year. Rates for 10 different\ncurrencies including the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and British\npound are computed daily after canvassing banks that comprise\nmembership panels for each type of money.  Michael O\u2019Looney, a spokesman for London-based Barclays,\ndeclined to comment on the lawsuit.  Bill Halldin , a spokesman\nfor Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, and\nDanielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based\n Citigroup Inc. (C) , another defendant, also declined to comment.  Representatives of two other defendants,  Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi  and Norinchukin Bank, had no immediate comment.  Peter King , a spokesman for the university system, didn\u2019t\nimmediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment after regular\nbusiness hours.  The case is Regents of the University of California v.  Bank\nof America Corp. (BAC) , 13-2921, U.S. District Court, Northern\nDistrict of California (San Francisco).
