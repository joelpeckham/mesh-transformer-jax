The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEfforts to make trading over-the-\ncounter derivatives safer may be compromised by delays and\ninconsistent national rulemaking, global regulators said in a\nreport today.  The Financial Stability Board said authorities may fail to\nmeet an end-of-the-year deadline for applying measures the Group\nof 20 nations agreed on in the wake of the 2008 collapse of\nLehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The plans focus on pushing OTC\nderivative trades through clearinghouses and onto regulated\nplatforms.  \u201cAlthough most authorities estimate that a significant\nproportion of interest rate derivatives will be centrally\ncleared by end-2012, they are less confident of progress for\nother assets classes and find it hard to make firm estimates,\u201d\nthe FSB said in a report on its website today.  Global regulators have sought tougher rules for OTC\nderivatives since the collapse of Lehman and the government\nrescue of  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , two of the largest\ntraders in credit-default swaps. The FSB also said earlier this\nweek that national regulators were failing to implement uniform\nmeasures to curb excessive bonuses at banks.  European Union and U.S. regulators have struggled to align\ntheir implementation of the international measures, with banks\nwarning that inconsistencies or overlapping rules may increase\ncosts and give foreign competitors an advantage.  Overseas Branches  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  are among\nU.S. firms to argue that applying the rules contained in the\nDodd-Frank Act to their overseas branches or units would\nthreaten their ability to compete.  \u201cMany jurisdictions have concerns about potential\ninconsistencies between national approaches to implementation of\nthe G-20 commitments,\u201d the FSB said.  Clearinghouses such as LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. and Deutsche\nBoerse AG\u2019s  Eurex Clearing  operate as central counterparties for\nevery buy and sell order executed by their members, who post\ncollateral, reducing the threat from a trader\u2019s default.  While rulemaking to implement the G-20 agreements in the\nEU, U.S. and  Japan  is \u201cwell underway,\u201d other nations have made\nless progress, the FSB said. \u201cAll jurisdictions and markets\nneed to aggressively push ahead.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nJim Brunsden in Brussels at \n jbrunsden@bloomberg.net ;  To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAnthony Aarons at   aaarons@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 26.509214401245117 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
