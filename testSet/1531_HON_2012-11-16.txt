(BA) \u2019s defense unit will shun\nthe commercial division\u2019s planned 737 Max aircraft and stick\nwith the current version of the narrow-body plane for its P-8A\nsubmarine hunters in order to avoid production disruptions.  \u201cThere\u2019s not a plan to offer a Max P-8A,\u201d Egan\nGreenstein, director of business development for the plane, said\nin an interview yesterday near  Seattle . \u201cBut we\u2019re not blind to\nthe fact that there will be opportunities that come out of it\nand we want to be able to offer those to our customers.\u201d  The P-8A is based on the existing 737 NG and built along\nthe same production lines, which churn out hundreds of the\nnarrow-body jets a year. The upgraded 737 Max, which is due to\nenter service in 2017, will feature new engines and other\nimprovements that will help airlines cut fuel costs.  The company has reached the \u201cfirm concept\u201d stage for the\nMax with the \u201cfirm configuration\u201d to follow next year, it said\nyesterday. The planemaker also said it will use larger cockpit\ndisplays, similar to those fitted in 787s, from  Rockwell Collins\nInc. (COL)  in the aircraft along with a new  Honeywell International\nInc. (HON)  air system.  While some minor changes to the  P-8  are possible, using Max\ndevelopments, the sub-hunter generally will be delivered as the\nNavy ordered it in 2004, said Chuck Dabundo, the P-8 program\nchief. For instance, while the Pentagon is getting 787-style\nscreens in the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker it ordered last\nyear, the P-8 will stick with older systems.  \u201cWe have a set of displays that the Navy is comfortable\nwith, and at this point there\u2019s no plan to change the cockpit,\u201d\nDabundo said.  Boeing unveiled the Max last year after Airbus SAS\nannounced similar changes to its competing narrow-body plane.\nThe Toulouse-based planemaker has won 1,515 orders for its\nA320neo, compared with the 969 Boeing has secured for the Max.  Shared Lines  The P-8 is the first military derivative of a Boeing\ncommercial plane to be built on the same production lines. The\naircraft was designed to be as similar to a commercial 737 as\npossible. That saves time and money from previous models that\nwere built and then torn apart to be militarized.  \u201cWhen we sold the P-8 to the Navy, the winning element was\ncommonality and cost,\u201d said Carl Lang, the P-8 program manager\non the Boeing Commercial Airplanes side.  Cost has become even more important as the Pentagon\nprepares to pare $487 billion from its budget over the next\ndecade. The reductions could more than double if automatic\nbudget cuts, known as sequestration, come into effect next year.  Future Production  Boeing has orders for 117 P-8s from the U.S. Navy and sees\nan international market for as many as 100, so it expects to be\nbuilding the plane until early next decade, Dabundo said. The\ncompany also has more than 2,000  orders  for the 737 NG in hand.\nIt\u2019s building a record 35 of the narrow-body planes a month, and\nis lifting the rate to 42 by 2014.  To ensure that the Max doesn\u2019t disrupt this increase, the\nnew plane will initially be built on a third line at the 737\nplant near Seattle. Early production will be slowed by the need\nto install extra instruments on the first four test planes.  Once the Max gets up to speed, the other two lines will\ntransition to that model, said Beverly Wyse, the 737 program\nmanager. The third line could then be used to boost production\neven higher, and the company already is asking suppliers to get\nready for that possibility, she said.  \u201cWe\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s coming,\u201d Wyse said of the\npossible additional increase in output. Then-Boeing Commercial\nAirplanes President  Jim Albaugh  said in May that the company\nplanned to decide by the end of this year or early 2013 whether\nto lift the 737 rate beyond 42 a month.
