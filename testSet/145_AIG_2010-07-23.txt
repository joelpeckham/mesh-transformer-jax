 "context": "The following article called 'Cuomo Reopens Probe of AIG's Cassano After U.S. Ends Its Case' was published on 2010-07-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNew York Attorney General  Andrew Cuomo  reopened his probe of former  American International Group\nInc.  executive  Joseph Cassano  after federal authorities closed\ntheirs, according to a person familiar with the matter.  \n Cuomo\u2019s office held meetings with Cassano\u2019s lawyers and AIG\nearlier this month, and are expected to meet again, the person\nsaid. Cassano, head of AIG\u2019s Financial Products unit until March\n2008, made derivative bets on subprime loans that forced AIG\ninto a U.S. bailout.  \n Cuomo shelved a 2008 investigation of Cassano after federal\nauthorities began probes. Now he wants to make an independent\nassessment of whether Cassano bears any civil liability for his\nAIG conduct, the person said.  \n The Wall Street Journal reported today that Cuomo had a\n\u201crenewed interest\u201d in Cassano, citing an unidentified person\nfamiliar with the matter.  \n The focus of the U.S. investigations was whether Cassano\nmisrepresented the value of AIG\u2019s portfolio of \u201csuper senior\u201d\ncredit-default swaps, which insured bond losses tied to the U.S.\nhousing market. AIG, once the world\u2019s largest insurer, received\na $182.3 billion bailout after these bets went bad.  \n In May, a person familiar with the Justice Department\ninvestigation said after a two-year probe, there was\ninsufficient evidence to charge Cassano. In June, Cassano\u2019s\nlawyers said the SEC also closed its Cassano investigation.  \n \u201cWe think they realized that our client acted in good\nfaith, kept his superiors informed, and was honest with\ninvestors,\u201d Cassano\u2019s lawyers, F.  Joseph Warin  and  Jim Walden ,\nof the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP said in a June 16\nstatement.  \n Warin had no immediate comment on the renewed Cuomo\ninvestigation.  Mark Herr , a spokesman for AIG, declined to\ncomment, as did  Richard Bamberger , a spokesman for Cuomo.  \n On June 30, Cassano defended the credit-default swaps\nblamed for the firm\u2019s losses, according to remarks submitted to\nthe Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Karen Freifeld  in New York at \n kfreifeld@bloomberg.net .  \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Andrew Cuomo, New York attorney general, talks to other attendees prior to a speech by U.S. President Barack Obama speaks about financial reform at Cooper Union in New York.
