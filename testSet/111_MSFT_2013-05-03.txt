(BLND) , the U.K.\u2019s second-\nlargest real estate investment trust, won approval to develop\noffices in a central London area that\u2019s the hub of the country\u2019s\nemerging high-tech industry, a person with knowledge of the\nmatter said.  The City of London Corp., which governs the business\ndistrict, will grant long-term leases to British Land for three\nsites with about 300,000 square feet (29,000 square meters) of\nspace, said the person, who asked not to be identified because\nthe talks are private. The London-based REIT will probably\nredevelop the 22 properties on the site, known as the Shoreditch\nEstate, into a large-scale office development, the person said.  British Land and the City of London Corp. didn\u2019t\nimmediately return calls for comment. Though the site is in the\nTower Hamlets borough, the City is responsible for granting\napproval because it owns the site.  The Shoreditch properties are mostly rented to technology\nand media companies and they are about half a mile from the U.K.\ngovernment\u2019s Tech City project, where Prime Minister David\nCameron has offered offices rent-free to small technology\ncompanies in a bid to create a rival to California\u2019s Silicon\nValley.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,  IBM Corp. (IBM)  and  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  have\noffices there, the government said in December.  The largest of the three sites has planning approval for\nmore than 150,000 square feet of offices. British Land and\nBlackstone Group LP\u2019s 4 million square foot Broadgate offices,\nwhich include the U.K. headquarters of  UBS AG (UBS) , are also nearby.
