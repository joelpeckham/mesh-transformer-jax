(PCG)  reached a $70 million\nsettlement with the city of San Bruno, California, over a 2010\npipeline explosion that killed eight people, the largest\nnatural-gas disaster in U.S. history.  The settlement will support efforts to recover from the\nblast, which destroyed 38 homes and damaged another 70, city\nspokesman Sam Singer said today in an e-mail.  The California Public Utility Commission said in January\nthat San Francisco-based PG&E\u2019s violations of state and federal\nsafety laws led to the explosion.  PG&E, owner of California\u2019s largest utility, confirmed the\nsettlement in a  regulatory filing , saying it will contribute $70\nmillion to a not-for-profit entity set up to benefit the city.\nThe company\u2019s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit won\u2019t seek to\nrecover the money through insurance or customer rates, PG&E\nsaid.  Recordkeeping Practices  Separately, state investigators found that PG&E\u2019s pipeline\nrecord-keeping practices leading up to the gas explosion didn\u2019t\nmeet the utility\u2019s legal and regulatory requirements for safety\nstandards, according to a report posted on the  California  Public\nUtilities Commission\u2019s website.  \u201cPG&E\u2019s recordkeeping was a mess and had been for years,\u201d\naccording to the report issued by the commission\u2019s consumer\nprotection and safety division. The utility\u2019s request to collect\n$222.8 million from customers to improve its record keeping\nsystem is \u201cexcessive\u201d, the report said.  \u201cPG&E has acknowledged the need to improve how we collect,\nstore, access, and share information about our natural gas\nsystem,\u201d said Nick Stavropoulos, executive vice president of\ngas operations at Pacific Gas and Electric, in an e-mailed\nstatement. The utility is converting its paper records to\nelectronic files and is asking for additional money for\ntechnology improvements to its system, Stavropoulos said in the\nstatement.  The commission staff analysis is part of an investigation\nby state regulators into PG&E\u2019s role in the Sept. 9, 2010 blast,\nwhich could result in fines. Federal and state fines could be as\nmuch as $1 billion,  Hugh Wynne , a New York-based utility analyst\nwith Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a Feb. 17 research\nnote.
