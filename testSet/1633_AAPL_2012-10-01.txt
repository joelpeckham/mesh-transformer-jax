The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nResearch In Motion Ltd. (RIMM) , the\nstruggling maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, would be more\nlikely to recover if it finds a strategic partner to help defray\nexpenses, Canadian billionaire Terry Matthews said.  \u201cPartnering is so important because it\u2019s not on your\nincome statement,\u201d Matthews, the founder of Newbridge Networks\nCorp., said in an interview today at the Toronto Board of Trade.\nAn alliance with another company could help RIM with research\nspending and generating revenue, he said. \u201cPartnering is an\nincredibly important part of the DNA of a company.\u201d  RIM Chief Executive Officer Thorsten Heins said last week\nthat he\u2019s met with CEOs at various organizations over the past\nseveral months to discuss software licensing and partnerships.\nThe Waterloo, Ontario-based company is trying to reinvigorate\ndemand for its BlackBerry phones after losing market share to\n Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhone and  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s Android.  RIM  climbed  4.8 percent to $7.86 at the close in  New York .\nThe gain, the shares\u2019 fifth in a row, cut their decline to\n46 percent this year.  Matthews declined to name any potential partners for RIM.\n Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , which like RIM counts companies as some of its\nbiggest customers, is often cited as the most logical partner.  \u201cMicrosoft is another issue,\u201d Matthews said when asked\nabout the potential for a tie-up between RIM and the Redmond-\nWashington-based software maker. The most important thing is a\ngood fit, he said.  \u2018Mutual Respect\u2019  \u201cThey have to have a good partner program and mutual\nrespect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could make a massive difference.\u201d  Among the 80 companies Matthews has started or backed are a\nhandful that make technology for large wireless operators,\nincluding  DragonWave Inc. (DRWI) ,  Mitel Networks Corp. (MITL)  and Bridgewater\nSystems Corp. He sold Newbridge Networks Corp. to Alcatel SA in\n2000 for about $7 billion.  Canadian technology companies struggle to get respect among\nU.S. investors, who tend to think of their North American\nneighbor in terms of commodity investing, Matthews said.  \u201cPeople don\u2019t actually value high-tech companies in  Canada \nbut they do in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201c Iron ore  is better, iron\nore, tin, zinc, lead, they love lead.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nHugo Miller in Toronto at \n hugomiller@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nNick Turner at \n nturner7@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was 20.51442527770996 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Apple Inc. was ",
