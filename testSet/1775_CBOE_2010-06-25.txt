 "context": "The following article called 'Fabrinet Raises $85 Million After Reducing Initial Offering Price by 29%' was published on 2010-06-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFabrinet , a maker of optical\ntelecommunications equipment, raised $85 million after reducing\nits initial public offering price by as much as 29 percent.  \n The manufacturer of laser components and sensors sold 8.5\nmillion shares at $10 each after offering them for $12 to $14,\naccording to Bloomberg data and a  filing  with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. The George Town, Cayman Islands-based\ncompany will use the proceeds to build a factory in Thailand and\nfund potential acquisitions.  \n The price cut came after six of seven U.S. companies sold\ninitial offerings within their forecast range during the past\ntwo weeks to help raise $1.5 billion. More than 30 IPOs\nworldwide were postponed or withdrawn since the start of May as\nthe European debt crisis sent the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\ndown as much as 14 percent from its 2010 high.  \n \u201cYou\u2019re going to have some rebirth of this market but it\u2019s\nnot going to be near anywhere near the numbers people have\nexpected,\u201d said  Michael Yoshikami , who oversees about $1\nbillion as chief investment strategist at YCMNet Advisors in\nWalnut Creek, California. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty selective in\nterms of the deals that do well.\u201d  \n Fabrinet will start trading today on the New York Stock\nExchange under the ticker FN. New York-based  Morgan Stanley  and\nDeutsche Bank AG of Frankfurt led the offering.  \n JDS Uniphase  \n Private-equity firm H&Q Asia Pacific sold 2.17 million\nshares to trim its stake in Fabrinet to 47 percent from 58\npercent, according to the SEC filing.  JDS Uniphase Corp. , the\nMilpitas, California-based maker of phone equipment, reduced its\nstake to 1.2 percent from 6.5 percent, and Shea Ventures LLC,\nthe venture-capital unit of Walnut, California-based J.F. Shea\nCo., cut its holding to 5.2 percent from 6.5 percent.  \n \u201cThere\u2019s a huge cash-out from the insiders,\u201d  Tom Samuels , who helps oversee about $120 million at Palantir\nCapital Management in Houston, said before the pricing of\nFabrinet\u2019s IPO. \u201cIt raises questions in people\u2019s minds. If they\nthink it\u2019s a fair price for their stock, why should I be willing\nto buy it from them at that price?\u201d  \n The U.S. IPO market showed signs of recovering last week as\ncompanies from  CBOE Holdings Inc.  of Chicago to Houston-based\nOasis Petroleum Inc. raised $1.15 billion. Hudson Pacific\nProperties Inc., a Los Angeles-based real estate investment\ntrust that invests in office properties, climbed  2.4 percent \nyesterday after selling $218 million of shares.  \n Tesla Motors Inc. , the Palo Alto, California-based maker of\nelectric sports cars, plans to raise $178 million in an IPO\nscheduled for June 28. Two people familiar with the plan said\nthis week that General Motors Co. of Detroit is preparing for an\ninitial offering that may sell 20 percent of the Treasury\u2019s\nstake in the automaker and reduce the U.S. to a minority owner.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Kristen Scholer  in New York at \n kscholer@bloomberg.net ;\n Inyoung Hwang  in New York at \n ihwang7@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of CBOE Holdings, Inc. was 29.20574378967285 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of CBOE Holdings, Inc. was ",
