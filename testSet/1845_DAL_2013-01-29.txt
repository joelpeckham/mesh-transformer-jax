 "context": "The following article called 'AMR Bondholder Group Said to Favor Merger With US Airways' was published on 2013-01-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA group of  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  bondholders\nwith about $1.5 billion in unsecured debt is backing a merger in\nbankruptcy with  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  and pushing for a deal by\nFeb. 15, people familiar with the matter said.  The bondholders coalesced behind the idea after reviewing\nconfidential data from AMR\u2019s  American Airlines  and US Airways,\nsaid the people, who asked not to be identified because the\ntalks are private. The promise of more cost savings and other\nfinancial benefits from a combined carrier than a stand-alone\nAmerican helped sway the group, one of the people said.  While the ad hoc group doesn\u2019t hold a seat on AMR\u2019s\nunsecured creditors committee, the debt holders\u2019 support gives\n US Airways  an ally as it makes the case for a tie-up that would\ncreate the world\u2019s largest airline. AMR said Jan. 3 it expected\nto decide in weeks to merge or stay independent.  Feb. 15 is the expiration date of non-disclosure agreements\nthe bondholders signed with the two airlines, one of the people\nsaid. Besides giving the debt owners access to proprietary\ninformation, the accords restrict them from trading in AMR or US\nAirways debt, two people said.  Gerard Uzzi, an attorney at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy\nLLP in New York who represents the bondholders, declined to\ncomment when asked about the ad hoc group\u2019s support of a merger.\nAn AMR spokesman,  Michael Trevino , also declined to comment, as\ndid  John McDonald , a US Airways spokesman.  Bondholder Group  Members of the ad hoc group include MatlinPatterson Capital\nManagement LP, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Cyrus Capital Partners LP,\nPentwater Capital Management LP and Marathon Asset Management\nLP, according to a Dec. 13 court filing.  Based on that filing, the group\u2019s holdings included more\nthan $880 million of unsecured AMR notes and more than $620\nmillion in unsecured trade claims, according to Kevin Starke, an\nanalyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The division of equity in a combined airline and who would\nrun it remain unresolved in talks among the carriers and AMR\ncreditors, the people said. The bondholders want the ownership\nof a combined airline to be settled first, with a decision to\nfollow on management, one person said.  AMR has urged that creditors get 80 percent of the equity\nversus 20 percent for US Airways shareholders, while US Airways\nfavors a 70 percent to 30 percent division, another person said.\nAmerican is the third-biggest U.S. airline, while US Airways is\nNo. 5.  Parker, Horton  US Airways Chief Executive Officer Doug Parker has pushed\nfor a merger since January 2012. AMR CEO  Tom Horton  agreed to\nconsider merger options in restructuring after saying the\nairline preferred to exit court protection and then weigh\nconsolidation.  Speculation that Parker would succeed has  more than tripled \nUS Airways shares since the day before AMR\u2019s Chapter 11 filing\non Nov. 28, 2011, topping the 26 percent gain for the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index. The stock fell 4.1 percent to $14.42 at the\nclose in New York as rising crude prices weighed on U.S. airline\nshares.  AMR\u2019s $460 million of 6.25 percent convertible notes due in\nOctober 2014 have soared more than fivefold during its time in\nbankruptcy. They rose 0.4 percent to 94.875 cents on the dollar\nat 10:10 a.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price\nreporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The ad hoc group began organizing in May to gain more\nleverage in AMR\u2019s bankruptcy, and later secured access to\nproprietary information as each of the carriers sought support.  The bondholders, some of which also own secured AMR debt,\ntold American pilots in November that their support for a stand-\nalone carrier after bankruptcy would be conditioned on the\nappointment of a new board. In August, the group said it was\ninterested in providing financing for an AMR restructuring.  US Airways has said combining the airlines could produce at\nleast $1.2 billion a year in savings and incremental revenue. A\nmerged carrier would surpass the top two by global traffic,\n United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and  Delta Air Lines Inc.
