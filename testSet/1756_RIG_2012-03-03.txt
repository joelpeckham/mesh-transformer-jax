 "context": "The following article called 'BP Gulf of Mexico Drilling Rig Explosion, Spill and Litigation: Timeline' was published on 2012-03-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBP Plc (BP) , which was set to got to\ntrial March 5 in federal court in New Orleans to determine the\nextent of liability for the April 2010 Gulf of Mexico  oil spill ,\nreached a settlement yesterday with lawyers for individuals and\nbusinesses hurt by the spill.  BP estimated the cost of the settlement at $7.8 billion.  The following is a timeline of the events leading to the\ndestruction of the  Deepwater Horizon  offshore rig, the\nsubsequent spill of millions of barrels of oil and resulting\nlitigation. All dates and events are from court, agency and\n securities filings , or company and government statements.  Jan. 30, 2010: The Deepwater Horizon moves onsite about 45\nmiles south of the  Louisiana  coastline to resume drilling the\nMacondo well after another rig withdrew due to storm damage.  April 1: ModuSpec USA Inc. begins a two-week condition\nassessment of the rig at the request of Transocean Ltd., which\noperates the Deepwater Horizon.  April 15: One of two BP well-site leaders assigned to the\nrig leaves to attend a conference on well-control techniques.\nHis replacement lacks any experience as a well-site leader on\nthe Deepwater Horizon, according to a U.S. Coast Guard\ninvestigation.  An employee of  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , designer of a cement job\nmeant to seal the well against leaks, advises his contact at BP\nby e-mail that 21 stabilizers are needed to center the drill\npipe in the well, according to court filings. The Halliburton\nengineer warns the well has a \u201csevere risk\u201d of natural gas\nleaks with only six of the devices, which could lead to an\nexplosive blowout, the court filings state. A BP well engineer\norders 15 additional centralizers flown out to the rig, which\nhas only six on hand.  April 16: A BP manager overrules the well engineer\u2019s\ndecision and orders the job to proceed with six centralizers,\naccording to court papers. BP operations engineer Brett Cocales\nsends an e-mail to the Macondo drilling engineer, Brian Morel,\nsaying six centralizers should be adequate to obtain a proper\ncement seal in the well.  \u201cWho cares, it\u2019s done, end of story, will probably be fine\nand we\u2019ll get a good cement job,\u201d he wrote, according to a copy\nof the e-mail cited in court papers.  April 18: Halliburton tests an innovative cement formula\nfor the well and doesn\u2019t provide all of the results to BP.\nHalliburton engineer Jesse Gagliano again advises BP the well is\nat risk for leaks if fewer than 21 centralizers are used,\naccording to court filings.  April 19: Drilling is completed to target depths. Casing is\ninstalled and cement pumped.  April 20: Drilling and completion operations are finished.\nThe well subsequently fails, resulting in blowout and explosion.  At 7:30 a.m. BP decides not to run a \u201ccement bond log,\u201d a\ntest that determines if the cement had properly sealed the sides\nof the well against leaks. In the afternoon, crews continue\nwell-completion tasks in preparation to move the rig to another\nlocation. About 5:30 p.m., engineers debate the results of\ncritical pressure test conducted to ensure the well isn\u2019t\nleaking. The test is ultimately declared successful.  In the evening, visiting company officials and rig\nsupervisors hold a \u201cleadership meeting\u201d which culminates with\nsome guests on the bridge of the rig, taking turns practicing\ncontrolling the Deepwater Horizon\u2019s positioning system in a\ntraining simulator.  At 9:41 p.m. drilling mud shoots out of the pipe connecting\nthe rig to the well on the seafloor. The first of two explosions\ncomes roughly nine minutes later, and the rig is quickly\nengulfed in flames. Workers, unable to contain the blowout or\nfight the fire, abandon the Deepwater Horizon. Eleven die.  April 22: BP and  Transocean (RIG)  are sued by the family of Shane\nRoshto, one of the 11 dead workers.  April 29: A Louisiana fishing charter boat operator sues on\nbehalf of the state\u2019s $2.6 billion industry, one of the first of\nthousands of litigants against companies involved in the rig\nproject, including states and the federal government.  May 6: The U.S.  Justice Department  asks the companies to\npreserve evidence, a signal that the government had begun an\ninvestigation into possible criminal acts.  May 10: A BP investor sues the company\u2019s directors claiming\nits alleged pursuit of profit at the expense of safety led to\nthe explosion and resulting spill, the first of many such suits.  May 13: Transocean asks a court to cap its liability at\n$26.7 million under a 150-year-old law designed to protect the\nshipping industry from catastrophic legal awards.  June 1: U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder formally opens a\ncriminal and civil investigation into the spill.  June 16: BP agrees to put about $20 billion into a fund to\npay damages resulting from the Gulf spill, with claims\nadministered by  Kenneth Feinberg , the lawyer who oversaw\nexecutive compensation for the government\u2019s financial bailout.\nLess than two months after the spill began, more than 225\nlawsuits in 11 states had been filed by businesses, individuals\nand investors over the disaster.  July 15: BP and the Coast Guard successfully cap the blown-\nout well, stopping a geyser of oil that gushed more than 4.1\nmillion barrels of crude into the  Gulf of Mexico  over 85 days.\nLawsuits tied to the disaster exceed 300.  Aug. 3: Bloomberg News reports the U.S. is examining\nwhether BP made misleading statements after the spill, and\nwhether company executives traded stock based on inside\ninformation about the accident. The Justice Department is\ninvestigating possible criminal wrongdoing and the Securities\nand Exchange Commission is probing potential civil violations,\nsaid a person familiar with the matter.  Aug. 10: A panel of judges orders that all claims tied to\nthe disaster be consolidated before one judge in New Orleans\nfederal court, U.S. District Judge  Carl Barbier .  Sept. 19: The Macondo well is permanently sealed with\ncement pumped in through an emergency relief well drilled\nnearby.  Oct. 20: Environmental groups sue BP, saying it should pay\ndamages and create a fund to restore wildlife and habitats\nharmed by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. At least 27 federally\nprotected species inhabiting the Gulf region were harmed by\nspill, the groups say.  Oct. 27: Halliburton is ordered by the judge overseeing the\nspill suits to turn over cement used on the Deepwater Horizon\nproject to investigators from the Coast Guard and the Department\nof the Interior in connection with a probe of the spill.  Oct. 28: The National Oil Commission reports that\nHalliburton cement used on the BP well in April was unstable.  Dec. 15: The Obama administration sues BP and four other\ncompanies for violating environmental laws, seeking damages\nunder the Clean Water Act. The suit seeks a declaration that\nfour of the defendants are liable under the Oil Pollution Act\nfor all removal costs and damages caused by the oil spill,\nincluding damages to the environment. In addition to London-\nbased BP, the owner of the well, defendants include units of\nTransocean, which owned the rig, as well as  Anadarko Petroleum\nCorp. (APC)  and MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC, part owners of the well.  BP  shares  fall the most in almost four months.  Jan. 13, 2011: The family of Karl Kleppinger Jr. becomes\nthe first to settle a lawsuit against rig owner Transocean and\nother companies involved in the disaster over the deaths of 11\ncrew members of the Deepwater Horizon.  March 3: Louisiana sues BP and its partners in the well,\nseeking $1 million a day for damages caused by the spill.  April 15:  Cameron International Corp. (CAM)  says in a court\nfiling that it isn\u2019t to blame for the rig explosion because oil\nand gas were surging toward it when workers tried to activate\nblowout-prevention equipment. Plaintiffs suing the companies\nclaim Houston-based Cameron\u2019s blowout preventer wasn\u2019t designed\nto handle the extreme environment and thicker drill pipes found\nin ultra-deep wells such as the Macondo.  April 19: Mitsui & Co.\u2019s Moex Offshore LLC unit, a 10\npercent partner with BP in the blown-out well, sues the U.K.-\nbased energy company for economic losses as a result of the\nproject\u2019s failure and the spill that followed. Moex, claiming BP\nbroke its partnership agreement, asks the judge in the case to\ndeclare it isn\u2019t responsible for damages and cleanup costs.  April 20: BP sues Transocean, blaming the owner and\noperator of the Deepwater Horizon for the accident and seeking\nto recover costs for billions of dollars in damages. BP says\nthat without Transocean\u2019s \u201cmisconduct\u201d there wouldn\u2019t have\nbeen any explosion, fire, deaths or oil spill.  Aug. 23: The Gulf Coast Claims Facility, which draws on the\n$20 billion set aside by BP after the spill, has received more\nthan 947,000 claims from 50 states and 36 nations, according to\na summary by claims administrator Feinberg. BP has paid more\nthan $5 billion to 204,434 claimants in the past year from the\nfund, created to compensate victims of the spill. In total,\nabout $6.7 billion has been drawn from the fund, which also pays\nfor clean-up costs and restoration projects through payments\nprovided to local governments.  Aug. 26: Businesses and individuals suing BP and other\ncompanies involved in the spill win the judge\u2019s approval to seek\npunitive damages in pursuing claims of economic and\nenvironmental losses. BP and the other companies claimed the\nU.S. Oil Pollution Act prevented plaintiffs from collecting\npunitive damages. Barbier rules the statute is \u201csilent as to\nthe availability of punitive damages\u201d and plaintiffs can pursue\nsuch claims under maritime law. Barbier dismisses economic loss\nclaims by individuals and businesses filed under state law.  Sept. 15: BP won\u2019t have to face some lawsuits filed by\ninstitutional investors on behalf of the company, a federal\njudge in Houston rules. U.S. District Judge Keith P. Ellison\nagrees with BP\u2019s argument that the claims should be filed in\nU.K. courts because the company is based there.  Sept. 30: Barbier rules Anadarko won\u2019t have to face\npersonal injury claims arising from exposure to oil and other\nchemicals in the cleanup of the spill. Anadarko and Moex can\u2019t\nbe held responsible for these claims under maritime law, he\nsays.  Nov. 1: A Transocean unit asks the judge to order BP to\nhonor a blanket indemnity against oil spill damages that the rig\nowner claims was part of its drilling contract.  Nov. 14: The judge rules BP must face claims over the spill\nby Louisiana and  Alabama . The states can sue for negligence and\nproduct liability under general maritime law and are eligible\nfor punitive damages, Barbier says. He dismisses claims brought\nunder state environmental laws, including demands for civil\npenalties, finding they were preempted by federal law governing\nthe Outer Continental Shelf.  Dec. 9: Mexican states and Alabama cities that are deemed\ntoo far removed from the spill to have been physically harmed by\nit are barred by the court from bringing some claims against BP.\nBarbier throws out state law claims by six Louisiana parishes\nseeking penalties over wildlife killed or injured by the spill.\nHe says the parishes, as counties in the state are called, can\nstill sue BP and other spill companies under U.S. law to recover\nwildlife losses, spill damages and removal costs.  Jan. 2, 2012: BP seeks to have Halliburton, the cement\ncontractor for the Macondo well, pay all of the  oil company \u2019s\nrelated costs and damages tied to the spill. BP has paid more\nthan $21 billion in cleanup costs and economic damages to\nindividuals, businesses and governments harmed by the spill as\nof Dec. 1, the company says. BP reserved more than $40 billion\nto cover costs related to the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon\ndrilling rig.  Jan. 26: BP can\u2019t collect from Transocean part of the $40\nbillion in cleanup costs and economic losses caused by the 2010\noil well blowout and spill, the judge rules. He also holds that\nBP must indemnify Transocean for pollution-related economic\ndamage claims under its drilling contract. Any awards for\npunitive damages against Transocean or civil penalties under the\nU.S. Clean Water Act won\u2019t have to be covered by BP, the judge\nalso writes.  Jan. 31: BP is ordered to cover some of any direct damage\nclaims awarded against Halliburton for the $40 billion in\ncleanup costs and economic losses caused by the spill. BP must\nindemnify Halliburton for compensatory damage claims under its\ndrilling contract, Barbier rules. BP had sued Halliburton to\nrecover a share of any damages and costs from the spill. Any\npunitive damages awarded against Halliburton don\u2019t have to be\npaid by BP, the judge says.  Feb. 9: Bloomberg News reveals  BP is negotiating with U.S.\nofficials to settle the pollution claims tied to the oil spill.\nThe U.S. seeks fines of as much as $4,300 for each of the 4.1\nmillion barrels spilled after the rig explosion.  BP wins a ruling barring the introduction of evidence at\ntrial of previous accidents involving the oil company. Barbier\ngrants a BP motion blocking the introduction of exhibits\npertaining to prior industrial accidents, including the 2005\nexplosion at its  Texas  City, Texas, refinery and a 2006 oil\nspill at its Prudhoe Bay field in  Alaska .  Feb. 13: BP was told it must face fraud claims by investors\nwho said the company lied before and after the 2010 spill about\nits accident response capability. Judge Ellison in Houston\nallows holders of BP American depositary receipts to pursue\nclaims alleging violations of U.S. securities law. He dismisses\nclaims by investors who bought ordinary shares of London-based\nBP, saying his court has no jurisdiction over them.  Feb. 17:  MOEX (MOEX)  agrees to pay $90 million to the U.S. and\nfive states to settle pollution violations related to the spill\nwhile BP and its drilling fluid provider for the Macondo well\nagree to dismiss claims against each other. The U.S. files a\nconsent order outlining the MOEX settlement of Clean Water Act\nviolations. The agreement requires MOEX to pay $45 million in\ncivil penalties to the U.S. and about $25 million total to\nAlabama,  Florida , Louisiana,  Mississippi  and Texas. MOEX will\nalso pay $20 million for land acquisition projects.  Feb. 24: Transocean claims BP officials overseeing the\nMacondo well ignored questions about whether safety tests done\nhours before a fatal blast on the drilling rig were flawed.\n Donald Vidrine , the senior BP manager on the Deepwater Horizon\non April 20, 2010, talked with an engineer about unsatisfactory\nwell tests less than an hour before an explosion killed 11\nworkers on the rig and sent oil pouring into the waters off\nLouisiana, Transocean\u2019s attorneys say in a filing. While Mark Hafle, a Houston-based BP drilling engineer, warned Vidrine in a\nphone call that stability tests on the well might be flawed,\n\u201cneither man stopped work\u201d at the facility, Transocean says.  Feb. 26: The scheduled Feb. 27 trial is delayed by Barbier\nuntil March 5 to allow settlement negotiations to continue.  Bloomberg News later reports that BP and lawyers for\nbusinesses and individuals affected by the spill were near a $14\nbillion accord to be funded with money set aside for out-of-\ncourt settlements. Three people familiar with the talks say\nthat, under the plan, BP would close its $20 billion Gulf Coast\nClaims Facility and shift the remaining $14 billion to\nplaintiffs hurt by the disaster. Such a deal wouldn\u2019t include\nfines by the federal government that could reach $17.6 billion,\nlawsuits by state governments or claims between BP and partner\ncompanies involved in the disaster.
