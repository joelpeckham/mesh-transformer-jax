 "context": "The following article called 'Transparency, Yield Drop Forecast After Kirchner's Death: Argentina Credit' was published on 2010-10-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe death of former Argentine\nPresident  Nestor Kirchner  is spurring speculation that the\nnation\u2019s statistical reporting will become more transparent,\nhelping the country lower its borrowing costs.  Bonds rallied, cutting their yield spread over U.S.\nTreasuries to the smallest since June 2008, after Kirchner died\nof a heart attack yesterday. The 60-year-old former lawyer, who\nunderwent heart surgery twice this year, was rushed to the\nhospital in the company of his wife, President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner , after falling ill at their home. The\ngovernment declared three days of mourning, and Kirchner will\nlie in state at the government palace in Buenos Aires today.  Kirchner\u2019s death makes it more likely that an opposition\ncandidate will win next year\u2019s presidential election, paving the\nway for an overhaul of the statistics  institute , where he\nreplaced key personnel in 2007 before being succeeded by\nFernandez, according to Augustus Asset Management Ltd. Goldman\nSachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc estimate annual inflation is\nabout 25 percent in South America\u2019s second-biggest economy, more\nthan double the 11.1 percent rate reported by the agency.  \u201cOne of the key policies with which Kirchner was most\nclosely associated was the manipulation of the inflation data,\u201d\nsaid  Paul McNamara , who oversees $4.5 billion of emerging-market\ndebt, including inflation-linked peso bonds, at Augustus in\nLondon.  \u2018Sympathy\u2019 Votes  Kirchner said in July that either he or Fernandez, 57,\nwould run for president next year.  The yield on the inflation-linked notes due in 2033 dropped\n60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage point, yesterday to 8.21\npercent, compared with a 59 basis point drop to 8.94 percent on\nits dollar bonds due that same year, according to Itau Unibanco\nHolding SA. The inflation-linked bond yield rose one basis point\ntoday, while the dollar bond was unchanged at 9:18 a.m. New York\ntime.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Argentine bonds\ninstead of U.S. Treasuries sank 49 basis points yesterday, the\nmost in a year, to 533, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s\nEMBI+ index. It fell another five basis points today.  The gains are \u201ca vote of no confidence from financial\nmarkets\u201d in Kirchner and Fernandez,  Siobhan Morden , an analyst\nat Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Stamford, Connecticut,\nsaid in a phone interview. The rally may be limited should\nKirchner\u2019s death create \u201csympathy\u201d for Fernandez among\nArgentines, bolstering her chances in next year\u2019s election,\nMorden said.  Bond Rout  \u201cThese recent gains could quickly reverse,\u201d she said.  The yield gap over Treasuries is down from 807 at the end\nof May and 910 in June 2005, when Kirchner completed the\nharshest sovereign debt restructuring since World War II,\naccording to  Arturo Porzecanski , an international finance\nprofessor at American University in Washington. The government\ndefaulted on $95 billion of debt in 2001.  \u201cThe normalization of statistics will accelerate\u201d after\nKirchner\u2019s death, Miguel Kiguel, a former finance undersecretary\nwho runs research company Econviews in Buenos Aires, said in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable that Argentina does it,\nwhether this government or the next, but there\u2019s now a\npossibility that some progress can be made.\u201d  Workers at the statistics institute, including  Graciela Bevacqua , the former consumer price index director, said the\ninflation reports were being manipulated by the government.\nKirchner and Fernandez have said the institute\u2019s figures are\naccurate.  Yields on the government\u2019s inflation-linked bonds due in\n2033, one of the securities turned over to creditors in the 2005\nrestructuring, soared 275 basis points in 2007 as the data-\nrigging concerns prompted investors to dump the securities.  Defaulted Debt  In the 2005 settlement, Kirchner offered bonds to creditors\nworth 30 cents on the dollar in exchange for $95 billion of debt\nthe government defaulted on in 2001. That offer was rejected by\nabout 25 percent of investors, prompting Fernandez to settle\nwith holders of $12.2 billion of the securities in June.  Creditors including billionaire investor  Kenneth Dart  and\nElliott Management Corp., a New York-based hedge fund, are still\nsuing the government in international courts for repayment of\nthe debt.  Warrants linked to economic growth rose 0.17 cent to 13.08\ncents today after jumping 0.45 cent yesterday, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. The peso slid 0.1 percent to 3.9612 per\ndollar today, from 3.9568 on Oct. 26. Local markets were closed\nyesterday for a nationwide census.  \u2018Strong, Confrontational\u2019  The  cost  of protecting Argentine debt against non-payment\nfor five years with credit-default swaps tumbled 52 basis points\nto 647 yesterday, according to data provider CMA. Credit-default\nswaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying\nsecurities or the cash equivalent should a government or company\nfail to adhere to debt agreements.  A shift to a more \u201cmarket-friendly\u201d government may push\ndown Argentina\u2019s five-year default  swaps  to about 350 basis\npoints after the elections, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s  Eduardo Suarez  said.  Argentine dollar bonds have returned 36 percent this year,\nmore than double the 16 percent gain in emerging-market debt, as\nthe June debt restructuring and a quickening economic expansion\nhelped restore investor confidence in the country.  Argentina\u2019s 8.73 percent average dollar bond yield is still\nmore than 300 basis points over the 5.32 percent average yield\non emerging-market debt. Only debt issued by Venezuela and\nEcuador yields more in JPMorgan\u2019s benchmark EMBI+ index.  Kirchner took office in 2003, in the wake of Argentina\u2019s\ndefault and a devaluation that forced his elected predecessor,\nFernando de la Rua, to resign amid deadly protests.  Kirchner was \u201ca politician and president with strong,\nconfrontational policies,\u201d Kiguel said. \u201cThat has been\nnegative for the country.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Drew Benson  in Buenos Aires at \n abenson9@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDavid Papadopoulos at \n papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 27.728439331054688 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
