The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nING U.S. Inc., an insurance unit of\nthe largest Dutch financial-services company, filed for an\ninitial public offering as the parent company narrows its focus.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  will lead the ING\nU.S. share sale, according to a regulatory filing from the New\nYork-based unit. The IPO could raise 5.5 billion euros ($7\nbillion) in proceeds, Cor Kluis, an Utrecht, Netherlands-based\nanalyst at Rabobank International, said in a note dated Nov. 7.  ING Groep NV (INGA)  was ordered by the European Union to sell\ninsurance operations, its U.S. online bank and a Dutch mortgage\nlender before the end of 2013 as a condition for approval of a\n2008 bailout. The U.S. unit, led by ex- American International\nGroup Inc. (AIG)  executive Rodney Martin, competes with  MetLife Inc. (MET) \nand  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  selling savings products as\nworkers rely less on their employers for pensions.  \u201cWe have leading positions in our retirement solutions and\ninsurance solutions businesses,\u201d ING U.S. said in the filing.\n\u201cThe weakening of historical safety nets provided by\ngovernments and employers, such as  Social Security  and defined\nbenefit plans, are increasing the need for Americans to plan for\ntheir own long-term financial security.\u201d  The U.S. unit has about 13 million customers and offers\nsavings products and annuities in addition to  life insurance ,\naccording to the filing. ING U.S.\u2019s total revenue declined 7.4\npercent in the six months through June 30 from a year earlier to\n$4.85 billion, while net income fell 58 percent to $331 million,\naccording to the regulatory filing.  Asset Sales  ING said in January it would review non-essential banking\nassets after a target of repaying its government bailout in 2012\nbecame less certain amid Europe\u2019s debt crisis and stiffer\nregulatory burdens.  ING Chief Executive Officer Jan Hommen sold the Amsterdam-\nbased company\u2019s U.S. online bank to  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) \nfor about $9 billion this year and disposed of the Latin\nAmerican insurance operations last year. He\u2019s also agreed to\nsell the Canadian online bank to Bank of  Nova Scotia . AIA Group\nLtd., the third-largest Asia-based insurer, agreed last month to\nbuy ING\u2019s Malaysia insurance business.  The filing lists the U.S. IPO for $100 million, a\nplaceholder number used to calculate registration fees. ING\u2019s\nbook value was $12.8 billion as of June 30, according to the\nfiling.  MetLife, based in New York, trades for about 56 percent of\nits  book value  of $64.6 billion. Prudential trades for 64\npercent of the measure of assets minus liabilities.  Interest rates near record lows and stock market volatility\nhave pressured results at life insurers, which invest customer\npayments to generate profits and back future obligations.  Renewed Pressure  \u201cDifficult market conditions are negatively affecting\nindustry returns and valuations, and pressuring key credit\nmetrics,\u201d  Fitch Ratings  said in a statement yesterday. \u201cThis\nplaces renewed pressure on U.S. life insurers struggling to\nrebound from the financial crisis.\u201d  Martin, 60, in September promoted Alain Karaoglan, another\nex-AIG manager, to be chief operating officer as the unit\nprepares for the IPO. Karaoglan helped AIG in 2010 with the IPO\nof AIA for more than $20 billion.
