The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTax-free separation creates two premier and independently focused Appalachian-based energy companies\nPITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) today announced that its Board of Directors has unanimously approved a plan to separate its upstream and midstream businesses, creating a standalone publicly traded corporation (NewCo) that will focus on midstream operations. The separation is intended to qualify as tax-free to EQT shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter 2018. Under the separation plan, EQT shareholders will retain their shares of EQT stock and receive a pro-rata share of the new independent midstream company. Both companies will remain headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA.\n\"The decision to build our midstream business in parallel with upstream growth has created one of the strongest midstream companies in the Appalachian Basin,\" said James Rohr, EQT\u2019s lead independent director. \"We have taken many steps to highlight the value of our midstream assets through a series of transactions including, the initial public offering of EQM, midstream asset dropdowns to EQM, and the initial public offering of EQGP. This transaction represents a new chapter for our business as we unlock the value created during the past 10 years.\"\nSteve Schlotterbeck, EQT\u2019s president and chief executive officer, said, \u201cWhen we announced the Rice Energy acquisition, we committed to addressing the sum-of-the-parts discount in our shares. The Rice transaction accelerated the maturation of both our businesses, provided scale that significantly enhanced the standalone prospects of both companies, and positioned us to further enhance value through separation. We are now the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. \u2013 with a strong and strategic midstream system in the best natural gas basin in the country. We will complete the separation with urgency, consistent with our commitment to shareholders.\u201d\nBenefits of Separation\nEQT believes that creating an independent midstream public company offers a number of benefits to the standalone businesses, including:\nPure-play companies providing a clear investment thesis Visibility to attract a long-term investor base suited to each business Capital structures aligned with cash flow risk/reward profiles Dedicated management and boards focused on distinct strategic visions Simpler and easier to understand financial reporting More efficient allocation of capital Enhanced potential for customer base expansion and organic growth Investment grade ratings expected for both companies More attractive equity currency and access to capital\nMidstream plan of action prior to separation\nEQT plans to pursue the following:\nA drop-down of the retained midstream assets in an accretive transaction to EQT Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: EQM) A merger of EQM and Rice Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: RMP) in an accretive transaction A sale of the RMP Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs) to EQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE: EQGP)\nUnder EQT\u2019s plan, EQGP will retain the EQM IDRs, and EQGP and EQM will remain separate publicly traded entities after separation. EQT does not intend to modify its existing gathering and transmission contracts with EQM in connection with the separation.
