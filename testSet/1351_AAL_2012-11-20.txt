 "context": "The following article called 'Eskom Profit Falls as Strikes, Slow Growth Cut Power Demand' was published on 2012-11-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEskom Holdings SOC Ltd., the state-\nowned supplier of about 95 percent of  South Africa \u2019s power, said\nfirst-half profit fell as strikes and slower growth in the\ncontinent\u2019s biggest economy curbed demand.  Profit after tax declined to 12.6 billion rand ($1.4\nbillion) in the six months through September from 12.8 billion\nrand a year earlier, the company said in a statement handed to\nreporters in Johannesburg today. Power sales retreated 2.9\npercent to 110,766 gigawatt hours, it said.  South Africa\u2019s economy is growing this year at the slowest\npace since a 2009 recession as strikes that started in platinum\nmines and spread to gold operations cut output and exports. The\nutility is seeking a 16 percent increase in average electricity\nprices each year until 2018 to avoid a repeat of energy\nshortages that halted mines in 2008.  The labor unrest at mines contributed to lagging demand,\nand Eskom would consider breaking even at the end of the fiscal\nyear a good performance, Chief Executive Officer  Brian Dames \ntold reporters in Johannesburg. \u201cAll of that impact we will\nfeel toward our year-end results,\u201d he said.  Revenue advanced 15 percent to 73.4 billion rand as tariffs\nclimbed, and primary energy costs rose 14 percent, Eskom said.  The company expects sales to drop to 219,342 gigawatt hours\nin the year through March from a budgeted 222,083 gigawatt\nhours, according to its interim report.  \u201cAt best, if we achieve breakeven results, that would be a\ngreat performance,\u201d Dames said.  Expansion Plans  The  National Energy Regulator of South Africa  is to make a\ndecision on Eskom\u2019s application by the end of February, after\npublic hearings. An annual 16 percent increase would raise\nprices to 128 cents per kilowatt hour by 2017 from 61 cents.  Eskom is spending about 500 billion rand through 2017\nreviving old  power plants  and building new ones to overcome a\ngeneration capacity shortage. It increased tariffs by an average\n25 percent each of the last six years.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,\n Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Anglo American Plc (AAL) \u2019s aluminum, ferrochrome and\nplatinum smelters are among its largest customers.  The utility has asked the regulator to review a power-\nsupply deal with  BHP Billiton , the biggest mining company,\ndrafted when Eskom had surplus capacity, spokeswoman Hilary Joffe said in an e-mail yesterday.  Rating Assessment  Standard & Poor\u2019s  downgrade of Eskom\u2019s credit rating to\nmatch a lower sovereign rating is a concern, the utility said\nOct. 17. Moody\u2019s also downgraded the utility last month.  \u201cInvestment-grade status is necessary to secure the\nbalance of funding and is critical for long-term expansion,\u201d\nEskom Finance Director Paul O\u2019Flaherty said today.  Eskom expects power shortages to last until the end of\n2013, when the first unit of the Medupi coal power plant it\u2019s\nbuilding in the north starts generating electricity. The nation\nhad rolling blackouts across the country in the first quarter of\n2008 as Eskom rotated the limited power available.  The government prevented Eskom from expanding from 2004 to\n2008 as it sought to attract investments in the power industry.\nThe tariff increase includes 3 percent to support the\nintroduction of independent renewable energy power producers\nthrough a bid program of 3,725 megawatts.  Last week, SolarReserve LLC, a closely held U.S. solar-\nenergy developer, closed on $586 million in equity and debt\nfinancing for two South African projects. Mainstream Renewable\nPower Ltd. said it will begin building one wind and two solar\nplants costing 500 million euros ($636 million) after agreeing\non power-purchase, funding and implementation deals with the\nstate.  O\u2019Flaherty will leave the company in July, the company\nsaid. He was appointed to his position about three years ago to\nput in place funding for the new building program, consolidate,\nand standardize management of the utility\u2019s capital program, the\ncompany said.
