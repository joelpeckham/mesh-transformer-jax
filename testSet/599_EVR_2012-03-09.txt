The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNews Corp. (NWSA) \u2019s involvement in the U.K.\nphone-hacking and bribery scandal has drawn attention from\nregulators, who are examining the company\u2019s fitness to hold a\nbroadcasting license through its stake in  British Sky\nBroadcasting Group Plc. (BSY)   The scandal, set off when News Corp.\u2019s reporters were found\nto have hacked into sources\u2019 phones and bribed police for\nstories, is being scrutinized by a special team, dubbed\n\u201cProject Apple,\u201d at media regulator Ofcom, according to\nminutes released under a Freedom of Information Act request\npublished on Ofcom\u2019s website.  Ofcom, which has the ability to revoke a broadcaster\u2019s\nlicense, will determine whether the scandal has compromised News\nCorp.\u2019s ability to manage the U.K.\u2019s biggest pay-TV company.\n James Murdoch , son of News Corp. Chief Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch , is the chairman of BSkyB and previously oversaw News\nCorp.\u2019s U.K. publishing unit.  \u201cI would assume his goal is to remain chairman, but if the\nregulator forces the issue, I would think he\u2019ll step down as\nopposed to the other option, which is News Corp. selling its\nshares in BSkyB,\u201d said  Alan Gould , an analyst at  Evercore\nPartners (EVR)  in New York. Gould rates the shares \u201coverweight\u201d and\ndoesn\u2019t own any.  Bid Scrapped  BSkyB fell as much as 13.5 pence, or 2 percent, to 680.5\npence and traded at 684 pence as of 8:07 a.m. in London. The\nstock has fallen 6.6 percent this year, valuing the company at\n11.7 billion pounds ($18.5 billion). News Corp. added 0.9\npercent to $19.61 in New York yesterday.  The phone-hacking scandal prompted News Corp., which owns\n39 percent of BSkyB, to drop a 7.8 billion-pound bid to buy the\nremaining shares last year. News Corp.\u2019s tabloid employees were\nfound to have hacked into the phones of celebrities and\npoliticians and bribed police. The News of the World was shut in\nJuly and more than 10 journalists at the company\u2019s Sun tabloid\nhave been arrested, though not charged.  Ofcom has said it\u2019s been monitoring the investigations\nsince July.  Jack Horner , a spokesman for News Corp., and BSkyB\u2019s\nStephen Gaynor declined to comment.  \u201cIn relation to the hacking and corruption allegations,\nnew evidence is still emerging from the various enquiries,\u201d\nOfcom said in an e-mail yesterday. \u201cOfcom is continuing to\nassess the evidence -- including new and emerging evidence --\nthat may assist it in discharging these duties.\u201d  Re-Election  The U.K. Parliament is expected to issue a statement\ncritical of James Murdoch\u2019s management of the newspapers, where\nhe claims to have had no knowledge of widespread hacking and\nbribery practices.  While the younger Murdoch was re-elected chairman of BSkyB\nin November, he failed to get the support of almost one third of\nthe independent shareholders in a vote. He has stepped away from\nhis duties at News Corp.\u2019s British unit to focus on his new role\nas deputy chief operating officer at the company\u2019s  New York \nheadquarters.  James Murdoch, 39, became CEO of BSkyB in 2003 and left\nthat post in 2007 to run News Corp.\u2019s television, newspaper and\ndigital operations in  Europe ,  Asia  and the  Middle East . At the\ntime, he was named non-executive chairman of BSkyB.  News Corp. dropped its bid for BSkyB in July amid pressure\nfrom politicians including Prime Minister David Cameron and\nopposition Labour Party leader  Ed Miliband , who intensified\ncalls to review the Murdochs\u2019 influence in local media.  Parallel Probes  In addition to three police investigations and the\nparliamentary inquiry, Cameron commissioned a judge-led\ninvestigation into media ethics headed by Brian Leveson. Leveson\nand his lawyers have questioned publishers, journalists, police,\ncelebrities and hacking victims and may recommend additional\nregulations to police media behavior.  \u201cNews Corp. executives and non-executive directors have\nshown themselves completely unable to control what was going on\nin the paper and make sure the company\u2019s acting within the\nlaw,\u201d Chris Bryant, a Labour lawmaker, said in July. \u201cThat\nraises questions about whether they should have any stake in\nBSkyB.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAmy Thomson in  London  at \n athomson6@bloomberg.net ;\nJonathan Browning in London at \n jbrowning9@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nKenneth Wong at \n kwong11@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Evercore Partners Inc was 21.27496337890625 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Evercore Partners Inc was ",
