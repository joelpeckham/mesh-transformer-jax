The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDock workers in  Brazil  held up\nloading at Latin America\u2019s biggest port earlier today in a\nprotest over  job security  as they consider a strike that would\ndisrupt shipments of everything from sugar to soybeans and corn.  Protests began at Cargill Inc. and Cosan SA Industria &\nComercio terminals in the Port of Santos as part of a six-hour\nstoppage in six states, said Miguel Torres, the vice-president\nof labor union Forca Sindical. Workers aim to reach an accord\nwith the government to secure union jobs in a proposed port-\ninvestment bill by March 15 or may go on strike, union leader\nPaulo Pereira da Silva told reporters in Brasilia today after a\nmeeting with Ports Minister Leonidas Cristino.  Brazil is the world\u2019s largest exporter of coffee, sugar and\nsoybeans, and supplies are now arriving from record harvests.\nWith chronic truck shortages, clogged roads and scarce railroad\ncapacity, the government\u2019s port bill seeks to lure investment at\nports that may hire non-union workers. Soybean prices have\nrallied 4.8 percent this week in  Chicago , the most since August,\nboosting costs for importers including  China , the largest buyer\nof farm commodities.  \u201cThis bill is changing the rules of the game and will make\nlife worse for dock workers,\u201d said Torres, whose union\nrepresents 36,009 port workers, or 80 percent of Brazil\u2019s total.  Shipping Delays  About 7 million metric tons of soybean deliveries are being\nheld up at Brazilian ports, boosting prices, Kuok Khoon Hong,\nthe chief executive officer of cooking-oil supplier  Wilmar\nInternational Ltd. (WIL) , said today in an interview in  Singapore .\nCrushers in China boosted purchases from the U.S. this week on\nconcern that a strike in Brazil will disrupt shipping,\nresearcher Shanghai JC Intelligence Co. said today.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 0.3 percent to\n$14.745 a bushel at 10:51 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,\nafter reaching a two-week high of $14.97. Arabica-coffee and\norange-juice futures advanced for a third day in  New York .  Brazil ports have a record 192 ships waiting to load 10.8\nmillion metric tons of soybeans, corn, wheat and rice, compared\nwith 90 ships waiting to load 4.1 million tons a year earlier,\nresearcher SA Commodities said in a report distributed in Santos\ntoday.  Brazil\u2019s government is weighing changes in its proposed\nregulatory framework for ports to avert a strike that could hurt\ntrade in  Latin America \u2019s largest economy, Minister Cristino said\nin an interview in Brasilia yesterday.  New Meeting  In a meeting with the government today, union leaders\nagreed to cancel a second six-hour stoppage scheduled for Feb.\n26 and a new meeting was slated for March 1, Cristino told\nreporters after the talks in Brasilia.  \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in changing the essence of the\nmeasure on ports because it will boost cargo shipments with\nlower costs,\u201d Cristino said.  Justice Maria Cristina Peduzzi, vice-president of Brazil\u2019s\nSuperior Labor Tribunal, known as TST, ordered the workers to\nrefrain from going on strike and may fine the union 200,000\nreais ($101,700) if the go ahead with the stoppage, according to\nthe court\u2019s website.  Expiring terminal concessions held by Cargill, Cosan,\n Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  and Libra Terminais SA will probably\nbe renewed if the companies boost investments, he said.  Cargill is the U.S.\u2019s biggest agricultural company. Cosan\nruns the world\u2019s biggest sugar-cane processor in a joint venture\nwith  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , and ADM is the world\u2019s largest corn\nprocessor.
