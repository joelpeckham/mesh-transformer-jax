The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBertelsmann AG (BTG)  plans legal changes\nthat may pave the way for an initial public offering, indicating\nthe 177-year-old company\u2019s owner is relaxing its opposition to a\nshare sale under new Chief Executive Officer Thomas Rabe.  Europe\u2019s largest media company plans to convert into\n Bertelsmann  SE & Co. KGaA by June 30, a legal form that\nfacilitates additional private investment, including a possible\nshare sale, Rabe said in Berlin today.  The Mohn family, which resisted taking Bertelsmann public\nin the past decade, initiated the change, according to Rabe. The\nformer chief financial officer, who took over as CEO at the\nstart of the year, aims to rekindle growth by expanding the BMG\nmusic-rights unit, establish Bertelsmann in the education-\nservices market and boosting its presence in  China  and  India .  \u201cThe strategic priority for us is now to improve the\ngrowth profile of Bertelsmann,\u201d Rabe said. The company makes\nabout 80 percent of its sales in  Europe  and lackluster growth\nthere means it needs to enter faster-growing markets, he said.  The legal change will give the Guetersloh, Germany-based\ncompany more flexibility to raise funds for the planned\nexpansion, said Rabe, speaking to journalists before he\npresented the company\u2019s full-year earnings.  \u201cWe\u2019re facing a strategic reshaping, and of course we have\nto see how we finance such a transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis\nalso includes the option to potentially take the company to the\nstock exchange, if that turns out to be the best path for us and\nfor our shareholders.\u201d  Seeking \u2018Inspiration\u2019  The Mohn family, which owns 19.1 percent of Bertelsmann\naccording to the company\u2019s website, engineered the ouster of\nformer CEO  Thomas Middelhoff  in 2002 because he sought to sell\nshares to fund faster growth, investors said at the time.  The company, which controls Europe\u2019s largest television\nbroadcaster  RTL Group SA (RTL) , reported a 1.2 percent increase in\nrevenue last year. The publishing business, whose brands include\n Random House , reported declining sales for the period.  The KGaA legal form is used by members of  Germany \u2019s\nbenchmark DAX Index including  Henkel AG (HEN3) , the maker of Loctite\nsuperglue, drugmaker  Merck KGaA (MRK)  and kidney dialysis company\n Fresenius Medical Care AG (FME) .  These companies \u201caren\u2019t setting an example, but of course\nthey give us inspiration,\u201d Rabe said, adding that Bertelsmann\nwill remain an \u201cindependent family company.\u201d  The rest of Bertelsmann is held by foundations, including\nthe Bertelsmann Foundation and the Reinhard Mohn Foundation,\nwhose boards count some Mohn family members.  Strategy Focus  Rabe, in his previous role as CFO, orchestrated the 4.5\nbillion-euros ($6 billion) purchase of a 25.1 percent\nBertelsmann stake from  Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA (GBLB)  in 2006 to\nreduce pressure for an initial public offering and return\ncontrol to the Mohns.  Since Rabe was promoted, Bertelsmann has set up a wider\nmanagement committee to advise the board on strategy, hired an\nexecutive to supervise expansion in new areas, and presented two\nnew candidates, Guillaume de Posch and Anke Schaeferkordt, to\nsucceed RTL CEO Gerhard Zeiler next month.  The company expects a \u201cmoderate\u201d increase in revenue and\noperating earnings before interest and taxes in 2012 and 2013,\nand profit this year will be higher than last year\u2019s 612 million\neuros as restructuring costs decline, the company said in its\nannual report today.  \u201cIt\u2019s not yet decided if and when and how we will take on\ncapital, what matters is that it meets the requirements of our\nstrategy,\u201d Rabe said.
