 "context": "The following article called 'Bausch & Lomb Owner Said to Seek Banks for IPO as Sale Falters' was published on 2013-02-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWarburg Pincus LLC is interviewing\nbanks for an initial public offering of Bausch & Lomb Inc. after\nan effort to sell the eye-care company resulted in disappointing\nbids, said people with knowledge of the matter.  The private-equity firm is soliciting pitches from  Bank of\nAmerica Corp. , Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, and\nJPMorgan Chase & Co., which financed the firm\u2019s 2007 buyout of\nBausch & Lomb, said one of the people, who asked not to be named\nbecause the process is private. New York-based Warburg had\nworked with  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  on finding a buyer for the\ncompany and had sought at least $10 billion, people familiar\nwith the process said in January. Goldman Sachs will likely work\nwith another bank on the IPO, another person said.  Warburg is pursuing an IPO to exit its investment after\nprivate bids came in at less than $9 billion, one of the people\nsaid. Additionally, Warburg and Bausch & Lomb have been\nencouraged by the performance of Zoetis Inc. since its January\ndebut, another person said. Zoetis, Pfizer Inc.\u2019s animal-health\nunit, raised $2.57 billion in its IPO, pricing the shares above\nthe marketed range, and has climbed 25 percent.  Warburg is weighing how to dispose of the business as it\nseeks investments for a new fund that documents obtained by\nBloomberg News show has a target of $12 billion. Warburg took\nBausch & Lomb private in a 2007 deal valued at $4.6 billion,\nincluding debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Contact Lenses  Abbott Laboratories (ABT) , Johnson & Johnson and  Sanofi (SAN)  all had\nshown interest in Bausch & Lomb, whose products include  contact\nlenses  and eye-care solutions, people said last month. Merck &\nCo. and Pfizer also considered offers, these people said.  Adam Grossberg, a spokesman for Bausch & Lomb, and  Jeffrey\nSmith , a spokesman for Warburg, declined to comment on the\nprocess. Representatives for Goldman Sachs, Bank of America,\nCitigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse declined to comment.  A $10 billion sale would give Warburg a more than 200\npercent gain on its $1.7 billion equity investment in the 2007\nbuyout, the people said in January.  Bausch & Lomb has three businesses: pharmaceuticals, vision\ncare and surgical, according to documents provided by the\ncompany in December. Pharmaceuticals and vision each account for\nabout 40 percent of sales, with the rest coming from surgical.  Since the buyout, Bausch & Lomb\u2019s earnings before interest,\ntaxes, depreciation and amortization have risen to just under\n$700 million from about $400 million, people familiar with the\ncompany\u2019s financial situation have said. The company projected\n2012 Ebitda of more than $700 million and double-digit revenue\ngrowth, another person said.  Geographically, about 40 percent of Bausch & Lomb\u2019s sales\ncome from  North America , 33 percent from Europe and the rest\nfrom  Asia  or  Latin America .
