 "context": "The following article called 'Dow Rallies Above 13,000 on Speculation ECB to Buy Bonds' was published on 2012-08-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  climbed above 13,000, capping its longest weekly advance since January, amid speculation the European Central Bank will buy bonds to help lower borrowing costs and preserve the euro.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  Caterpillar (CAT)  Inc. rose more than 3.1 percent to pace gains in the biggest companies.  Merck & Co. (MRK)  and  Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  added at least 4 percent, driving health-care shares higher, as earnings beat estimates.  Expedia Inc. (EXPE)  surged 20 percent as the online-travel company raised its dividend.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  fell 12 percent to a record low after its results.  About nine  stocks  rose for every two falling on U.S. exchanges at 4 p.m. New York time.

Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 7.9 billion shares, or 18 percent above the three-month average.  \u201cThey\u2019ve got to buy bonds,\u201d Michael Mullaney, who helps manage $9.5 billion as chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust in Boston, said in a phone interview. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric as far as opening up the checkbook for whatever needs to be done to stabilize the euroland. It\u2019s a giant deal if they actually do what they say they are prepared to do.\u201d  American stocks joined a global rally after two central bank officials said ECB President  Mario Draghi  will hold talks with Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann in an effort to overcome the biggest stumbling block to a new raft of measures including bond purchases. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President  Francois Hollande  echoed yesterday\u2019s pledge by Draghi that they will do everything to protect the euro.  Economic Data  In the U.S., data showed that the economy expanded at a slower pace in the second quarter as a softening job market prompted Americans to curb spending. Consumer confidence in July dropped to the lowest this year, according to a separate report. Cooling growth makes it harder to reduce unemployment, helping explain why Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has said policy makers stand ready with more stimulus if needed.  \u201cGrowth has decelerated sharply,\u201d said  Philip Orlando , the New York-based chief equity strategist at Federated Investors Inc., which oversees $355.9 billion. He spoke in a telephone interview. \u201cWe need something to reverse that downtrend and that \u2018something\u2019 is policy.\u201d  Consumers are cutting back just as Europe\u2019s crisis and looming U.S. tax-policy changes dent confidence, hurting sales at companies from United Parcel Service Inc. to Procter & Gamble Co. Sales at almost 60 percent of  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  companies which reported second-quarter results  missed  estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Still, 72 percent beat profit forecasts.

The largest biotechnology company reported profit topped analysts\u2019  estimates  on increased demand for its rheumatoid arthritis and bone drugs and it raised its 2012 forecast.  Medicaid Business  Coventry Health Care Inc. (CVH)  climbed 11 percent to $34.07. The company beat analysts\u2019 second-quarter  earnings  estimates because of increased membership in its U.S. government insurance programs and lower costs for its Medicaid business in Kentucky.

Expedia will lift its dividend 44 percent to 13 cents a share.  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  rallied 7.9 percent to $237.32.

Better Returns  Abby Joseph Cohen, the senior U.S. investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said equities will generate better returns than bonds for investors in the medium-to-long term.  \u201cIf we were to look just at fair-value estimates over the next year to three, we think that returns that are roughly 8 to 10 percent on the stock market are sensible,\u201d she said in an interview on \u201cBloomberg Surveillance\u201d today with  Tom Keene . \u201cIt is sensible as well for a long-term outlook, even though we assume that economic growth will not be as robust as it was in the years immediately prior to the financial crisis.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Rita Nazareth in New York at   rnazareth@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Lynn Thomasson at   lthomasson@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Amgen Inc. was 64.92306518554688 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Amgen Inc. was ",
