The coin, made of pure gold, weighs 100\nkilograms (3,215 ounces) and is 53 centimeters (21 inches) in\ndiameter, according to the Dorotheum\u2019s  website . The coin is\nworth $4 million, based on the metal\u2019s price yesterday.  \n Gold climbed to a record $1,265.30 an ounce on June 21 in\nLondon and has gained 14 percent this year as investors seek to\nprotect their wealth from Europe\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis and\nconcern the global economic recovery will falter. Purchases\nof coins are tightening supplies and boosting the premiums added\nto the price of bullion.  \n Oro Direct Sale S.L.U. sells gold products produced by the\nAustrian Mint and Argor Heraeus, according to its website.\nThe hammer price doesn\u2019t include a fee to be paid to the\nDorotheum, which drew eight bidders to the auction, Krumpl said.\nDorotheum declined to say the amount of the fee.  \n The Maple Leaf, listed in the current edition of Guinness\nWorld Records, was previously on loan to the collection of\nVienna\u2019s Kunsthistorisches Museum, according to the Dorotheum.\nOne side shows three maple leaves, Canada\u2019s national symbol, and\nthe other bears the image of  Queen Elizabeth II .  \n Liquidators  \n The coin was sold on behalf of the liquidators of Austrian\ninvestment and venture-capital firm  AvW Invest AG , Dorotheum\nspokeswoman Ingeborg Fiegl said on June 11. She was unable to\nidentify the liquidators.  \n Gold for immediate delivery was at $1,243.45 an ounce\nyesterday and traded at $1,251.70 at 1:13 p.m. in London today.\nThe metal is headed for a 10th consecutive annual gain, the\nlongest winning streak since at least 1920.  \n Investors have increased physical bullion holdings this\nyear, buying more coins and pushing holdings in gold-backed\nexchange-traded funds to a record. The  MSCI World Index  of\nequities fell 7.6 percent this year, while the euro slipped 14\npercent against the dollar.  \n Coin sales to European customers from the Perth Mint in\nAustralia surged in May, and South Africa\u2019s Rand Refinery Ltd.\nboosted production, while demand was strong enough to constitute\n\u201cpanic buying,\u201d Muenze Oesterreich AG, the Austrian mint said\nlast month. Premiums for coins such as Krugerrands and British\nsovereigns jumped compared with May, Dublin-based GoldCore Ltd.\nsaid this month.  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Nicholas Larkin  in London at \n nlarkin1@bloomberg.net ;\nJonathan Tirone in Vienna at \n jtirone@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     A Canadian hundred kilogram Maple leaf gold coin is displayed at the Dorotheum auction house in Vienna.
