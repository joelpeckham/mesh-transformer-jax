 "context": "The following article called 'SNB Pledges to Defend Franc Cap as Crisis Intensifies: Economy' was published on 2012-06-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Swiss central bank pledged to\nkeep defending its franc cap and left borrowing costs at zero to\nprotect the economy from \u201cexceptionally high\u201d risks as the\neuro area\u2019s crisis intensifies.  The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN) , led by President Thomas Jordan,\ntoday maintained the ceiling at 1.20 francs per euro and\nreiterated that it will uphold the measure \u201cwith the utmost\ndetermination.\u201d The Zurich-based  central bank  also kept its\n benchmark interest rate  on hold, as projected by all 20\neconomists in a Bloomberg News survey.  With  Europe \u2019s debt turmoil worsening and investors growing\nmore concerned about a euro breakup, pressure on the SNB to\ndefend the franc ceiling is increasing. The central bank\u2019s\nforeign-currency reserves surged to a record in May as policy\nmakers stepped up euro purchases to stave off attacks spurred by\nthe crisis. Jordan said at a briefing in Bern that there \u201cis no\nlimit\u201d to interventions and officials are considering emergency\nmeasures if the turmoil escalates.  \u201cEuropean developments have shown that the SNB hasn\u2019t\nchosen an easy instrument with the ceiling,\u201d said Felix Brill,\nan economist at Wellershoff & Partners Ltd. in Zurich. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nquestion of credibility. The SNB has signaled to investors that\nit won\u2019t give in and that it\u2019s ready to do more if needed.\u201d  The Swiss currency, which is considered a haven in times of\nglobal turmoil, was little changed today at 1.2009 per euro as\nof 11:48 a.m. in Zurich.  \u2018Upward Pressure\u2019  The euro region\u2019s fiscal woes \u201chave deteriorated\nseriously\u201d over the past months, sparking \u201cincreased upward\npressure\u201d on the franc, Jordan said. He called the franc\n\u201cstill high\u201d versus the euro at the current level.  \u201c Switzerland  will experience a significant economic\nslowdown over the rest of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risks for\nthe Swiss economic situation remain exceptionally high.\u201d  Policy makers raised their 2012 growth forecast to 1.5\npercent from about 1 percent after what they called an\n\u201cunexpectedly strong\u201d winter half-year.  The SNB kept its inflation forecasts largely unchanged.\n Consumer prices  will fall 0.5 percent this year, before rising\n0.3 percent in 2013 and 0.6 percent in 2014, the SNB said. In\nMarch, it forecast prices to drop 0.6 percent this year.  \u2018Unorthodox Tools\u2019  The central bank, which doesn\u2019t disclose details of its\nmarket operations, introduced the ceiling in September after the\nfranc\u2019s surge to near parity with the euro raised deflation\nthreats and eroded export competitiveness. Foreign-currency\nholdings rose to 303.8 billion francs ($316 billion) in May from\n237.6 billion francs in April as the turmoil worsened.  Jordan, 49, said the SNB \u201cwill not tolerate\u201d any further\nincrease in the franc and \u201cstands ready to take further\nmeasures at any time.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re obviously considering other measures\u201d that could\nbe used if there\u2019s an \u201cescalation of the crisis,\u201d he said.  Peter Rosenstreich, chief currency analyst at Swissquote\nBank SA in Geneva, said in an e-mailed note today the\nintroduction of \u201cunorthodox policy tools\u201d such as  capital\ncontrols  are \u201chighly unlikely\u201d as long as the economic\nrecovery remains steady.  Swiss Recovery  The franc ceiling has helped soften the impact of the euro\nregion\u2019s economic slump. The government on June 12 raised its\neconomic forecast for this year on stronger domestic demand. The\nKOF leading economic indicator rose for a fourth month in May\nand consumers were the most optimistic in a year in April.  Burckhardt Compression Holding AG (BCHN) , which sells compressors\nto  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , said on June 5 that new order growth may\nexceed 10 percent this year.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR) , the\nworld\u2019s second-biggest luxury goods company, last month reported\nfull-year profit that beat analysts\u2019 estimates.  Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG today lowered\ntheir forecasts for  China \u2019s growth this year.  South Korea \u2019s\ncentral bank Governor Kim Choong Soo reiterated his concerns\nabout the risks posed by excessive global liquidity and policy\nmakers in  New Zealand  and the  Philippines  kept their benchmark\n interest rates  unchanged.  The  European Central Bank  last week also kept borrowing\ncosts on hold ahead of Greek elections.  Greece  will vote on June\n17 on whether to back Alexis Tsipras, who wants to scrap the\nausterity plan dictated by the European Union and the\n International Monetary Fund  as a condition of its bailout.  SNB Diversification  Latest available data show the SNB has been reducing its\neuro exposure over the past two years. Euro holdings accounted\nfor 51 percent of reserves at the end of the first quarter, down\nfrom 70 percent in the second quarter of 2010. Reserves of\ndollars rose to 28 percent from 22 percent in that period.  Jordan said the SNB added currencies such as Australian and\nSingapore dollars as well as Danish krone and Swedish krona in\n2010 \u201cto diversify its investments further.\u201d  \u201cSince the first quarter of 2012, the SNB has also been\ninvesting in the Korean won,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditional investment\nopportunities in the advanced and emerging economies are\ncontinually being evaluated, both for bonds and for shares,\nalthough this is subject to an adequate level of liquidity in\nthe markets in question.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nKlaus Wille in Zurich at \n kwille@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nCraig Stirling at \n cstirling1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Exxon Mobil Corporation was 54.193546295166016 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Exxon Mobil Corporation was ",
