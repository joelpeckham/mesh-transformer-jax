(V) , the biggest bank-card\nnetwork, reported a fiscal third-quarter profit that beat\nanalysts\u2019 estimates as worldwide spending on credit and debit\ncards climbed.  Net income  for the three months ended June 30 was $1.23\nbillion, or $1.88 a share, compared with a loss of $1.84\nbillion, or $2.74, a year earlier that included a litigation\nexpense, the  Foster City , California-based firm said yesterday\nin a statement. The average  estimate  of 33 analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg was for earnings of $1.80 a share. Profit excluding\nspecial items from the third quarter of 2012 climbed 16 percent.  Chief Executive Officer  Charlie Scharf  is seeking to\nbolster Visa\u2019s business outside the U.S., where it gets more\nthan half its revenue, as consumers worldwide continue to\nmigrate from cash and checks to electronic payments. The company\nhas returned more than $15 billion to shareholders since 2008.  \u201cThe opportunity to move transactions from cash to\nelectronic means is still huge,\u201d Scharf said in a conference\ncall with analysts. \u201cThis is true in both the developed and the\ndeveloping parts of the world.\u201d  Visa rose 2 percent to $190.50 in  extended trading  in  New\nYork  yesterday after results were announced. The shares climbed\n23 percent this year through the close of regular trading,\noutpacing the 9.3 percent advance for the 70-company Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Information Technology Index.  Share Repurchases  The company repurchased $981 million of its stock during\nthe quarter at an average of $176.75 a share and may buy back an\nadditional $1.5 billion through next July, according to the\nstatement.

Revenue will increase about 13 percent\nthis fiscal year, according to the statement. Earnings per share\nwill rise by more than 20 percent, the company said, after an\nearlier forecast of \u201caround\u201d 20 percent.  Worldwide spending on Visa cards climbed 13 percent to\n$1.09 trillion, adjusted for currency fluctuations, according to\nthe statement. Processed transactions rose 14 percent to 15\nbillion. Cross-border purchases, or spending by cardholders\noutside their home countries, advanced 11 percent.

Visa sued Wal-Mart Stores\nInc. last month to stop the biggest U.S. retailer from filing a\nlawsuit that would prolong the eight-year legal battle the\nsettlement seeks to end.  Scharf, 48, has pledged to be more flexible in responding\nto the demands of Visa\u2019s business partners and in February the\ncompany reached agreement with JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest\nU.S. card issuer, to let the lender tailor payment solutions for\nmerchants.
