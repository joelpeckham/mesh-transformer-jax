 "context": "The following article called 'Verizon to Debut Data-Share Plan for Multiple Devices' was published on 2012-06-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVerizon Wireless , the largest U.S.\nmobile-phone carrier, will overhaul its data pricing this month\nwhen it debuts a shared-usage plan for multiple devices starting\nat $90 a month for one smartphone and 1 gigabyte of data.  The new Share Everything Plan includes unlimited calling\nand messaging bundled with a specific data allowance for as many\nas 10 Verizon Wireless phone lines. The offer will be available\nJune 28 and apply to all new customers, according to a\nstatement.  Verizon Wireless and  AT&T Inc. (T)  have been readying a shared-\ndata approach to billing to stop erosion of voice and text\nrevenue and emphasize one big bucket of Internet data to split\namong multiple users. The move away from separate plans for each\ndevice is intended to encourage customers to use more data and\nbuy larger monthly allotments.  \u201cToday\u2019s move by Verizon, while well telegraphed, is the\nmost profound change to pricing the telecom industry has seen in\n20 years,\u201d  Craig Moffett , a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  analyst\nin  New York , wrote in a research note.  With the new plans, Verizon will eliminate the current\noffers like the family plan for new users. The company stopped\noffering an unlimited data plan last year. Existing customers\ncan keep their current plans, said  Brenda Raney , a spokeswoman\nfor the  Basking Ridge , New Jersey-based company.  Old Versus New  For a  comparable package  under Verizon\u2019s old plan, a user\ncould combine a monthly $30 2-gigabyte data allotment, a $40\ncalling plan and a $20 unlimited text messaging charge for a\ntotal of $90. Families could add additional members for $10 a\nmonth. Each new family member had to buy a separate data\nallotment.  Under the new offer, Verizon Wireless, co-owned by  Verizon\nCommunications Inc. (VZ)  and  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , will charge $40 a\nmonth for smartphones, $30 a month for basic phones and $10 a\nmonth for tablets. On top of that there are six data-service\nplans starting at 1 gigabyte for $50, 2 gigabytes for $60, 4\ngigabytes for $70 and as many as 10 gigabytes for $100.  \u201cIt is an effort to move ARPU up,\u201d said Walt Piecyk, an\nanalyst with BTIG LLC in New York, referring to average revenue\nper user, a measure of how much each customer spends each month.  As smartphones gain popularity, consumers have become less\ninterested in paying for calling plans and are finding free\nalternatives to text messaging, Piecyk said. By making voice and\ntexts unlimited, Verizon eliminates the cheaper plans and turns\nthe price emphasis toward tiered data allotments for multiple\ndevices. The new offers also include hot-spot service that can\nshare the data connection with other devices over Wi-Fi.  AT&T\u2019s Goal  By charging a monthly fee per device and eliminating the\ncheapest prices such as a $10-a-month entry level for family\nmembers and $10 text messaging, Verizon Wireless\u2019s new plan is\nnot a bargain for budget shoppers, Piecyk said. The trade-off is\nthat big consumers of services like videos on  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s\nYouTube and  Pandora Media Inc. (P)  streaming radio can soon share\nbig buckets of Internet data.  With the new shared data plans, Verizon can \u201cprovide\nsavings at higher ARPUs, which is where Verizon wants to move\ntheir customers,\u201d Piecyk said.  AT&T plans to roll out an equivalent offer in 2012.  \u201cWe\u2019ll have something later this year,\u201d said Ralph de la Vega, president of the Dallas-based company\u2019s mobility division,\nin an interview last month.  Verizon Communications gained 0.9 percent to $42.94 at the\nclose in New York. AT&T rose 1.1 percent to $34.98.
