 "context": "The following article called 'Euro Trades Near Seven-Week Low on Concern Ireland Debt Crisis May Spread' was published on 2010-11-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe euro traded near a seven-week\nlow against the dollar amid concern a failure to craft a rescue\npackage for Ireland will allow the nation\u2019s banking crisis to\nspread to other member states of the common currency.  The dollar rose versus the yen for a seventh straight day,\nmarking a six-week high and the longest run of gains since 1995.\nThe Australian and New Zealand dollars traded near the lowest\nlevels in more than two weeks as declines in stocks and concern\nthat China will take measures to cool inflation damped demand\nfor higher-yielding assets.  \u201cConcerns about the region\u2019s debt crisis weigh on the\neuro,\u201d said  Jeremy Stretch , executive director of foreign-\nexchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in\nLondon. \u201cThat\u2019s given the dollar a boost, and the euro stays\nunder pressure. Ireland\u2019s problem is not so much a sovereign\nissue as a banking issue.\u201d  The euro was at $1.3487 as of 8:01 a.m. in London from\n$1.3489 in New York yesterday, when it touched $1.3448, the\nweakest level since Sept. 28. The shared currency traded at\n112.55 yen from 112.38 yen after dropping 0.4 percent yesterday.\nThe greenback fetched 83.43 yen from 83.29 yen. Yesterday, it\nreached 83.59 yen, the highest level since Oct. 5.  \u201cThe rebound in the dollar is beneficial for the Japanese\neconomy,\u201d Stretch said. \u201cDollar-yen is squeezing up and that\nwill help alleviate some of the nation\u2019s export pressures.\u201d  EU, IMF Talks  Ireland is negotiating with the European Union and\nInternational Monetary Fund about aid to shore up the state\u2019s\nfinances, furnish capital for the country\u2019s banks and spare the\nnation from tapping the bond market for an extended period, a\nEuropean official said on condition of anonymity.  European finance ministers started work on possible aid for\nIreland\u2019s  debt-laden banks , stopping short of an immediate\nbailout package. Finance chiefs from the 16-country euro region\nlauded Ireland\u2019s budget cuts, echoing the rhetorical support\noffered in the early stages of Greece\u2019s debt trauma before a\nrescue became necessary. Ireland said it doesn\u2019t need EU money.  Irish Prime Minister  Brian Cowen  told Parliament in Dublin\nthe nation hasn\u2019t lodged an aid request and the goal is \u201ca\ncredible, efficient and above all workable solution that will\nprovide assurance to the markets.\u201d  Dollar \u2018Bias\u2019  \u201cInvestors are poised to unwind their positions rather\nthan adding new ones amid Europe\u2019s lingering issues, and the\nbias is for the dollar to be bought,\u201d said  Kuniyuki Hirai ,\nmanager of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi\nUFJ Ltd., a unit of Japan\u2019s largest lender. \u201cThe euro will\nstruggle to rise toward year-end.\u201d  Austrian Finance Minister  Josef Proell  said he\u2019s\nconsidering withholding his country\u2019s share of the next part of\nGreece\u2019s 110 billion-euro ($148 billion) rescue, saying the\nAthens government missed a revenue-raising target. Greece\u2019s\nnear-default in May triggered Europe\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis.  The euro has lost 7.4 percent this year against its\ndeveloped-nation counterparts, Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted\nCurrency Indexes show. The dollar is down 1 percent, while the\nyen has gained 12 percent, the indexes show.  The dollar was supported as Atlanta Federal Reserve\nPresident Dennis Lockhart said additional bond purchases by the\ncentral bank aren\u2019t intended to weaken the greenback.  Fed Outlook  Lockhart said the program to buy $600 billion in Treasuries\nis not intended to weaken the dollar or monetize the debt. The\neffect of the policy would be \u201cmeasured,\u201d Lockhart said in\nremarks prepared for a speech in Montgomery, Alabama.  The Fed announced on Nov. 3 it would make the bond\npurchases, a program known as quantitative easing, through June.\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren is set to speak at a chamber\nof commerce breakfast in Providence, R.I., and St. Louis Fed\nPresident James Bullard will speak in St. Louis today.  The dollar\u2019s gains may be limited as reports today are\nforecast to show U.S. inflation was contained and housing starts\ndropped to a three-month low.  \u201cEmployment and housing haven\u2019t recovered much at all,\u201d\nsaid  Tetsuya Inoue , chief researcher for financial markets at\nNomura Research Institute in Tokyo, a unit of Japan\u2019s largest\nbrokerage. \u201cWeak credit conditions in the U.S. may prompt\npeople to invest money abroad. As a result, the dollar will be\nunder downward pressure.\u201d  Inflation, Housing  U.S. consumer prices, excluding food and fuel costs, rose\n0.7 percent in October from a year ago after gaining 0.8 percent\nin September, according to the median estimate of economists in\na Bloomberg News survey before today\u2019s data. Housing starts grew\nat a 598,000 annual rate last month, the least since July and\ndown from a 610,000 rate in September, another survey showed.  The euro gained against the yen as the common currency\nclimbed above the so-called cloud of the daily ichimoku chart\nafter entering it yesterday.  Ichimoku analysis, developed by a Japanese journalist, is\nused to predict a currency\u2019s direction through analyzing the\nmidpoints of historical highs and lows.  Australia\u2019s currency touched 97.25 U.S. cents yesterday,\nthe weakest since Oct. 29, after Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said\nthe cabinet is drafting steps to counter excessive price gains.  \u201cThe Aussie dollar has been directly affected by the\nmovement we\u2019ve seen in risk appetite because of China tightening\nconcerns and news from the euro zone,\u201d said Ray Attrill, head\nof macro strategy in Sydney at Tallship Investments, a currency\nfund manager.  Australia\u2019s currency traded at 97.38 U.S. cents from 97.67\ncents. New Zealand\u2019s dollar was at 76.41 cents from 76.78 cents.\nThe so-called kiwi reached 76.39 cents earlier today, the lowest\nsince Nov. 2.
