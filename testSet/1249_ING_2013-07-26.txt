The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBelgacom SA (BELG) , the largest telephone\ncompany in Belgium, climbed the most in Brussels trading since\ngoing public in 2004 as better-than-estimated earnings\nalleviated concern about a possible dividend cut.  Belgacom jumped 9.1 percent to 18.335 euros on Euronext\nBrussels, the biggest gain since it  first  sold shares in March\n2004. The shares had lost 24 percent this year through\nyesterday, the  worst performance  among the 23 companies in the\nStoxx 600 Telecommunications Index, as investors speculated that\nBelgacom would have to reduce its payouts amid mounting mobile\ncompetition in Belgium.  Chief Executive Officer Didier Bellens switched Belgacom\u2019s\nfocus to mobile customer wins in the past quarter using handset\nsubsidies and a simplified offer of lower-priced rate plans,\nbacked by price increases for bundled fixed-line products and\ndirect sales through the company\u2019s own website. Belgacom added\n128,000 postpaid clients in the three months through June,\nhalting the erosion of its mobile-customer base, and maintained\nits  forecast  for a drop of as much as 6 percent in earnings\nbefore interest, tax, depreciation and amortization this year.  \u201cThe fact that Belgacom reiterates its guidance might give\ninvestors hope that the 2013  dividend  will amount to 2.18 euros\na share,\u201d Emmanuel Carlier, an analyst at ING Bank NV in\nBrussels, wrote in an investor note. \u201cFree cash flow will\nremain under pressure in the coming years, suggesting a dividend\ncut is merely a question of time.\u201d  Mobile Prices  Second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation\nand amortization of 430 million euros ($572 million)  surpassed \nthe 414.2 million-euro average of 12 analyst estimates compiled\nby Bloomberg. Revenue fell 2.5 percent on a like-for-like basis,\nworsening from a 0.8 percent drop in the preceding quarter amid\nlower mobile prices.  Mobistar,  Belgium \u2019s second-largest mobile-phone operator,\nlowered its forecasts and suspended its dividend earlier this\nweek to retain cash for network investments after customer\nlosses continued and lower-priced rate plans took a larger hit\non service revenue than analysts had estimated.  Belgacom generated 371 million euros of cash from\noperations less capital spending before changes in working\ncapital in the first half, a 4.9 percent drop from the same\nperiod a year earlier.  Free cash flow, which also incorporates changes in\ninventories, accounts receivable and accounts payable, tumbled\n53 percent to 136 million euros in the same period because of\ntiming differences in income tax payments.
