The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFebruary 8, 2018 / 12:31 PM / in 5 minutes CVS pledges to reinvest much of its tax savings, shares fall Nandita Bose , Bill Berkrot 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp ( CVS.N ) warned on Thursday that its operating profit could fall this year as it plans to spend most of its $1.2 billion savings from the new U.S. tax law on reducing debt and paying employees more rather than boosting short-term profit. \nShares of the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager fell almost 3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. \nCVS, which is in the process of buying health insurer Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) for $69 billion, said it now expects full-year adjusted consolidated operating profit to range from an increase of 1.5 percent over last year to a decline of 1.5 percent. That is more pessimistic that its previous estimate of growth ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. \n\u201cThe disappointment here is that much of the tax reform benefit on earnings is essentially going away, so near-term it\u2019s not going to provide as much lift to earnings as people were modeling,\u201d said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Mohan Naidu. \nUsing its tax savings, CVS said it will invest $425 million annually to raise its minimum wage for hourly employees to $11 an hour and offer a paid parental leave program. It also said it will spend at least half of its tax windfall on debt reduction and allocate at least $275 million to strategic investments in its business. \nThe raise for employees follows similar actions by Humana Inc ( HUM.N ) and Walmart Inc ( WMT.N ) to attract workers at a time when a historically low U.S. unemployment rate is making it harder to find and retain minimum-wage workers.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \n\u201cWith $1.2 billion in cash benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we will be able to make strategic investments in our business in 2018 to stimulate greater growth over the longer term,\u201d Chief Financial Officer David Denton said in a statement. \nShareholders may have been looking for CVS to use tax savings to return cash to them through share buybacks or increased dividends as some other companies have recently pledged. \nCVS shares fell as much as 3.6 percent before paring some of those losses and were down $2.09, or 2.8 percent at $72.26. \nThe company said it expected adjusted operating profit growth of 0.5 percent to 4.5 percent in the first quarter as it benefits from a bad flu season. \nIn January, the company projected a tax rate of about 27 percent this year versus 39 percent previously. \nExcluding items, CVS reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of $1.92 per share, beating analysts\u2019 average expectations by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
