 "context": "The following article called 'Neuberger Reprises Lehman Team for Hedge-Fund Deals' was published on 2010-07-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNeuberger Berman Group LLC, the\nmoney manager that was part of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,\nreassembled a team of executives to invest as much as $1 billion\nin firms that run hedge funds.  \n The investments will be made through a new private-equity\nfund, Dyal Capital Partners LP, the New York-based firm said in\na regulatory filing. Dyal is led by Michael Rees, chief operating\nofficer of Neuberger\u2019s alternative-investments business, who\n</a>worked in the Lehman unit that bought stakes in hedge-fund\nmanagers including D.E. Shaw Group and Ospraie Management LLC.  \n The U.S. financial-overhaul legislation approved yesterday\nby Congress may limit the ability of banks and brokerages to\ninvest in hedge-fund advisers. That would make funds like\nNeuberger\u2019s more attractive to hedge-fund principals looking for\ncapital, according to  Aaron Dorr , a managing director in the\nfinancial institutions group at Jefferies & Co., a New York-\nbased securities firm.  \n \u201cAt a minimum, there may be less competition for these\nassets if the banks are not buyers,\u201d Dorr said in a telephone\ninterview.  \n Randall Whitestone , a spokesman for Neuberger, a 71-year-\nold money-management firm that Lehman purchased in 2003,\ndeclined to comment. Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy\nprotection in September 2008, issued a majority stake in\nNeuberger to the unit\u2019s employees last year in return for\ncontractual guarantees that they would remain in their jobs.  \n Hedge-fund firms, which oversee $1.7 trillion globally,\nusually charge management fees of 2 percent of assets and\nperformance fees equal to 20 percent of investment gains.  \n Sharing Revenue  \n Dyal will invest in 12 to 15 established hedge-fund firms\nwith assets ranging from $1 billion to $6 billion, according to\na person with knowledge of the matter. Dyal\u2019s share of fee\nincome will be distributed to its investors, providing an annual\nyield that could exceed 25 percent, said the person, who asked\nnot to be identified because the fund is private.  \n Private-equity firms including TPG Inc. and  KKR & Co.  have\nbought or invested in asset managers, focusing mostly on mutual\nfunds because they generate more predictable fees than hedge\nfunds.  \n \u201cHedge funds are challenging to value for starters because\nthey have such a huge proportion of their revenues from\nperformance fees, which are volatile,\u201d said  Michael Wilson , a\nmanaging director in the financial-services group at TA\nAssociates, a Boston-based private-equity firm that has made 13\ninvestments in asset managers since 1989. \u201cThe other thing is\nhedge funds tend to be run by big personalities with big egos,\nand they like their independence.\u201d  \n Cantilever Capital  \n David Ballard , the former co-head of convertible-bond\norigination at Merrill Lynch & Co., plans a fund called\nCantilever Capital LLC that will also raise capital to invest in\nmoney managers, according to a June 8 filing with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. Cantilever, based in\nNorwalk, Connecticut, will acquire stakes of as much as 25\npercent in managers through the purchase of convertible-debt\nsecurities that mature in 20 years.  \n Ballard declined to comment on the filing, which said that\nthe convertible notes acquired by Cantilever will have a\n\u201cparticipation-based\u201d payment structure that is based on the\nrevenue of the underlying money manager or its assets under\nmanagement.  \n \u201cThe notes will not be actively or publicly traded,\u201d the\nfiling said, adding that Cantilever will buy the securities \u201cin\nhighly negotiated \u2018one-off\u2019 private transactions.\u201d  \n Past Deals  \n Prior to its bankruptcy, Lehman invested about $2 billion\nin hedge-fund firms including D.E. Shaw, founded by  David E. Shaw , and  Dwight Anderson \u2019s Ospraie. The New York-based bank\nalso acquired minority stakes in money managers including\nSpinnaker Capital Group of London; Marble Bar Asset Management\nLLP, a London-based firm founded by Hilton Nathanson; and GLG\nPartners Inc., a New York firm that is now publicly traded.  \n Rees helped select many of these investments while at\nLehman. He\u2019s joined at Dyal by Andrew Komaroff, Neuberger\u2019s\nchief operating officer;  George Walker , the firm\u2019s chief\nexecutive officer; and  Anthony Tutrone , head of alternative\ninvestments. All worked together on the Lehman team.  \n Neuberger had raised $150 million for the fund, according\nto its filing with the SEC last month. The minimum investment is\n$10 million for Dyal, which will focus on investing in firms\nthat can attract money from large pension funds, according to\nthe person familiar with the partnership.  \n Market Opening  \n Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse\nGroup AG have units or funds that invest in hedge-fund managers.\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s $1 billion Petershill Fund LP, run by  Jonathan Sorrell , has reported buying stakes in Winton Capital Management\nand Capula Investment Management LLP, both based in London.  \n The financial-services overhaul bill could prevent banks\nand brokerages from making minority investments in outside\nadvisers, according to  Kevin Petrasic , an attorney in the\nWashington office of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP.  \n \u201cThis is one of those provisions where the devil is in the\ndetails of how the regulators apply that rule,\u201d Petrasic said\nin an interview. \u201cThe regulators will take a close look at this\nissue\u201d of whether banks can make minority investments in\noutside managers.  \n Sovereign wealth funds of countries such as China and Dubai\ntook minority stakes in hedge-fund managers that went public in\n2006 and 2007, only to suffer big losses during the market crash\nthat they have yet to recoup. Dubai International Capital LLC\npaid about $1.2 billion to acquire a 10.8 percent stake in Och-\nZiff Capital Management Group LLC in November 2007. The stake\u2019s\ncurrent market value is about $511 million.  \n \u201cThe ground is littered with the wreckage of these\nminority-stake ventures, in part because talent is far, far\nrarer than capital,\u201d said  Donald Putnam , a managing partner for\nGrail Partners LLC, whose $100 million Chalice Fund LP has\ninvested in money managers such as Creighton Capital Management\nLLC of Sausalito, California, and Munder Capital Management in\nBirmingham, Michigan. \u201cAdverse selection is rampant.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Miles Weiss  in Washington at \n mweiss@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     D.E.
