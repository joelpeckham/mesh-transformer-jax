 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Stocks Fall Amid Europe Downgrade Concern as JPMorgan Drops' was published on 2012-01-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. stocks retreated, snapping a\nfour-day rally for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index, as euro-\nregion governments braced for credit downgrades by S&P and after\n JPMorgan Chase & Co. \u2019s profit slumped 23 percent.  After the market close, S&P said  France  was downgraded,\nwhile  Germany  had its  credit rating  affirmed. All 10 groups in\nthe S&P 500 fell as financial, industrial and technology\nmeasures declined at least 0.7 percent. JPMorgan, the largest\nU.S.  bank  by assets, dropped 2.5 percent.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,\n Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  lost more than 1.3 percent.  Eastman\nKodak Co. (EK)  tumbled 23 percent as it is said to be in talks with\n Citigroup Inc. (C)  to provide bankruptcy financing.  The S&P 500 slid 0.5 percent to 1,289.09 as of 4 p.m.  New\nYork  time, paring a drop of as much as 1.4 percent. The  Dow\nJones Industrial Average  slid 48.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to\n12,422.06. The market will be closed on Jan. 16 for a holiday.  \u201cPeople are keeping a very careful eye on Europe and they\nare nervous with earnings,\u201d  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage $23.4\nbillion at Security Global Investors in Irvington, New York,\nsaid in a telephone interview. \u201cMost people expected France to\nbe downgraded. It\u2019s critical that any downgrades in Europe do\nnot involve Germany,\u201d he said. In the U.S.,  \u201cJPMorgan (JPM) \u2019s\nearnings were OK, but the  quality  is not good.\u201d  Germany, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and\nthe Netherlands had their ratings affirmed by S&P as France lost\nits AAA rating. France was cut to AA+ and the rating has a\nnegative outlook, S&P said in a statement. Cyprus, Italy,\nPortugal and Spain were cut by two notches S&P said. The long-\nterm ratings on Austria, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia were cut\none notch.  \u2018Size and Scope\u2019  European leaders\u2019 attempts to address economic woes hasn\u2019t\n\u201cproduced a breakthrough of sufficient size and scope to fully\naddress the Eurozone\u2019s financial problems,\u201d S&P said. The\nregion continues to face tightening credit conditions among\nother problems, S&P said.  Concern about potential downgrades overshadowed data\nshowing that confidence among U.S. consumers rose more than\nforecast in January to the highest level in eight months, a sign\nhousehold spending may hold up early this year. Separate figures\nshowed that the U.S.  trade deficit  widened more than forecast in\nNovember as American exports declined and companies stepped up\nimports of crude oil and automobiles.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.9 percent since Jan. 6, capping the\nsecond straight  week  of gains, amid lower borrowing costs at\nauctions in Europe. Investors also watched fourth-quarter\nresults.  S&P 500  companies, which beat estimates in the previous\n11 quarters, are forecast to report a 4.6 percent increase in\nper-share profit during the September-December period, according\nto projections compiled by Bloomberg.  On the Sidelines  Financial companies slumped 0.8 percent, the most among 10\ngroups in the S&P 500. JPMorgan dropped 2.5 percent to $35.92.\nInvestment-banking revenue declined 30 percent to $4.36 billion\nfrom a year earlier as many clients stayed on the sidelines on\nconcern the European debt crisis would lead to a global economic\nslowdown.  \u201cFinancials would have to participate for the market to do\nwell,\u201d James Dunigan, who helps oversee $104 billion as chief\ninvestment officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management,\nsaid in a telephone interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll look to see whether all\nthat disruption in Europe had an effect in overall earnings\nreports. If that bleeds over into our export numbers, it may\nhave an impact on the earnings side.\u201d  Banks Tumble  Bank of America  lost 2.7 percent to $6.61, while  Morgan\nStanley (MS)  retreated 3.2 percent to $16.63. Citigroup fell 2.7\npercent to $30.74. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. slid 2.2 percent to\n$98.96.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index retreated 1.1 percent\namid concern about global economic growth. The Dow Jones\nTransportation Average dropped 0.6 percent. Intel, the world\u2019s\nbiggest chipmaker, declined 2.4 percent to $25.14. Alcoa slumped\n1.3 percent to $9.80.  Kodak tumbled 23 percent to 52 cents. The imaging company\nmay seek protection from  creditors  within weeks and then hold an\nauction to sell its patent portfolio, said three people familiar\nwith the matter, who asked not to be identified because the\ntalks are private. Kodak may seek about $1 billion in so-called\ndebtor-in-possession financing, though terms may change, two\npeople said.  Weaker Coal Market  Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX)  declined 13 percent to $7.87. The U.S.\nmining company said it will idle production in West Virginia\nbecause of a weaker market for coal used by steelmakers. Other\ncoal producers fell. Alpha Natural Resources Inc. dropped 10\npercent, the most in the S&P 500, to $20.19.  Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) \nretreated 9.8 percent to $14.13.  Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW)  lost 2.5 percent to $12.16. The\nindependent, San Francisco-based brokerage was downgraded to\n\u201cmarket perform\u201d from \u201coutperform\u201d at Wells Fargo & Co.  BankUnited Inc (BKU) . rallied 5.8 percent to $24.48 as it is\nexploring a sale one year after its private-equity owners took\nthe lender public, according to a person with knowledge of the\nmatter. BankUnited is working with  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,\nsaid the person, who declined to be identified because the\ndiscussions are private. The company could still decide against\na sale.  Stock investors shouldn\u2019t get used to the relative calm\nthat markets are now showing, according to  Andrew Garthwaite , a\nglobal equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.  \u2018Abnormally Sensitive\u2019  Volatility is likely to rise this year, Garthwaite wrote\nyesterday in a report. He attributed the outlook to excessive\nborrowing in developed economies, which ensures that investors\nwill be \u201cabnormally sensitive\u201d to shifts in economic growth\nand government policy, he added.  \u201cSentiment in the market has clearly changed over the past\nthree months,\u201d wrote Garthwaite, who is based in  London .  Even so, developed-country debt is still $8 trillion too\nhigh, the report said. Garthwaite came up with that estimate by\ncomparing the borrowing relative to gross domestic product with\na figure based on the debt-to-GDP ratio\u2019s trend during the past\nthree decades.  The need to reduce this burden creates \u201ca considerable\namount of tail risk,\u201d or potential for unlikely stock-market\noutcomes, the report said. He mentioned 11 possible surprises\nfor this year. One was a breakup of the euro region, which he\nestimated would send the  S&P 500  falling to 800, or 38 percent\nless than yesterday\u2019s close.
