 "context": "The following article called 'Bernanke Lowers His Own Home Loan Rate by 1.1 Point' was published on 2012-09-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFederal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  refinanced his mortgage last year, cutting the rate on\na 30-year home loan to 4.25 percent from 5.375 percent, his\nfinancial disclosure form shows.  Like millions of Americans, Bernanke benefited from a bond\npurchase program by the Fed known as quantitative easing, which\nhelped push down rates on home loans to record lows. The central\nbank has bought a total of $2.3 trillion in bonds since 2008 to\nreduce borrowing costs and spur economic growth.  About 16.1 million U.S. homeowners have refinanced\nmortgages since April 2009, according to U.S. Department of\nHousing and Urban Development  data . The value of the Fed\nchairman\u2019s home loan ranges from $500,001 to $1 million,\naccording to his disclosure released today.  The average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage fell to a\nrecord 3.49 percent in July, according to  Freddie Mac . It was\n3.55 percent this week. The average 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo\nmortgage rate was  4.18 percent  yesterday, matching prior record\nlows in July and August, Bankrate.com surveys show. Mortgages in\nWashington for $625,500 and more are classified as jumbo loans.  Bernanke said his family-owned financial assets are valued\nbetween $1.07 million and $2.28 million. That compares with a\nrange of $1.06 million to $2.31 million in last year\u2019s\ndisclosure, and $1.15 million to $2.48 million for 2009. The\nforms from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics require\nofficials to report only a range in the value of holdings.  European Crisis  The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index was little changed last\nyear and has rallied 14 percent  in 2012  as the Fed pledged to\nstrengthen the  U.S. economy  and European leaders tried to stem\ncontagion from the region\u2019s debt crisis. The central bank\nreduced its key interest rate to almost zero in December 2008\nand has since engaged in two rounds of large-scale asset\npurchases totaling $2.3 trillion.  Large-scale asset purchases \u201cappear to have boosted stock\nprices, presumably both by lowering discount rates and by\nimproving the economic outlook,\u201d Bernanke said last week at the\nKansas City Fed\u2019s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Bernanke, a former Princeton University professor, listed\nretirement accounts, TIAA Traditional and CREF Stock Large Cap\nBlend, as his two largest assets. Both were valued in a range of\n$500,001 to $1 million, the same as the past two years. TIAA-\nCREF is a New York-based financial services firm that offers\nretirement accounts for academic and government workers.  Royalties from one textbook accounted for $50,001 to\n$100,000 in income last year, while a second book brought in\n$100,001 to $1 million, according to Bernanke\u2019s form.  Bernanke Salary  Bernanke earns a salary of $199,700, an amount  set  by\nCongress. The Fed chief was appointed by President  George W. Bush  to succeed  Alan Greenspan  as chairman in 2006 and was re-\nnominated for a second four-year term in 2010 by President\nBarack Obama.  Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  and her husband  George Akerlof ,\na Nobel laureate, held assets of between $3.4 million and $7.4\nmillion, her filing shows. The couple, who said they hold most\nof their assets in a trust, listed stocks including  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ,\n ConocoPhillips (COP) ,  OfficeMax Inc. (OMX)  and  Raytheon Co. (RTN)  They also have a\nstamp collection valued from $15,001 to $50,000.
