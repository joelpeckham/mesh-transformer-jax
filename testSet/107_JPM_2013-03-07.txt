The ECB kept its benchmark interest rate at a\nrecord low today and President Mario Draghi said data suggests\nthe economy will stabilize in the first half of this year.  \u201cThis is now two straight days we\u2019ve had a positive\nreading on the labor market and one of the big concerns in the\nmarket has been whether this is jobless prosperity and ergo can\nit continue?\u201d  Uri Landesman , president of New York-based hedge\nfund Platinum Partners, which manages about $1.2 billion, said\nby telephone. \u201cI\u2019m still skeptical but the data the last two\ndays would support the fact that it\u2019s not jobless prosperity,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cThe data\u2019s been strong and if the bulls are still in\ncontrol of the market, that should take us through resistance.\u201d  Dow Record  The Dow rose 0.3 percent yesterday to extend an all-time\nhigh as an ADP Research Institute report indicated faster-than-\nforecast growth in jobs and the Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book\nsaid the economy was growing.

Dollar Correlation  For the first time in four years the dollar is\nparticipating in a rally that has sent stocks higher as traders\nin the $4-trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market bet the world\u2019s\nlargest economy will only strengthen. That\u2019s unusual because the\ngreenback has tended to move in the opposite direction to\nequities in recent years as investors sought a haven from the\nglobal financial crisis, sovereign bailouts in  Europe  and slower\ngrowth.  \u201cThis is potentially a clear turning point for the U.S.\ndollar,\u201d said John Horner, a currency strategist in Sydney at\nDeutsche Bank AG, the world\u2019s top foreign-exchange trading firm\nas measured by Greenwich Associates. \u201cWe\u2019re now starting to get\ntoward the point where good U.S. data is good for the U.S.\ndollar and good for U.S. markets, and that\u2019s a quite different\nscenario to what we\u2019ve seen over the past few years.\u201d  Household Wealth  Household wealth in the U.S. climbed in the fourth quarter\nto the highest level in five years, propelled by a gain in home\nprices that is helping repair family finances.

Portugal \u2019s  10-year yield  fell 22 basis\npoints to 5.93 percent, also the least since January, after the\nnation\u2019s credit rating outlook was raised to stable from\nnegative by S&P, which said European lenders will probably\nextend support to the government and make the nation\u2019s fiscal\ntightening \u201cmore sustainable.\u201d  U.K. Easing  U.K. 10-year bond yields rose six basis points to 2.01\npercent while the pound slipped more than 1 percent against the\neuro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.

ECB President Mario Draghi stuck to his\nview that the euro region will gradually recover and said the\nbank\u2019s monetary policy \u201cwill remain accommodative for as long\nas needed.\u201d  \u2018Ongoing Contraction\u2019  The euro\u2019s rise is unsustainable as investment dwindles and\ncountries in southern Europe struggle to revive growth and\nreduce unemployment, saidJulian Callow, chief international\neconomist at Barclays Plc. The euro, which traded as strong as\n$1.3117 today, should be at $1.15, Callow said in an interview\non Bloomberg Radio\u2019s \u201cSurveillance\u201d with  Tom Keene  and Michael McKee.  \u201cWe\u2019re still in a significant fiscal contraction in the\neuro zone,\u201d Callow said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of deleveraging\nin the private sector if you look at the figures for bank\nlending, which is contracting very sharply still in southern\nEurope. That goes hand in hand with an ongoing contraction in\nthe investment cycle.\u201d  The euro-zone economy will shrink 0.3 percent in 2013,\nmarking the first back-to-back annual contraction since the\nsingle currency\u2019s birth in 1999, the European Commission\nforecast last month.
