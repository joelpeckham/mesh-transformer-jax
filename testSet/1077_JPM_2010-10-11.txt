 "context": "The following article called 'Petrobras Bondholders Gain as Shareholders Lose: Brazil Credit' was published on 2010-10-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBonds issued by Petroleo Brasileiro\nSA are outperforming Brazilian corporate and government\nsecurities on speculation last month\u2019s record $70 billion stock\noffering will allow the company to limit its debt sales.  The state-run oil producer\u2019s dollar bonds due in 2019\nreturned 2.9 percent since the Sept. 23 share sale, topping the\n2.1 percent gain on Brazilian corporate  notes  and 2.5 percent\nadvance in  government  securities, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg and JPMorgan Chase & Co. While the debt has rallied,\nthe  stock  sank 3 percent, lagging the 2.9 percent gain in the\n Bovespa  index, as the sale swelled the supply of the shares.  The stock offering will help fund a five-year, $224 billion\ninvestment plan that is the industry\u2019s largest, reducing the\nneed to issue debt, according to  Nick Robinson , who helps manage\n$26 billion in emerging-market shares at Aberdeen Asset\nManagement Inc. in Sao Paulo. Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-\nbased company is known, raised $27.5 billion in cash from the\nsale after paying the government $42.5 billion for the right to\ntap oil reserves.  \u201cFor the individual stock, there\u2019s still overhang from the\nsale,\u201d said  Fabio Spinola , who helps oversee $1 billion,\nincluding Petrobras shares, as equity strategist at Sao Paulo-\nbased hedge fund Quest Investimentos Ltda. \u201cFor credit, it\ncertainly is better than before the offering. The share sale\nhelps a lot.\u201d  Record Sales  Petrobras, Latin America\u2019s biggest energy company by market\nvalue, plans to raise $60 billion in bonds and loans over the\nnext five years to finance an investment program that seeks to\ndouble oil production, Chief Executive Officer  Jose Sergio Gabrielli  said Oct. 7.  \u201cNo oil company in the world would let this opportunity\npass by,\u201d Gabrielli told reporters in Rio de Janeiro.  The company didn\u2019t provide a breakdown of how much would\ncome from bonds and how much from loans.  Petrobras hasn\u2019t issued any bonds this year after selling\n$6.75 billion in international markets in 2009, more than the\n$5.55 billion it raised over the previous 10 years, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg.  The company\u2019s $2.75 billion of bonds due in 2019, which\nwere issued as part of last year\u2019s record sales, have gained 3.2\ncents on the dollar since the share offering to 125.7. They\ntouched a record 125.8 cents on Oct. 6.  Pemex Bonds  The yield declined 41 basis points, or 0.41 percentage\npoint, over that time to 4.22 percent, leaving it 89 basis\npoints above Brazilian government debt due in 2019. The gap has\ndropped from a one-month high of 104 basis points on Sept. 17.\nThe yield on similar-maturity bonds issued by Mexico\u2019s state-\ncontrolled oil company Petroleos Mexicanos fell 34 basis points\nsince Sept. 23 to 4.5 percent.  The rally in Petrobras bonds is a reversal of their\nunderperformance in the run-up to the share offering. The notes\ndue in 2019 returned 11 percent from the end of last year\nthrough Sept. 22, compared with 11.9 percent on Brazilian\ncorporate securities and 13 percent on government debt.  Standard & Poor\u2019s rates Petrobras  BBB- , the lowest\ninvestment-grade ranking and in line with Brazil\u2019s government.\nFitch Ratings Ltd. grades Petrobras one level higher than the\ngovernment at BBB while Moody\u2019s Investors Service rates the oil\nproducer two levels higher at Baa1.  \u2018Serial Issuer\u2019  Milena Zaniboni , an S&P analyst in Sao Paulo, said in an e-\nmailed response to questions that the five-year debt program was\nin line with its expectations when it affirmed Petrobras\u2019s\nranking the day of the share sale. Ana Ares, a Buenos Aires-\nbased analyst at Fitch, said on Oct. 8 that the company\u2019s\ninvestment plan may put its rating \u201ctoward the weaker end\u201d of\nthe category, echoing comments that her colleague  Daniel Kastholm  made in a Sept. 28 interview.  The investment program \u201cis aggressive and we know they\nneed funding for that,\u201d Ares said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cIt will be leveraging for the company.\u201d  Jack Deino , who oversees about $1.6 billion of emerging-\nmarket debt at Invesco Inc., said the outperformance in\nPetrobras bonds will likely fade.  \u201cI don\u2019t think the market is pricing in the reality that\nPetrobras is probably going to become a serial issuer,\u201d Deino\nsaid in a telephone interview from New York.  Petrobras said in an e-mailed statement that it doesn\u2019t\ncomment on market movements.  The extra yield investors demand to own Brazilian\ngovernment dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell six\nbasis points last week to 197, according to JPMorgan\u2019s EMBI+\nindex. The spread on emerging-market government dollar debt fell\nthree basis points to 271 as record-low yields on two-year\nTreasuries boosted demand for higher-yielding securities.  Default Swaps  The real fell 0.2 percent to 1.6699 per dollar at 5:10 p.m.\nNew York time. The yield on the overnight interest-rate futures\ncontract due in January 2012 fell two basis points to 11.41\npercent.  The cost of protecting Brazilian bonds against default for\nfive years was unchanged at 99, according to CMA DataVision.\nCredit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for\nthe underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a\ngovernment or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  Swaps on Petrobras bonds fell four basis points last week\nto 151, extending their decline to 11 since the share sale. The\ncontracts fell to 150 basis points today.  \u201cIf you have more equity, it helps to prevent a\ndowngrade,\u201d said  Diego Torres , head of emerging-market credit\nresearch at Munita, Cruzat y Claro, a Santiago-based financial\nservices company. \u201cThe rating companies aren\u2019t considering it\nbut the market was because of the aggressive investment plan. As\na bondholder, you come out in a better position in the capital\nstructure.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Veronica Navarro Espinosa  in New York at \n espinosa@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDavid Papadopoulos at \n papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 29.03582763671875 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
