 "context": "The following article called 'T. Rowe Price Profit Misses Estimates as Clients Redeem' was published on 2013-01-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nT. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW) , the asset\nmanager that has posted a profit every quarter since going\npublic in 1986, reported earnings that missed analysts\u2019\nestimates as clients pulled money for the first time in five\nquarters.  Net income in the fourth quarter increased 23 percent to\n$229.9 million, or 88 cents a share, the Baltimore-based company\nsaid today in a statement. Profit missed the 89 cents-a-share\naverage estimate of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg survey after\ncustomers withdrew $4.2 billion in the quarter.  \u201cThese results are somewhat weak,\u201d James Shanahan, an\nequity analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis , said in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cOutflows are relatively rare for T. Rowe\nand for it to happen now is a surprise.\u201d  Chief Executive Officer James Kennedy said in an interview\nthat redemptions from mutual funds were \u201cheavily loaded in\nDecember\u201d when investors were waiting for political leaders to\nstrike a budget deal. Clients returned to stock funds this\nmonth, said Kennedy, who has relied on popular retirement-\noriented products and strong performance among active fund\nmanagers to attract customers.  T. Rowe fell 0.8 percent to close at $71.61 in  New York .\nThe shares had risen 21 percent in the past year through\nyesterday, compared with the 30 percent gain for Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 20-company  index  of asset managers and custody banks.  Equity Shift  With about three-quarters of its assets in equities, T.\nRowe has increased the money it oversees for four straight years\neven as U.S. mutual-fund investors have shunned stocks for\nbonds. U.S. stock mutual funds got net deposits for the second\nstraight week in January as investors started to shift into\nequities, according to the  Investment Company Institute .  \u201cIn January, people have moved back into equities. It\u2019s\ntrue for the industry and it\u2019s true for us,\u201d Kennedy said.  Institutional withdrawals were concentrated in products\nthat invest outside the U.S., he said.  T. Rowe\u2019s assets rose 18 percent in 2012 to $576.8 billion,\nhelped by a 13 percent gain by global stocks as measured by the\nMSCI AC World Index. Customer withdrawals in the fourth quarter\nincluded about $400 million from mutual funds and $3.8 billion\nfrom institutional and other accounts.  Investors withdrew $1.4 billion from stock and blended\nmutual funds in the quarter while depositing $1 billion into\nbond and money-market funds. T. Rowe last had net withdrawals in\nthe third quarter of 2011 and has recorded only four quarters of\nredemptions since 2000, Kennedy said.  Assets Rise  The increase in assets helped boost revenue 17 percent to\n$787.3 million, driven by a 19 percent jump in investment\nadvisory fees. Revenue growth outpaced the 13 percent increase\nin expenses to $426.1 million.  Kennedy said the  U.S. economy  appears poised for stronger\ngrowth, with the automobile industry and housing gathering\n\u201creasonable momentum.\u201d U.S. politicians agreed in January to\nraise taxes and delayed the imposition of automatic spending\ncuts while they seek a longer-term budget agreement.  \u201cAll we need is a little confidence and some decision\nmaking coming out of  Washington ,\u201d Kennedy said.  T. Rowe mutual funds outperformed 74 percent of their peers\nin 2012, 78 percent over the past three years and 84 percent\nover five years, based on data compiled by Lipper, the company\nsaid.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world\u2019s largest asset manager, said\nJan. 17 its fourth-quarter net income rose 24 percent as the New\nYork-based company attracted $47 billion in net deposits.\nDenver-based  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS)  said Jan. 23 fourth-\nquarter net income fell 13 percent as clients withdrew $3.5\nbillion and poor performance reduced fees.  David Giroux, manager of the $13.8 billion T. Rowe Price\nCapital Appreciation Fund, was named research firm  Morningstar\nInc. (MORN) \u2019s fund manager of the year in the allocation category. The\nfund returned 15 percent in 2012.
