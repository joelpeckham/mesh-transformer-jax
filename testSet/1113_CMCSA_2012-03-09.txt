 "context": "The following article called 'Disney Board Nominees Opposed by Glass Lewis Over Executive Compensation' was published on 2012-03-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nProxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co. is\nopposing five nominees to the board of  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , citing\ndeficient links between performance and executive pay, and one\ndirector\u2019s ties to a failed lender.  Four of the nominees served on the TV, theme-park and film\ncompany\u2019s compensation committee, Glass Lewis said in a report.\nThe fifth nominee served on the board of a bank that was seized\nby regulators in 2008, resulting in losses for the investors.  The firm joins proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder\nServices Inc. and Connecticut Treasurer Denise L. Nappier in\nopposing Disney directors up for a vote at the March 13 annual\nmeeting in Kansas City, Missouri. Glass Lewis opposes half the\nnominees. A third proxy adviser, Egan-Jones Proxy Services,\nsupports the company\u2019s nominees and other issues on the ballot.  Much of the opposition relates to Disney\u2019s decision last\nyear to give Chief Executive Officer  Robert Iger  the additional\ntitle of chairman at the annual meeting. The company hasn\u2019t had\none executive in both positions since then-chief executive\n Michael Eisner  gave up the chairman title in 2004 under pressure\nfrom shareholder groups that said an independent chairman would\nlead to better shareholder stewardship.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 0.5 percent to\n$42.24 at the close in  New York . The stock has gained 13 percent\nthis year.  Glass Lewis prefers companies split the jobs of chairman\nand chief executive or have a lead director who isn\u2019t an\nexecutive of the company, the firm said in the Feb. 23 report.  While Disney said it will appoint an independent lead\ndirector, the company doesn\u2019t appear to have done so and Glass\nLewis said it is monitoring the issue.  Planned Transition  The decision to combine the positions was part of a\ntransition plan that was carefully thought out by the board,\nretiring Chairman John Pepper said in a statement March 7.  \u201cNine out of the ten directors will be independent,\nincluding an independent lead director with duties and\nresponsibilities that exceed in scope those recommended by\ngovernance advisers,\u201d Pepper said.  Of the 100 biggest  Standard & Poor\u2019s  companies, 68 percent\nhave a joint chairman and CEO, Pepper said. In a filing last\nweek, the company cited better long-term stock performance than\npeers such as  News Corp. (NWSA) ,  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ,  CBS\nCorp. (CBS)  and Viacom Inc.  Board View  \u201cThe Board rightfully considered Mr. Iger\u2019s performance\nover the course of his tenure when viewed in relation to the\nindustry peers against which both he and his compensation\npackage are most fairly measured,\u201d Disney said in the filing.\n\u201cOn that measure Mr. Iger\u2019s compensation is fully warranted.\u201d  In backing the nominees, Egan Jones said in its March 6\nreport the audit, compensation and governance-nominating\ncommittees were composed of independent, outside directors.  According to Glass Lewis, Disney overall paid more than its\npeers, while performing moderately worse. The adviser based its\nanalysis on 29 similarly sized companies, including four in\nconsumer products and six in movies and entertainment.  Glass Lewis  also cited the role of Orin Smith on the audit\nand governance committee of Washington Mutual when that lender\nwas seized by regulators in September 2008.
