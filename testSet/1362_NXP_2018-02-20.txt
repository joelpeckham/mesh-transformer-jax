 "context": "The following article called 'Qualcomm gets hedge fund nod with raised offer for NXP' was published on 2018-02-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n(Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc raised its offer to buy NXP Semiconductors NV to $127.50 per share on Tuesday, and said it has the backing of the shareholder group led by hedge fund Elliott Management that opposed its previous proposal.\nThe new deal puts pressure on fellow chipmaker Broadcom to decide if it will stick with a stipulation in its $121 billion bid for Qualcomm that the company not raise its previous $110 a share offer for NXP.\nIt also enables Qualcomm shareholders to better assess the standalone value of Qualcomm as they consider whether to back it in a shareholder vote on its fight with Broadcom on March 6.\n\u201cWe will see what (Broadcom) does now,\u201d Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said.\n\u201cWhile their current offer is \u2018premised\u2019 on NXP going at $110, they would of course not necessarily be precluded from making a new offer premised on the new NXP price.\u201d\nBroadcom said on Tuesday it was evaluating its options and that the revised price for NXP was well beyond what Qualcomm has repeatedly characterized as a \u201cfull and fair\u201d.\nThe new offer comes less than a week after Broadcom and Qualcomm executives met face-to-face to discuss the differences between the two sides. Neither company responded to requests for comment on Tuesday\u2019s offer.\nProxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Tuesday recommended Qualcomm shareholders vote for all six director nominees Broadcom has put forward. Last week, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc had recommended four Broadcom nominees.\nNXP\u2019s shares rose 6.1 percent to $125.73 on opening. The stock has traded above the original offer price for nearly seven months, reflecting expectations among investors that the offer would be raised.\nShares of Qualcomm were down 3.7 percent and those of Broadcom were up 1.5 percent.\nNEW TERMS The buyout of NXP will help Qualcomm, which provides chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple Inc, to expand in the fast-growing market for chips used in automobiles and reduce its dependence on a cooling smartphone market.\nUnder the new terms agreed with NXP\u2019s board, Qualcomm said it needs to buy a minimum 70 percent of NXP\u2019s outstanding shares in a tender offer, instead of the 80 percent required in the earlier agreement. The latest offer values NXP at $44 billion.\nIf Qualcomm does buy more than 70 percent in the tender offer, it can force the remaining shareholders to sell out without further negotiations.\nSan Diego-based Qualcomm agreed to buy Netherlands-based NXP for about $38 billion more than a year ago, but some NXP shareholders resisted a sale seeking a better price.\nQualcomm said on Tuesday it had entered into agreements with nine NXP stockholders, who collectively own more than 28 percent of NXP, including top shareholder Soroban Capital Partners LP and second-largest Elliott.\nActivist hedge fund Elliott, which had resisted Qualcomm\u2019s previous $110 per share offer saying it undervalued NXP, said it was pleased that NXP\u2019s value had been recognised in the revised transaction terms.\nQualcomm has also extended its tender offer for NXP until March 5, a day before the shareholder meeting, when Broadcom\u2019s slate of directors will also go to a vote.\nQualcomm, which plans to fund the additional $6 billion with cash on hand and new debt, said approval from China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce is the only regulatory nod remaining for the closure of the NXP deal.\nAdditional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York, writing by Supantha Mukherjee; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Patrick Graham\n \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Nuveen Select Tax Free Income Portfolio was 12.350905418395996 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Nuveen Select Tax Free Income Portfolio was ",
