The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGlobal markets are heading for an\n\u201cimportant turning point\u201d as interest rates begin to rise\nwithin about three months and the U.S. dollar gains, according\nto investor  Marc Faber .  Investors should buy stocks and sell cash and bonds because\ngovernments are continuing to print too much money and may\ncreate a new \u201ccredit bubble,\u201d Faber, publisher of the  Gloom,\nBoom & Doom  report, told reporters during a forum in Seoul today.  \u201cInstead of interest rates going down, they could start to\ngo up, instead of the dollar being weak, it could strengthen,\u201d\nFaber said. \u201cI\u2019m ultra-bearish on everything, but I believe\nyou\u2019ll be better off owning shares than government bonds.\u201d  The Dollar Index slid 8.5 percent last quarter, the most\nsince June 2002, and dropped 1.3 percent this month after\nFederal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled he may add\nmoney to the economy. That new supply is reflected in exchange\nrates, based on how the currency  reacted  to the last round of\nso-called quantitative easing, said HSBC Holdings Plc, BNP\nParibas SA and Nordea Bank AB. The central banks of Israel and\nTaiwan raised borrowing costs in the last 15 days.  Faber\u2019s recommendation on stocks is shared by  Warren Buffett , the billionaire chairman of Omaha, Nebraska-based\n Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  Investors buying bonds now \u201care making\na mistake,\u201d he said Oct. 5 at Fortune magazine\u2019s Most Powerful\nWomen conference in Washington.  Buffett, Stocks  \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that stocks are cheaper than bonds,\u201d\nBuffett said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone having bonds in their\nportfolio when they can own equities.\u201d  U.S.  stock dividends  are paying more than government bonds.\nTen-year Treasuries yield 5.2 percentage points less than\nequities of companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index when\nadjusted for annual inflation, near the most since March 2009.  Faber told investors to abandon U.S. stocks a week before\n1987\u2019s so-called Black Monday crash and said in August 2007 that\nU.S. shares were entering a bear market. The  S&P 500  peaked two\nmonths later before retreating as much as 57 percent.
