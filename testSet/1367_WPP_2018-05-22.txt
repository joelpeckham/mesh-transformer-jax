The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n0 COMMENTS Omnicom agency PHD has won the global HSBC Holdings HSBC 1.08% media buying account, according to people familiar with the matter, dealing another blow to rival WPP.\nThe review, which was conducted by consultant ID Comms on behalf of HSBC, came after the bank hired a new chief marketing officer, a move that often leads to a change in agency roster. Last year, HSBC hired Leanne Cutts, a former marketing executive from Mondelez, as its chief marketing officer.\nThe account has billings of about $400 million and is worth an estimated $20 million a year in revenue for WPP, according to a person familiar.\n\u201cWe have selected PHD as our preferred Media Planning and Buying Supplier as they demonstrated strong strategic skills and advanced digital transformation capabilities,\u201d said Ms. Cutts in a statement. \u201cIn a complex media and communications marketplace, PHD\u2019s overall approach stood out as being forward thinking, yet straightforward and pragmatic.\u201d\nWPP has long had a close relationship with HSBC. WPP\u2019s Mindshare has been handling the media account for over a decade, and JWT also handles some of HSBC\u2019s creative duties.\nMindshare\u2019s American Express business is also up for review. Sister agency Ogilvy recently lost its longtime American Express creative account to Dentsu-owned McGarryBowen.\nThe news is a setback for the world\u2019s largest ad holding company, which is currently also trying to keep its relationship with Ford, one of its largest and longest standing accounts that\u2019s now up for review .\nJust last month, WPP announced the abrupt exit of WPP CEO Martin Sorrell after an allegation of personal misconduct.\nWPP has had a particularly tough time over the past couple years. The company reported a slight decline in net sales in the most recent quarter . The firm also said it is forecasting no revenue growth this year, after having already cut its forecast three times. Account losses exacerbate the holding company\u2019s financial struggles and spook investors that are already wavering in their confidence in the ad holding company and its model.\nMr. Sorrell built WPP into an ad services giant through an aggressive acquisition strategy. For years, the agencies enjoyed longtime relationships with clients. But more recently, advertisers have come under pressure to cut back, and rethink their advertising models.\nMr. Sorrell\u2019s exit creates more confusion and chaos at a holding company that\u2019s already facing a number of challenges. WPP is currently conducting a search for his replacement.\nWhile WPP has lost a number of accounts in recent years, including ad giants AT&T and Volkswagen , the holding company is not alone in its turnover. The media buying sector has been mired in a prolonged tumultuous period in which many clients have reviewed their ad buying business relationships in an attempt to cut costs, adapt to a faster-paced digital environment and rebuild trust amid concerns around non-transparent media buying practices.\nDespite its recent challenges, WPP recently won some media business for Tesco .\nOmnicom referred calls to the client. WPP\u2019s GroupM, the ad-buying division that includes Mindshare, also didn\u2019t immediately respond.\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of WPP plc American Depositary Shares was 73.3908920288086 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of WPP plc American Depositary Shares was ",
