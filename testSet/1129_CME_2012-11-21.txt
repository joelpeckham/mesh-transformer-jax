The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCalifornia carbon allowances will\nsell for $14.06 each next year, down 2.7 percent from previous\nforecasts, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said after permits\ncleared in an auction near the lowest allowable price.  The  California Air Resources Board  sold all 23.1 million\ncarbon permits offered at a Nov. 14 auction for the first\ncompliance period of the state\u2019s emissions program starting Jan.\n1, the agency said on its website yesterday. The allowances\ncleared at $10.09, 9 cents above the $10 \u201cfloor price,\u201d or the\nlowest price allowed.  Power, oil and gas companies \u201cwere bidding for large\nvolumes near the auction floor price,\u201d Thomas Marcello, an\nanalyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance in  New York , said in an\ne-mailed research note. \u201cWe suspect that the clearing price was\nset by these relatively low-priced, large-volume bids.\u201d  Carbon futures dropped to a record low of $11.65 a ton\nyesterday after state regulators released the results of the\nauction, which created the world\u2019s second-biggest carbon market,\nafter the European Union program. California\u2019s system will\neventually cover 85 percent of emissions in an economy valued at\n$1.74 trillion last year.  Bloomberg New Energy Finance lowered its price forecasts\nfor contracts expiring this December, as well as December 2013,\n2014 and 2015. Those expiring this December will sell at $11.90,\ndown from the $12.67 that it projected on Nov. 8.  Lawsuit Filed  The California Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit Nov. 13\nchallenging the state\u2019s authority to sell permits, calling the\nallowance auction an unconstitutional fee.  \u201cCompliance entities may have considered the possibility\nthat the courts may eventually rule in favor of the plaintiff\u201d\nwhen deciding to buy permits in last week\u2019s auction, Marcello\nsaid. Companies would have to seek compensation for the\nallowances they bought in auction through the court system\nshould the sale be invalidated, he said.  Futures contracts based on carbon permits for December 2013\nexpiry climbed 5 cents to $11.70 a metric ton today, according\nto data compiled by  CME Group Inc. (CME) \u2019s Green Exchange in New York.\nPrices are down 26 percent for the year.  The state also sold 5.58 million out of the 39.5 million\nallowances it put up for auction to be used in the second phase\nof the program, beginning in 2015. The advance permits cleared\nat the $10 floor price.  Bloomberg New Energy Finance\u2019s previous forecasts assumed\nthat 25 percent of the advance allowances would go unsold as\nfuel distributors waited to begin stockpiling credits.
