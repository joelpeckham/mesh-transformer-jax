 "context": "The following article called 'Civitas Solutions Reports Fiscal 2018 Second Quarter Financial Results' was published on 2018-05-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Civitas Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: CIVI) today reported financial results for the fiscal second 2018.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 At A Glance\nSecond quarter net revenue increased 8.4% to $392.8 million Second quarter net loss was $2.5 million, compared to net income of $5.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA was $40.5 million, an increase of 2.9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017\n\u201cRevenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong volume growth from acquisitions in our I/DD, SRS and ADH service lines, as well as from higher average rates across all service lines,\u201d stated Bruce Nardella, president and chief executive officer. \u201cWe remain squarely focused on improving our operating performance and are encouraged by the progress we made this quarter to mitigate margin pressure created by increasing labor and healthcare costs.\n\u201cDuring the fiscal second quarter we identified for closure or consolidation several underperforming and non-strategic programs, while continuing our cost-containment initiatives,\u201d Nardella added. \u201cThe program closures and consolidations are important initiatives because, in addition to reducing expenses and improving margin, they will give management more time to focus on strategic, more productive programs and execute our growth strategy. We believe that these actions will strengthen our company and help us create long-term value for stockholders.\u201d\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nGAAP Results\nNet revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $392.8 million, an increase of $30.4 million, or 8.4%, over net revenue for the same period of the prior year. Net revenue increased $28.1 million from acquisitions that closed during and after the second quarter of the prior year and $2.3 million from organic growth. Net revenue growth was negatively impacted by a $1.6 million increase in sales adjustments compared to the second quarter of the prior year.\nNet revenue consisted of:\nIntellectual and Developmental Disabilities (\"I/DD\") services net revenue of $252.1 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Post-Acute Specialty Rehabilitation Services (\"SRS\") net revenue of $87.8 million, an increase of 13.7% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. At-risk youth (\"ARY\") services net revenue of $36.6 million, an increase of 2.6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adult Day Health (\"ADH\") services net revenue of $16.3 million, an increase of 35.8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIncome from operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $6.5 million, or 1.6% of net revenue, compared to $16.3 million, or 4.5% of net revenue, for the second quarter of the prior year. The majority of the decrease was due to $9.2 million of exit costs and other charges related to completed and planned program closures, primarily within our SRS and I/DD segments. These closures were identified through an ongoing comprehensive, top-to-bottom examination of each program's performance across all of our service lines. This comprehensive examination, which applied a higher program performance standard than in the past, is part of a larger, multi-year, multi-pronged effort to improve efficiency of our operations and mitigate margin erosion created by increasing labor and healthcare costs. In addition to these costs, our operating margin was negatively impacted by an increase in direct occupancy costs due to higher levels of open occupancy and an increase in rent expense, particularly in our SRS segment. Direct labor costs were relatively flat compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as the impact of increases in both overtime and health insurance expense were offset by a decrease in therapist and nursing consultant costs compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in our operating margin was partially offset by reductions in our employment practices liability and workers compensation expenses due to favorable claims experience, and a decrease in general and administrative expense due to our cost containment efforts and continued focus on optimizing our cost structure, as compared to the second quarter of the prior year.\nNet loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.5 million compared to net income of $5.5 million for the same period of the prior year. Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was due to the decrease in our income from operations described above.\nBasic and diluted net loss per common share was $0.07 for the fiscal second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to basic and diluted net income of $0.15 for the same period of the prior year.\nNon-GAAP Results\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $40.5 million, or 10.3% of net revenue, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $39.4 million, or 10.9% of net revenue, for the second quarter of the prior year. The decrease in our Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily attributable to the increase in direct occupancy costs described above. The decrease was partially offset by reductions in our employment practices liability and workers compensation expenses, and a decrease in general and administrative expense.\nAdjusted net income per diluted common share was $0.37 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $0.35 for the second quarter of the prior year.\nFirst Half Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nNet revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $788.2 million, an increase of $66.4 million, or 9.2%, over net revenue for the same period of the prior year. Net revenue increased $54.7 million for acquisitions that closed during and after the six months ended March 31, 2017 and $11.7 million from organic growth. Net revenue growth was negatively impacted by a $2.1 million increase in sales adjustments compared to the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet revenue consisted of:\nI/DD services net revenue of $507.9 million, an increase of 6.8% compared to the first half of fiscal 2017. SRS net revenue of $173.8 million, an increase of 14.7% compared to the first half of fiscal 2017. ARY service net revenue of $72.5 million, an increase of 1.5% compared to the first half of fiscal 2017. ADH services net revenue of $34.0 million, an increase of 47.0% compared to the first half of fiscal 2017.\nIncome from operations for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $19.3 million, or 2.4% of net revenue, compared to $31.7 million, or 4.4% of net revenue, for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in our operating margin was primarily due to $9.2 million of exit costs and other charges related to the closures described above, as well as increases in direct occupancy and direct labor costs compared to the six months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in occupancy costs was primarily due to higher levels of open occupancy and an increase in rent expense, particularly within our SRS segment. The increase in direct labor costs was primarily due to an increase in salary expense and overtime compared to the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $6.9 million compared to $9.7 million for the same period of the prior year. In addition to the factors impacting income from operations described above, net income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 included a $7.0 million tax benefit that was recorded in connection with revaluing of the Company\u2019s deferred tax liabilities as a result of the lower corporate tax rate established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) enacted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nBasic and diluted net income per common share was $0.18 for the six months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $0.26 for the same period of the prior year.\nNon-GAAP Results\nAdjusted EBITDA for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $78.5 million, or 10.0% of net revenue, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $77.0 million, or 10.7% of net revenue, for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in our Adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily attributable to the increases in direct occupancy and direct labor costs described above. The decrease was partially offset by lower general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue due to our cost containment efforts and continued focus on optimizing our cost structure.\nAdjusted net income per diluted common share was $0.70 for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.67 for the same period of the prior year.\nStock Repurchase Program\nOn February 8, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $25.0 million of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise (including, without limitation, the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans). The stock repurchase program will expire on August 12, 2018 or the date on which the total repurchase amount has been spent, whichever occurs first. We intend to conduct any open market stock repurchase activities in compliance with the safe harbor provisions of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 539,315 shares for $7.5 million under the plan which we have implemented through a 10b5-1 program.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook and Guidance\nThe Company is updating its fiscal 2018 net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance that it communicated on February 8, 2018 during the release of fiscal first quarter results.\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company is narrowing its net revenue guidance range and reducing the top-end of its Adjusted EBITDA guidance range. The Company now expects fiscal 2018 net revenue in the range of $1.58 billion to $1.61 billion and fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $168 million to $171 million. This compared to our previous ranges of $1.57 billion to $1.62 billion and $168 million to $173 million, respectively. The revised adjusted EBITDA range includes the full fiscal 2018 impact of investing $4 million to support employee recruitment and retention from a portion of the cash tax savings the Company is receiving under the Tax Act.\nA reconciliation of the low-end and high-end of the Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income is as follows:\nFiscal Year Ending September 30, 2018 (In millions) Low-end High-end Net income $ 18 $ 21 Provision for income taxes 3 3 Interest expense, net (a) 38 38 Depreciation and amortization 92 92 Stock-based compensation 8 8 Expense reduction project costs 2 2 Exit costs 6 6 Acquisition-related transaction costs 1 1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 168 $ 171 Modeling guidelines for the current fiscal year are as follows:\nAverage basic and diluted shares outstanding for the year: 37 million\nCapital expenditures: 3.3% of net revenue\nAnnual tax rate: 32% (b)\n(a) Interest expense, net as presented in the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income does not give effect to any future borrowings to fund repurchases under the stock repurchase program.\n(b) The modeling guideline for our annual tax rate excludes the impact of the $7.0 million non-cash benefit recognized during the six months ended March 31, 2018. This benefit primarily relates to remeasuring the Company's deferred tax liabilities at the newly enacted federal tax rate. Including the $7.0 million benefit the annual tax rate is estimated to be approximately 13%.\nNet income as presented in the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income may be further impacted by potential future non-operating charges that would impact net income without affecting Adjusted EBITDA.\nConference Call\nThis afternoon, Thursday, May 10, 2018, Civitas Solutions management will host a conference call at 5:00 pm (Eastern Time) to discuss the fiscal 2018 second quarter operating results.\nConference Call Dial-in #:\nDomestic U.S. Toll Free: 877-255-4315 International: 412-317-5467 Replay Details (available 1 hour after conclusion of the conference call through 5/17/18):\nDomestic U.S. Toll Free: 877-344-7529 International: 412-317-0088 Canada Toll Free: 855-669-9658 Replay Access Code: 10120038 A live webcast of the conference call will be available via the investor relations section of the Company\u2019s website: www.civitas-solutions.com . Following the call, an archived replay of the webcast will be available on this website through August 10, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis earnings release includes a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income per diluted common share and net debt, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because it is an important measure used by management to assess financial performance, and management believes it provides a more transparent view of the Company\u2019s underlying operating performance and operating trends. In addition, the Company believes this measurement is important because securities analysts, investors and lenders use this measurement to compare the Company\u2019s performance to other companies in our industry. Adjusted net income per diluted share is presented to exclude non-recurring costs and other expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions that are not reflective of the Company's continuing operating performance. Net debt is presented because it is useful for lenders, securities analysts, and investors in determining the Company's net debt leverage ratio.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, net income per diluted share, revenues or total debt or other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. Similarly, Adjusted net income per diluted share should not be considered a measure of cash flow per common share but rather a performance metric that presents our operating performance taking into account certain of the same adjustments in Adjusted EBITDA and does so on a per share basis. While we and other companies in our industry frequently use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income per diluted share as measures of operating performance and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. All non-GAAP financial measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company\u2019s financial statements filed with the SEC.\nFor a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see \u201cReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d on pages 9 and 10 of this press release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward-looking statements, including our guidance, outlook and statements about our expectations for future financial performance.
