The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTechnology companies led by  General\nElectric Co.  want to revolutionize the nascent medical-\nmonitoring industry by taking to the airwaves. Standing in the\nway is Boeing Co.  \n GE\u2019s health-care unit has asked the Federal Communications\nCommission to allow devices that transmit patients\u2019 vital signs\nto share the 2360MHz to 2400MHz range of the electromagnetic\nspectrum, now used by Chicago-based Boeing to test the safety of\nplanes. It\u2019s the only section of the spectrum where remote\nmonitoring would be cost-effective, according to GE Healthcare.  \n Boeing , the largest U.S. aircraft maker, is urging the FCC\nnot to allow new uses of the space. Transmitting medical signals\non the spectrum would interfere with flight-test data, causing\ndelays that would cost $50,000 an hour, said Audrey Allison, the\ncompany\u2019s frequency-management services director. The disputed\nbandwidth may bring the U.S. as much as $6 billion should the\nFCC decide to auction it, said Coleman Bazelon, an industry\nconsultant at  Brattle Group  in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  \n \u201cThis is a technical issue, and they\u2019ll have to battle it\nout,\u201d said  Robert Litan , an economist and Internet policy\nexpert at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \u201cIt might\nlook like a fight about spectrum, but at the end of the day,\nit\u2019s all about money.\u201d  \n U.S. airwaves transmit everything from television signals\nand mobile-phone calls to FM radio and military communications.\nThe airwaves are sliced into different frequencies, or bands,\nfor specific uses so your phone call doesn\u2019t interfere with a\ntop-secret spy mission, for example.  \n Public Safety  \n The FCC is reallocating portions of the spectrum to unclog\nwireless communications networks and enhance public safety,\nselling off large chunks in auctions that have yielded billions\nof dollars for the U.S. Treasury.  \n The band used by Boeing and coveted by GE may be worth $3\nbillion to $6 billion at auction, Bazelon said. Whether the FCC\nwill even hold an auction isn\u2019t known.  \n The agency will hold a public meeting with the Food and\nDrug Administration July 26 and 27 to discuss using the airwaves\nfor remote monitoring. The systems wirelessly register vital\nstatistics, such as heart rate or blood-oxygen saturation.  \n The technology, already used in some hospitals, promises to\ncut costly doctor visits for millions of patients by allowing\nblood pressure, heart rates and other vital signs to be checked\nat a distance, potentially saving lives and billions of dollars.  \n The devices \u201cmeasure physiological signals continuously,\u201d\nsaid Munesh Makhija, general manager of systems and wireless at\n GE Healthcare , based in Chalfont St. Giles, in the U.K. near\nLondon. They would \u201cmake work flow a lot more productive for\nthe hospital,\u201d he said in an interview.  \n Cost Savings  \n Wireless monitoring would make it simpler to keep tabs on\npatients, especially those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t report on their\nown, Makhija said. Such systems have the potential to generate\ncost savings for the health system, he said.  \n Cutting down on the equipment used to monitor health also\ncan aid infection control, since \u201cyou would not have to clean\nand re-clean cables, tubes and connectors,\u201d Makhija said.  \n An analysis by Litan of Brookings estimated that remote\nmonitoring technologies may save as much as $197 billion in\nhealth-care costs over 25 years.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s a really enticing technology,\u201d said Bernie Liebler,\ndirector of technology and regulatory affairs at the  Advanced\nMedical Technology Association , a Washington-based industry\ngroup. \u201cThis would allow that kind of continuous monitoring\nwhile people are walking around\u201d and carrying out normal day-\nto-day activities, he said.  \n Question of Power  \n When the agency first opened discussion on use of the\nspectrum, it suggested alternative bands for medical monitoring.\nGE Healthcare said those options are unworkable.  \n \u201cChips operating at those frequencies consume too much\npower,\u201d making them too costly to develop and implement widely,\nsaid Neal Seidl, a wireless architect at GE Healthcare.  \n Boeing, which says it needs exclusive use of the spectrum\nto ensure the safety of millions of travelers who fly on its\nairplanes, expects a decision from the FCC \u201cin the next few\nmonths,\u201d Allison said in a May interview.  \n The FCC has no set date on deciding on GE Healthcare\u2019s\nrequest,  Julius Knapp , chief of the commission\u2019s office of\nengineering and technology, said in an interview.  \n International Business Machines Corp.  of Armonk, New York,\nRoyal Philips Electronics NV of Amsterdam, and Nordic\nSemiconductor ASA of Trondheim, Norway, are also developing\ntechnologies to transmit a continuous flow of health information\nusing the spectrum space.  \n Monitoring Market  \n An FCC decision to make the spectrum available for medical\nuse would boost development of remote monitoring, a market\nexpected to reach $4.6 billion in annual revenue by 2014,\naccording to  TMNG Global , a consulting company based in Overland\nPark, Kansas.  \n If the FCC rules in favor of GE Healthcare, Boeing would\npursue its legal options, Allison said. She declined to say what\nthose choices might be. Agency decisions can be challenged in\ncourt.  \n \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that we will find a workable solution,\nbecause it\u2019s so important to protect our ability to do flight\ntests in the U.S.,\u201d Allison said.  \n Remote-monitoring devices have potential for widespread use\nand significant savings for the U.S. health-care system,\ncompared with only a limited use in aircraft testing, said\nPreston Marshall, director of wireless networking at the\nUniversity of Southern California\u2019s  Viterbi School of\nEngineering , in Los Angeles.  \n \u201cWe\u2019re talking a few people who do telemetry or testing,\nversus potentially everyone\u2019s grandmother,\u201d Marshall said.  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Sophia Yan  at   sophiayan@bloomberg.net ;\n Christopher Flavelle  at \n cflavelle@bloomberg.net .  \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                                                 \n                     \n                     Enlarge image \n                     \n                     \n                       Bandwidth Spectrum  \n                       \n                         \n                           \n                         \n                         A specific bandwidth spectrum could be used for wireless medical monitoring.
