 "context": "The following article called 'Einhorn Pares Bet on Stock Rally After \u2018Relentless Climb\u2019' was published on 2013-10-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHedge-fund manager  David Einhorn  is\ntaking a more conservative approach to his investment portfolio\neven as wagers that stocks would fall caused his results to\ntrail the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index.  Long positions, which gain on rising asset prices, exceeded\nshort bets by 35 percentage points as of Sept. 30 at  Greenlight\nCapital Re Ltd. (GLRE) , the Cayman Islands-based reinsurer where\nEinhorn oversees investments and serves as chairman. That\u2019s down\nfrom about 42 percentage points three months earlier, the  money\nmanager  said today on a conference call.  \u201cAs the market continued its relentless climb, we\u2019ve\nbecome more conservatively positioned,\u201d he said.  Einhorn, who gained fame for betting on a decline in Lehman\nBrothers Holdings Inc. stock before it collapsed in 2008, said\nmost of the portfolio gain in the quarter was from long holdings\nin companies including  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  He said he was sticking with\nhis short positions, or wagers that a stock will decline,\nincluding one on  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)   \u201cThe losses in the short book were broad-based, and we\ncontinue to be short most of the companies that contributed to\nthe loss,\u201d he said. \u201cThese include a variety of companies\nwhich tend to have conventional valuations, rather than\nspeculative story stocks that have caused excessive pain for\nother short sellers.\u201d  Jelly Donuts  Greenlight Re\u2019s investment portfolio returned 4 percent in\nthe third quarter and 12 percent in the first nine months of the\nyear, the company said yesterday in a filing. That compares with\n 5.2 percent  and 20 percent for the  S&P 500 , including dividends.\nThe reinsurer\u2019s portfolio was valued at $1.15 billion as of\nSept. 30.  Einhorn, 44, has sounded alarms about the climb in asset\nprices for months. Last year he compared excessive stimulus by\ncentral bankers with eating too many jelly donuts, a habit that\ncan be a threat to long-term health, according to an article\nthat quoted him in Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer.  BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink\nechoed some of that concern during a panel discussion in Chicago\nthis week. The head of the world\u2019s largest money manager said\nthat Federal Reserve efforts are contributing to \u201cbubble-like\nmarkets.\u201d He called on policy makers to begin to taper $85\nbillion a month in bond purchases that have caused the central\nbank\u2019s balance sheet to swell to more than  $3.8 trillion .  Stock Rally  Greenlight Re jumped 6.7 percent to $31.90 at 11:53 a.m.\nafter reporting late yesterday that third-quarter net income\nclimbed to $56.5 million from $46.1 million a year earlier. The\nstock has advanced 38 percent this year.  Einhorn said he accumulated holdings in two new stocks in\nthe third quarter. One was a U.S. technology company that he\ndidn\u2019t identify on the call. The other is  Osram Licht AG (OSR) , a\nGerman lighting company that spun off from Siemens AG. He didn\u2019t\ndisclose the size of either investment.  Osram has cut jobs and said it plans to shut or sell plants\nas it targets 1 billion euros ($1.36 billion) in savings by\n2015. The Munich-based company has advanced about 60 percent\nsince it began trading on July 8.  He also reiterated his support for Newbury, England-based\n Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  after saying earlier this month that it could\nbe an attractive takeover target for  AT&T Inc. (T)  The British\ncompany agreed to sell its 45 percent stake in  Verizon Wireless \nto  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  for $130 billion in September.\nEinhorn said that price was more than he expected.  \u201cWe continue to have exposure to Vodafone\u2019s core business,\nwhich currently trades below its less-exciting peers,\u201d he said.\nThe remaining business will be \u201can attractive acquisition\ntarget on its own.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nNoah Buhayar in  New York  at \n nbuhayar@bloomberg.net .
