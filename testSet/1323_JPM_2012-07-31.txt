 "context": "The following article called 'Nissan Sells $1.4 Billion of Auto ABS at Lowest Yield on Record' was published on 2012-07-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNissan Motor Co. sold $1.4 billion\nof bonds tied to auto loans at the lowest rate ever as the\n Federal Reserve \u2019s efforts to spur economic growth reduce\nborrowing costs.  The company issued the top-rated securities with an average\nlife of 1.49 years to yield 0.481 percent, the lowest financing\nrate for an auto company in the asset-backed market on record,\naccording to data from  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the lead manager of the\ntransaction. Though spreads on the debt were narrower in 2006,\nthe higher lending benchmarks boosted the cost, the data show.  Issuance of asset-backed securities is surging as investors\nseek out safe alternatives to Treasuries, which recently reached\nrecord-low yields. Companies from Ford Motor Co. to JPMorgan\nChase & Co. have sold about $129 billion in asset-backed\nsecurities linked to consumer and business borrowing this year,\nwith auto debt accounting for $62 billion, excluding today\u2019s\nsale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Citigroup raised\nits 2012 asset-backed forecast this month by about 50 percent to\n$183 billion.  \u201cWe are seeing extraordinary demand for safe assets in the\nface of broader market volatility,\u201d Gerry Keefe, the New York-\nbased head of securitized products at Citigroup, said in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cDemand is far outstripping supply.\u201d  Treasury yields sank to record lows last week, with the 10-\nyear note falling as low as 1.379 percent on July 25 amid\nconcern that the  European debt crisis  was slowing the global\neconomy. The 30-year bond touched a record 2.44 percent July 26.  Haven Status  The Fed has kept its target rate for overnight loans\nbetween banks at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, and\nsaid it expects to keep it \u201cexceptionally low\u201d through at\nleast late 2014.  Investors are snapping up bonds linked to auto loans with\ndelinquencies holding at less than 1 percent, according to\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service. Payments more than 60 days late from\nborrowers with the best credit stood at 0.38 percent in May,\ndown from 0.88 percent a year earlier, the New York-based\nratings company said in a July 17 report.  \u201cConsumer ABS has a growing safe haven,\u201d status, said\nJohn McElravey, an analyst at  Wells Fargo & Co . based in\n Charlotte ,  North Carolina .  Investors are wagering that U.S. households will stay\ncurrent on their bills with  confidence  among U.S. consumers\nunexpectedly rising for the first time in five months in July,\naccording to the Conference Board. The New York-based private\nresearch group\u2019s index increased to 65.9 this month from 62.7 in\nJune, according to figures released today. Economists projected\na reading of 61.5, according to the median estimate in a\nBloomberg News survey.  U.S. auto sales for June beat analysts\u2019 estimates,\naccelerating to a 14.1 million seasonally adjusted annualized\nrate, researcher Autodata Corp. said in a July 3 statement. The\npace exceeded the average 13.8 million light-vehicle estimate of\n15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
