 "context": "The following article called 'Spain\u2019s Bad Bank Begins 15-Year Suicide With Bull Sale' was published on 2013-05-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSpain \u2019s Sareb, set up last year to\nacquire 90 billion euros ($116 billion) of soured real estate\nassets at a discount from rescued lenders, is preparing its\nfirst sale, known as \u2018Project Bull,\u2019 to test the beleaguered\nproperty market\u2019s ability to attract investors.  Sareb has hired  KPMG  LLP to market a pool of homes located\nin the south and east of Spain, in Andalusia and Valencia, as\nwell as unfinished buildings, according to four people with\nknowledge of the auction. Bids are due by July 18 on the real\nestate, which could be worth about 200 million euros, said the\npeople, who asked not to be named because it\u2019s private.  \u201cSuccess on the first sale would be a signal to other\ninvestors that there\u2019s an opportunity here, but this is a big\nhurdle,\u201d said Lee Tyrrell-Hendry, a credit strategist at Royal\nBank of Scotland Group Plc in  London . \u201cInvestors are looking\nfor yield and Spain is one of the few areas you can get it, but\nthat is because there are still huge risks and the economic\noutlook is still weak.\u201d  Private equity firms including  Leon Black \u2019s  Apollo Global\nManagement LLC (APO) , Thomas Barrack Jr.\u2019s  Colony Capital LLC  and\nbillionaire Wilbur Ross are among those circling, looking for\nways to profit from Spain\u2019s property crash, which sent home\nprices down 39 percent since the 2007 peak and drove\nunemployment to 27.2 percent. Foreign investment will be\ncritical to Sareb, which must meet a target of 1.5 billion euros\nin sales this year to demonstrate its viability to investors.  Toxic Assets  Under Chairwoman Belen Romana, Sareb has pledged to sell\nabout 45,000 properties, approximately half its stock, in the\nfirst five years, and has a maximum 15-year lifespan. Over that\nperiod it aims to generate an annual internal rate of return of\n13- to 14 percent for its shareholders, before shutting down.  Spain created its bad bank last year to help lenders facing\ncapital shortages sell their toxic real estate assets as part of\nthe commitments agreed to for a bailout of 41 billion euros from\nthe European Union. Investors including  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,\n Barclays Plc (BARC) , Spanish lenders and insurance companies agreed to\npurchase 55 percent of the capital in Sareb, allowing the\ngovernment to keep the facility\u2019s debts off its books.  The unit bought almost 200,000 assets, mostly plots of land\nand housing, for about 50 billion euros, with average discounts\nranging from about 46 percent on loans to as much as 80 percent\non land purchases, from eight Spanish banks starting in\nDecember.  Sareb\u2019s first sale contains about 38 completed\ndevelopments, many in Andalusia and Valencia, and at least one\nunfinished project, according to the people with knowledge of\nthe offering.  \u2018Real Push\u2019  \u201cThey probably will find buyers because right now there\u2019s\na real push out there to find assets on the part of investors,\nbut there\u2019s risk that goes into this obviously,\u201d said  Scott MacDonald , head of research at  Stamford , Connecticut-based\ninvestment firm MC Asset Management Holdings LLC and co-author\nof \u201cWhen Small Countries Crash.\u201d Central banks have pumped in\na massive amount of money, he said, pushing investors to look\nfor yields and fueling demand for riskier trades.  The extra yield investors demand to hold  junk bonds  rather\nthan government debt fell this month to 4.23 percentage points,\nthe least since 2007. Spanish 10-year yields have dropped to\nabout 4.20 percent from 5.17 percent at the end of January.  A Sareb spokesman declined to comment on the sale and\nChristina Milner, a spokeswoman for KPMG\u2019s Spanish affiliate,\nKPMG Asesores SL, did not respond to a request for comment.  Sareb holdings also include 76,357 vacant and 6,293 rented\nhomes, along with 14,859 parcels of land. The institution also\nowns property development loans, for 61,702 finished and 3,924\nprojects under construction, according to Sareb.  Economic Troubles  \u201cSpain is still suffering from rising  unemployment ,\nbankruptcies and declining confidence, so the bad bank may want\nto wait another few years before selling more assets in order to\nrealize more value as economic conditions gradually stabilize,\u201d\nTyrrell-Hendry said.  Sareb is already luring foreign investors and private\nequity firms, which have been negotiating to purchase\nproperties, according to people with knowledge of the\nnegotiations.  Apollo, which raised a $3.6 billion fund last year to\ninvest in European non-performing loans and other assets, may be\ninterested in buying completed apartment units close to large\ncities, which would need to be rented or sold, according to two\npeople familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified\nbecause the strategy is private.  Charles Zehren , a spokesman for  New York  based Apollo,\ndeclined to comment. The investment firm oversees $113 billion.  Unfinished Residential  Colony, which has bought about $50 billion of real estate\nsince it was founded in 1991, is seeking to finance well-located\nunfinished residential assets, said people familiar with the\nmatter, who also asked not to be identified because the\nnegotiations are private.  Lisa Baker , a spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Colony,\ndeclined to comment.  Wilbur Ross said May 20 on Bloomberg Television he will\nvisit Spain later this week. He\u2019s weighing investing in its\nbanks amid signs the country is starting \u201cto come to grips\u201d\nwith its financial crisis and will consider buying assets put up\nfor sale by Sareb.  Property Challenges  The bad bank faces challenges in selling its real estate.\nAround 400,000 foreclosures have been ordered in the country\nafter the decade-long property bubble burst in 2008 and\nunemployment is the highest in at least 37 years. Mariano Rajoy\u2019s People Party is pursuing the harshest austerity measures\nin the country\u2019s democratic history to curtail surging borrowing\ncosts that last year pushed Spain to the verge of a bailout.  Voters have elected populist politicians in some regions\nadvocating measures that complicate asset sales. In Andalusia,\nthe regional government is planning to expropriate foreclosed\nproperties for as long as three years.  Home prices  will fall a further 20 percent over the next\nfour years as \u201cprecarious\u201d economic conditions deter buyers\nand as \u201cswathes\u201d of unsold housing stock drag on prices,\nSophie Tahiri, a Paris-based economist for  Standard & Poor\u2019s ,\nwrote in a report last month.  Sareb is also competing for buyers with banks that didn\u2019t\nreceive bailout funds and also are trying to sell assets.  CaixaBank SA is selling 12,000 homes valued at 1.5 billion\neuros, Spain\u2019s El Confidencial reported last month.  FAB Funds  Romana, former secretary general of the Circulo de\nEmpresarios and an ex-board director of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) \u2019s\nconsumer unit Banesto, wants to find buyers wherever she can to\nensure the bad bank dies within the 15-year horizon.  In addition to sales through retail channels, Sareb is\nsetting up Spain\u2019s first Bank Asset Funds, or FABs, which will\nbe tax-attractive vehicles designed to appeal to foreign\ninvestors. Their creation and operation will be supervised by\nthe Spanish stock exchange commission.  \u201cFor Spain to get out of its current economic woes, it\nneeds to get rid of a lot of the dead weight that is sitting in\nthe banking sector,\u201d said MC Asset\u2019s MacDonald. \u201cThe bad bank\nplays a role in terms of helping to get the bad assets out of\nthe system, to restructure them and be able to sell them off. It\nadds a positive factor, but you have a fair amount of work ahead\nof you.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nHeather Perlberg in New York at \n hperlberg@bloomberg.net \nDavid Carey in New York at \n dcarey13@bloomberg.net ;  To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nRob Urban at \n robprag@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Banco Santander, S.A.
