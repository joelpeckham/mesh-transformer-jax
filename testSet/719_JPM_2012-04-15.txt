 "context": "The following article called 'Gorman\u2019s Lonely Quest to Save Wall Street\u2019s Honor' was published on 2012-04-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThere has been a noticeable dearth\nof leadership on Wall Street after the financial crisis.  Where are the senior executives willing to explain to the\nAmerican people how and why the financial industry\u2019s behavior\ngot our economy into so much trouble and why that behavior needs\nto change if there is to be any hope of restoring the public\u2019s\nconfidence in our  capital markets ? Without that restored faith,\nyou can pretty much forget about any economic recovery anytime\nsoon.  Instead of rising to the occasion, Wall Street\u2019s purported\ntop rung --  Lloyd Blankfein , the chief executive officer of\n Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ; and  Jamie Dimon , CEO of  JPMorgan Chase\n& Co. (JPM)  -- have been too busy either defending their own\nindefensible actions leading up to the crisis (Blankfein) or\ncomplaining about how new regulations are impeding profitability\n(Dimon) to give any thought to fundamentally changing the way\nWall Street does business. So far, they have shown the opposite\nof leadership: blatant self-interest.  Fortunately, as Aristotle taught us, nature abhors a\nvacuum. And into the leadership breach has quietly stepped the\nAustralian-born  James Gorman , the 53-year-old former McKinsey &\nCo. consultant and Merrill Lynch & Co. executive who has been\nthe CEO of Morgan Stanley since 2010 and both chairman and CEO\nsince the beginning of the year. In his unassuming way, Gorman\nhas come out swinging.  Compensation Clawbacks  He started a buzz at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos in\nJanuary, when Bloomberg Television\u2019s  Erik Schatzker  asked him to\nexplain why Morgan Stanley had taken the lead by instituting\ncompensation clawbacks and deferrals and by capping cash payouts\nat $125,000 a year. Gorman said he would tell the following to\nemployees who failed to grasp the logic of his decision.\n\u201cYou\u2019re naive. Read the newspaper, No. 1,\u201d he said. \u201cNo. 2, if\nyou put your compensation in a one-year context to define your\noverall level of happiness, you have a problem which is much\nbigger than the job. And No. 3, if you\u2019re really unhappy, just\nleave. I mean, life\u2019s too short.\u201d  For good measure, he added, \u201cThe world has changed and the\nbanking industry has gone through a fundamental change, and we\nhave to readjust.\u201d  Exactly. Unlike Blankfein and Dimon, Gorman understands\nthat true leadership means perceiving the world as it really is\n-- and dealing with it -- not wishing it were something that it\nno longer is.  Gorman expanded on this theme last week during an\nappearance on the \u201cCharlie Rose\u201d show. He said it was\nessential for  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to get back to helping its clients\nsolve their problems, rather than focusing on ways to make a big\nfinancial score.  \u201cThe most important thing with any professional service\nfirm is to tap the DNA to find out what it is that is the magic\nabout the institution,\u201d he said. \u201cThe magic of Morgan Stanley\nis the quality of the people dealing with exceptionally\ncomplicated problems, helping clients find solutions to tough\nsituations. So my challenge is to get us back to those roots, to\namplify those roots and to let the organization run with it.\u201d\n(OK, there\u2019s more than a dollop of corporate pabulum in this\nstatement, but there\u2019s also an element of truth.)  He said the days of proprietary trading are over at Morgan\nStanley. \u201cThat was sort of a stray off the reservation,\u201d he\nsaid, adding that while a number of firms made a bunch of money\ntrading for their own account, \u201cMorgan Stanley had always made\nmoney serving its clients.  That was our reason to be. That was\nat the core, as I said, of the DNA.\u201d  Proprietary Trading  While he didn\u2019t mention Howard L. Hubler, a Morgan Stanley\ntrader who was blamed for a $9 billion loss on an ill-timed\nproprietary trade in  2007 , Gorman conceded: \u201cWe got envious. A\nlot of firms got envious. And it\u2019s the problem with corporate\nstrategy. You\u2019ve got to stick to what you\u2019re good at. Just\nbecause somebody else is good at it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to\nbe good at it. And we started trying to be what somebody else\nwas good at.\u201d  He said it was time to accept  greater regulation  that will\neither prevent firms from engaging in proprietary trading or\nrequire them to hold so much capital in reserve as to make this\nactivity economically unattractive. He said he is a believer in\na steadier stream of consistent earnings.  \u201cWhat investors want ultimately is certainty,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey want to know the strategy you\u2019re on. Why it is that\nyou\u2019re going to succeed on it and they want to see consistent\nreturns. In the proprietary-trading businesses, they\u2019re very\nvolatile. And investors discount it because they don\u2019t know if\nyou can repeat it the next quarter.\u201d  Gorman\u2019s big strategic bet on  wealth management  -- Morgan\nStanley bought 51 percent of the Smith Barney brokerage from\nCitigroup Inc. in January 2009 and is said to be negotiating to\nbuy the remainder -- and his push to refocus the firm on helping\nclients solve problems hasn\u2019t shown up in the financial\nperformance or the stock price, which has been a laggard in\nrecent years. Yet his willingness to concede mistakes, to accept\nthe new regulation and to return his firm to its once-famous\nfocus on clients is bound to pay off soon.  One thing has become abundantly clear on  Wall Street : Its\ncustomers and its counterparties are sick and tired of being\ngamed, and the firm -- or firms -- that first restores the trust\nthat has been lost will be the most successful in the future.
