 "context": "The following article called 'Islamist Win Seen as Plus for Egypt Stability -- for Now' was published on 2012-06-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe victory of Muslim Brotherhood\ncandidate Mohamed Mursi in  Egypt \u2019s presidential election will\nre-establish the stability the U.S. seeks in the Middle Eastern\nnation, if only temporarily.  While the U.S. welcomed yesterday\u2019s announcement that\nMursi, 60, defeated the military\u2019s pick, Ahmed Shafik, the\nelection is only the beginning of what\u2019s apt to be a protracted\nconfrontation between the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood and the more\nsecular military that will complicate American interests in the\nregion, according to  Aaron David Miller , a senior fellow at the\nWilson Center, a  Washington  policy group.  \u201cWe\u2019re trapped between a rising Islamic current we don\u2019t\ntrust and a Praetorian military establishment that we don\u2019t like\nbut we\u2019ll be forced to support for some very good reasons,\nincluding the peace treaty with  Israel ,\u201d Miller said in an\ninterview. \u201cFor Americans, this is the better outcome because\nit preserves a balance between the military and the Islamists.\nWe\u2019re going to have to deal with both of them.\u201d  Mursi\u2019s victory highlights the tension between the Obama\nadministration\u2019s rhetoric on Egyptian democratic change and\nAmerica\u2019s strategic interests in the region. While the\nadministration supports the \u201cArab Spring\u201d movement,\nlongstanding U.S. ties and billions in aid to former president\n Hosni Mubarak \u2019s autocratic regime helped maintain Egypt\u2019s peace\ntreaty with Israel and U.S. military access through the  Suez\nCanal  to the  Persian Gulf .  Under a civilian Islamic government, the future of those\ninterests may depend in part on whether and how Egypt\u2019s elected\nand military leaders share power. That uncertainty already has\ncaused friction between Congress and the Obama administration.  \u2018Mutual Respect\u2019  President  Barack Obama  congratulated Mursi for securing\n51.7 percent of the vote in a telephone call late yesterday and\nthe two leaders pledged to improve bilateral ties.  Obama \u201cunderscored that the  United States  will continue to\nsupport Egypt\u2019s transition to democracy and stand by the\nEgyptian people,\u201d according to an e-mailed White House\nstatement. The president said he would work with Mursi \u201con the\nbasis of mutual respect,\u201d and the new Egyptian leader\n\u201cexpressed appreciation for the call and welcomed U.S. support\nfor Egypt\u2019s transition,\u201d according to the statement.  Yesterday\u2019s election announcement was preceded by military\nmoves to consolidate power at the expense of the incoming\npresident, re-establish martial law and assume the powers of the\nlegislative branch. A constitution still has to be written,\nwhile Egypt\u2019s courts dissolved parliament last week in a move\nthat was \u201cclearly a political decision,\u201d said  Marina Ottaway ,\ndirector of the Middle East program at the Carnegie Institute, a\nWashington policy group.  Military Aid  Senator  Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who heads the\nbudget committee that funds the State Department and foreign\naid, made clear his anger about the military\u2019s actions and\nvoiced his disapproval of the Obama administration\u2019s decision to\nmaintain military aid to Egypt. Yesterday, he said that his\nstance on continuing the aid will depend on the military.  \u201cThe next step is up to the generals and how the\nconstitution is written,\u201d Leahy said in an e-mail.  The administration wants to see the democratic transition\ncompleted, Carney said. \u201cIt is essential for the Egyptian\ngovernment to continue to fulfill Egypt\u2019s role as a pillar of\nregional peace, security and stability.\u201d  With legislative authority now in the military\u2019s hands,\nit\u2019s unlikely any laws or practices the U.S. cares about will\nchange \u201canytime soon,\u201d said  David Schenker , director of the\nprogram on Arab politics at the Washington Institute for Near\nEast Policy.  Domestic Issues  In the short-term, Egypt\u2019s civilian rulers will focus on\ndomestic issues, including re-establishing security in the  Sinai\nPeninsula  and righting Egypt\u2019s devastated economy, he said.  The yield on Egypt\u2019s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020\nsoared the most last week since they were sold in April 2010.\nThe rate jumped 97 basis points to 7.87 percent in the week that\nended June 22, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That\nincluded a 52 basis-point surge on the last day of the week.  The Arab country\u2019s five-year credit default risk jumped 68\nbasis points last week to 723, the highest level since December\n2008, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and\ncompiles prices from the privately negotiated market. Egypt is\namong the 10 riskiest credits in the world.  Over time, when elections are held again, the Brotherhood\nis likely to repeat its success at the ballot box, forcing the\nmilitary to relinquish legislative control, Schenker said. That\nwill put the Islamists in control of foreign policy, potentially\ntriggering a military backlash and sparking unease in the U.S.\nand elsewhere, he said.  \u2018Alarming\u2019 Americans  \u201cIn the event that the Brotherhood swept into power in\nEgypt, that would alarm a large number of Americans and a large\nnumber of U.S. allies in the region,\u201d including the Sunni Gulf\nStates that distrust Shiite Islamists, and the Israelis, said\n Jon Alterman , director of the Middle East program at the Center\nfor Strategic and International Studies, a policy group in\nWashington. \u201cThere would surely be people talking about cutting\noff the relationship,\u201d he said, with all the implications that\nwould have for military access from the Mediterranean to the\nPersian Gulf and the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty.  Senator  John Kerry , the Massachusetts Democrat who heads\nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement that\n\u201cAmerican concerns about the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s past\nstatements and positions are widely shared and well\nunderstood.\u201d  \u2018Serious Questions\u2019  While noting \u201cserious questions about the future direction\nof Egypt\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Kerry said \u201cit would be a mistake\nfor us to pull back from our engagement with a free and\ndemocratic Egypt.\u201d  For now, the military and the Islamists are beginning a\ndrawn-out struggle, Alterman said. \u201cThe battle lines are drawn,\nthe standoff will be fought over the next couple of years,\u201d he\nsaid.  Ottaway said that initially it will be hard for the\nBrotherhood to be effective as it faces the vestiges of the old\nregime. \u201cThe military, the top levels of Egyptian bureaucracy,\nand the courts are on one side, the  Muslim Brotherhood  on the\nother,\u201d she said.  Change is under way, though, she said. In the November 2010\nelections, the Mubarak regime \u201ctotally manipulated\u201d the\noutcome by blocking moderate opposition parties from getting\nmany seats and the Brotherhood from getting any, Ottaway said.\nThough many Egyptians and some U.S. officials expected the\nmilitary to give the presidency to Shafik, Mubarak\u2019s last\npremier, \u201ctoday, they did not dare do the same thing. The\nchange is huge, but it\u2019s a long battle ahead,\u201d Ottaway said by\ntelephone from  Beirut .  Two Themes  That battle is likely to have two main themes, Schenker\nsaid. One will be an internal struggle within the Islamist camp,\nwith the more conservative Salafists pushing the Muslim\nBrotherhood to the right in ways that will have domestic impact.  Recently, the Salafists objected to a $500 million Japanese\nloan to build a Cairo metro because it involved interest, which\nis forbidden in Islam. \u201cHow is that going to work out with the\nIMF loan?\u201d Schenker said of the $3.2 billion Egypt needs from\nthe  International Monetary Fund .  Another dynamic will echo shifts seen in  Turkey , where an\nIslamic civilian government has steadily sidelined the military.  \u201cNow, in Turkey, the military has been defanged,\u201d\nSchenker said. \u201cOne-fifth of all the generals in Turkey are in\njail. The elected Islamic leadership has brought the military to\nheel.\u201d The head of Egypt\u2019s ruling military council, Field\nMarshal Hussein Tantawi, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to end up in a cage, but\nultimately, this is what the Brotherhood wants,\u201d Schenker said.
