The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRetail gasoline prices  in the U.S.\ndropped to the lowest for this season in three years after crude\nfutures capped the biggest weekly drop in six months.  Regular, unleaded gasoline at the pump declined 3.7 cents,\nor 1 percent, to $3.608 a gallon, the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration said on its website yesterday. Prices fell in\nevery region of the country except for the Rocky Mountain area,\naccording to the EIA, the Energy Department\u2019s statistical arm.  Retail gasoline prices have retreated for six straight\nweeks and are 33.1 cents a gallon below year-earlier levels.\nOil, which accounts for about two-thirds of the cost of the\nmotor-fuel, declined 4.7 percent last week, the biggest loss\nsince the period ended Sept. 21.  Gasoline \u201cprobably has another 6 or 7 cents a gallon to\nfall in the short-term as the decline in crude prices last week\nflows through from refining operations,\u201d  James Williams ,\npresident of energy consulting firm WTRG Economics in  London ,\n Arkansas , said by telephone yesterday. \u201cThe drops should\ncontinue for several days to a week.\u201d  West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery climbed 66\ncents, or 0.7 percent, to $93.36 a barrel on the  New York \nMercantile Exchange yesterday, the first gain in four days.\nPrices were at $93.46 a barrel today.  Crude stockpiles in the U.S. increased 0.7 percent to 388.6\nmillion barrels in the seven days ended March 29, the highest in\nmore than 22 years, the EIA said April 3. They probably added\nanother 1.5 million barrels, or 0.4 percent, last week,\naccording to the median of eight analyst estimates before the\nagency\u2019s next report tomorrow.  Refinery Maintenance  Gasoline supplies slipped 0.3 percent in the week ended\nMarch 29 to 220.7 million barrels, the EIA data showed. They\nprobably slid another 1.8 million barrels, or 0.8 percent, to\n218.9 million last week, according to the Bloomberg survey.  A monthlong maintenance turnaround at  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) \u2019s\n200,700-barrel-a-day Chalmette refinery in  Louisiana  took about\na week longer than expected and was scheduled to begin restoring\nproduction late last week, a person with direct knowledge of the\nwork said April 3.  Motiva Enterprises LLC\u2019s 600,000-barrel-a-day Port Arthur\nrefinery in Texas, the largest in the U.S., will keep a crude\nunit shut for another week of repairs, two people familiar with\noperations there said April 3. The equipment was taken out of\nservice in mid-February for what was originally estimated to be\na 38-day turnaround.
