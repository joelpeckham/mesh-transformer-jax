 "context": "The following article called 'Vale Promises Turnaround After Posting Record Loss' was published on 2013-02-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVale SA (VALE) , the world\u2019s biggest iron-\nore producer, said it\u2019s poised to benefit from a price recovery\nand a balance-sheet cleanup that spurred a record quarterly\nloss. Shares rose the most in a month.  The miner, based in Rio de Janeiro, is focusing only on\nprojects that bring \u201cbig returns,\u201d Chief Executive Officer\nMurilo Ferreira told analysts on a conference call today. Vale\nyesterday posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.65 billion\nafter writing down the value of some nickel, coal and steel\nassets, compared with a year-earlier profit of $4.67 billion.  Ferreira is selling assets, cutting investments and writing\ndown unprofitable projects amid falling metal and mineral\nprices. The company, which in October ceded its place as the\nworld\u2019s second-largest miner by market value to  Rio Tinto  Group,\nis also focusing on expanding its profitable iron-ore unit after\noutput fell 0.8 percent in 2012.  \u201cWe see initial signs of cost, expenses and working\ncapital reduction,\u201d Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts led by\n Marcelo Aguiar  wrote in a note to clients yesterday. The \u201cstock\nis trading at one of its highest historical discounts to peers\non regulatory uncertainty that we view as overdone.\u201d  Vale  rose  3.1 percent to 36.55 reais at the close in  Sao\nPaulo  today, the most since Jan. 31. The stock was the most\ntraded by value on the benchmark Bovespa Index today at 2.2\ntimes the company\u2019s three-month full-day average. Vale fell 14\npercent in the 12 months before today, more than the 13 percent\ndecline in  Brazil \u2019s benchmark Bovespa Index.  \u2018Discipline, Persistence\u2019  \u201cWe have great confidence that these negative numbers that\nyou see today will become strongly positive,\u201d Ferreira said on\ntoday\u2019s conference call. \u201cWith discipline, persistence and\npatience we will bring the results that our investors and\nanalysts expect.\u201d  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization declined 41 percent to $4.39 billion in the\nquarter, missing a $4.79 billion average estimate by 14 analysts\n compiled  by Bloomberg.  \u201cThe lower-than-expected Ebitda generation was a\ncombination of realized iron-ore prices being 6 percent less\nthan forecast combined with higher expenses, mostly due to\nhigher freight costs,\u201d HSBC Holdings Plc analyst Jonathan Brandt said in a note yesterday.  The quarterly loss includes $5.66 billion in charges. Vale\ncut the value of its Onca Puma nickel project by $2.85 billion,\ntook a $1.03 billion charge on Australian coal assets and a $975\nmillion writedown on its stake in aluminum producer  Norsk Hydro\nASA. (NHY)  It also booked a $583 million charge on its share of\n ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) \u2019s CSA steel plant in Rio state and a $94 million\ncharge for its oil and gas assets.  Industry Writedowns  The writedowns follow similar decisions by other producers\nincluding Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton Ltd., the world\u2019s largest\nmining company.  Declining metal and mineral prices have triggered more than\n$60 billion in writedowns in mining and steel companies since\nearly 2012. Failed deals in aluminum and coal caused $14 billion\nin writedowns at Rio and led CEO Tom Albanese to lose his job.\nCost overruns at Anglo American Plc\u2019s flagship Minas-Rio iron-\nore project in Brazil were followed by  Cynthia Carroll \u2019s\nannounced departure as the company\u2019s top executive. Anglo\nslashed $4 billion from the value of Minas Rio.  Vale\u2019s net sales dropped 19 percent to $11.7 billion in the\nquarter after the company sold iron ore at an average $93.70 a\nmetric ton, down from $121.38 last year and more than a $90-a-\nton estimate by Banco Santander SA. Nickel\u2019s average sales price\nfell 4.5 percent and copper slid 2.6 percent.  Better Prices  The fourth-quarter loss is the largest since at least 1997,\nwhen the company went public.  The company expects better iron-ore prices in the first\nhalf, while prices \u201cmay suffer a bit\u201d in the second half of\n2013 because of an expected supply increases, Jose Carlos Martins, Vale\u2019s head of ferrous and strategy, said on the\nconference call. He forecast a \u201cquite healthy\u201d performance in\n China  this year.  Vale shipped 84.8 million tons of  iron ore  and pellets in\nthe quarter, 5.1 percent more than a year earlier. Pellets are a\nprocessed form of iron ore used by the  steel industry . Nickel\nsale volumes dropped 16 percent to 58,000 tons and copper\nshipments fell by 30 percent to 79,000 tons, the company said.  Iron-ore prices  rallied  39 percent in the fourth quarter,\ncapping a 4.6 percent annual gain after tumbling 19 percent in\n2011, according to data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  \u201cDriven by Chinese steelmakers carrying out restocking and\nthe impact of winter related lower Chinese iron ore production,\nVale managed to successfully boost its iron ore sales,\u201d Alan\nGlezer, an equity analyst at Banco Bradesco BBI SA, wrote in an\ne-mailed note to clients.  Halted Project  The company, which earlier this year halted works at its\n$5.9 billion Rio Colorado potash project in  Argentina , will\ndiscuss options for the venture at a board meeting scheduled for\nMarch 11, Ferreira told reporters in a call yesterday. Vale,\nwhich aimed to announce the sale of a stake in its general cargo\nunit VLI by February, will need a few more weeks to make a\n\u201cfinal decision\u201d on its possible partners, he also said.  Vale invested $17.7 billion in 2012, or 83 percent of the\n$21.4 billion initially budgeted for the year, it said. Total\ndebt as of Dec. 31 rose 4.5 percent to $30.5 billion from the\nprevious quarter.
