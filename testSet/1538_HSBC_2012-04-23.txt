The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIndia \u2019s rupee weakened the most in\nmore than three weeks on concern  Europe \u2019s debt crisis will hurt\neconomic growth in  emerging markets .  The currency fell to the lowest level in more than three\nmonths after a survey of companies in  China  showed manufacturing\nin Asia\u2019s biggest economy may shrink for a sixth month in April,\nthe longest period of contraction since the global financial\ncrisis. The rupee gained earlier after India\u2019s central bank\n eased rules  on overseas borrowings by local companies.  \u201cThe economic concerns are not allowing an appreciation in\nthe rupee,\u201d said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at state-run\nAndhra Bank in Mumbai. \u201cConcern about dollar paucity eased a\nbit as the new external borrowings can be used to refinance\nforeign-currency bonds due later this year.\u201d  The rupee declined 0.8 percent to 52.5250 per dollar in\nMumbai, after strengthening 0.1 percent earlier, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. That is the biggest drop since March\n29 and it touched 52.58, the lowest level since Jan. 9. One-\nmonth implied volatility for the rupee, a measure of exchange-\nrate swings used to price options, rose four basis points, or\n0.04 percentage point, to 9.89 percent.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics reported a\npreliminary reading of 49.1 for their China purchasing managers\u2019\nindex in April, compared with a final 48.3 in March. A number\nless than 50 signals contraction.  European Central Bank officials led by President Mario\nDraghi resisted calls from the  International Monetary Fund  and\nU.S. Treasury to do more to stem the debt crisis roiling the\neuro-area economy.  Refinancing Overseas Loans  The  Reserve Bank  of India allowed domestic firms to pay\nhigher  interest rates  to refinance foreign-currency loans,\naccording to a statement on April 20. Indian companies may\ndefault on 20 percent of $7 billion in dollar-denominated\nequity-linked bond payments due in 2012,  Fitch Ratings  said in\nFebruary.  India, which runs a trade deficit, faces a shortage of\ndollars when capital inflows slow or reverse, according to BNP\nParibas SA. Overseas funds cut  holdings  of Indian debt by $100\nmillion last week through April 19, exchange data show.  \u201cThe extent of the rupee\u2019s recent weakening might have\ncaught some off guard,\u201d said Chin Loo Thio, a senior analyst at\nBNP Paribas in  Singapore . \u201cThe RBI is likely to be concerned\nthat there might be unhedged dollar exposures which could drive\nthe rupee lower, especially if flows are not enough to cover the\ndeficits.\u201d  The French bank today recommended investors sell the rupee\nand buy the  U.S. dollar , targeting 53.50, and exit the trade at\n51.75 to limit losses, should the Indian currency strengthen.  Six-month onshore forwards traded at 54.39 per dollar,\ncompared with  53.89 at the end of last week, and offshore non-\ndeliverable contracts were at 54.49 versus 54.02.
