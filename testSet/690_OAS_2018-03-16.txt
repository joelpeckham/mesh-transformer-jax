REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins Falcon, an ex-state governor and former ally of Maduro\u2019s predecessor Hugo Chavez, defied an opposition boycott of the presidential election to run despite conditions critics say are rigged to ensure the ruling socialists retain control. \u201cWe all knew that Henri Falcon would be an instrument of the Venezuelan government to divide the opposition - and his candidacy ends up proving it,\u201d Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the 34-member OAS, told an event in Madrid. \u201cHenri Falcon\u2019s candidacy benefits \u2018chavismo\u2019 (the ruling movement). We asked the Venezuelan opposition to sort the wheat from the chaff and Henri Falcon is the chaff that has separated alone,\u201d he added in comments to Reuters at the Casa de America cultural center. Almagro reiterated his calls for harsher sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s \u201cdictatorship\u201d. He said last month sanctions should be targeted against Venezuela\u2019s all-important oil sector to intensify financial pressure on Maduro\u2019s government, which has presided over five years of crippling recession. Venezuela\u2019s main opposition coalition has rebuked Falcon for legitimizing an election they deem a farce, as Maduro\u2019s most popular rivals are barred from standing and the election board favors the government. Maduro denies the system is undemocratic and calls the OAS a pawn of U.S. policy. Falcon broke with the socialists in 2010 and is now promising a \u201cnational unity\u201d government. While most analysts give him little chance, some recent polls actually put him ahead of Maduro in voter preferences. Falcon has said the opposition\u2019s boycott is ineffective and will only give Maduro an uncontested win, arguing that 80 percent of Venezuelans wanted change.
