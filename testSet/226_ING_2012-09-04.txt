The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFollowing is the text of the U.S.\nmanufacturing conditions from the  Institute for Supply\nManagement .\nAugust Manufacturing ISM Report On Business; PMI at 49.6%; New Orders\nand Production Contracting; Employment and Inventories Growing;\nSupplier Deliveries Faster\nBusiness Wire\nTEMPE, Ariz. -- September 04, 2012\nEconomic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in August\nfor the third time since July 2009; however, the overall economy grew\nfor the 39th consecutive month, say the nation\u2019s supply executives in\nthe latest Manufacturing ISM Report On Business.\nThe report was issued today by Bradley J. Holcomb, CPSM, CPSD, chair\nof the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Business Survey\nCommittee. \u201cThe PMI registered 49.6 percent, a decrease of 0.2\npercentage point from July\u2019s reading of 49.8 percent, indicating\ncontraction in the manufacturing sector for the third consecutive\nmonth. This is also the lowest reading for the PMI since July 2009.\nThe New Orders Index registered 47.1 percent, a decrease of 0.9\npercentage point from July, indicating contraction in new orders for\nthe third consecutive month. The Production Index registered 47.2\npercent, a decrease of 4.1 percentage points and indicating\ncontraction in production for the first time since May 2009. The\nEmployment Index remained in growth territory at 51.6 percent, but\nregistered its lowest reading since November 2009 when the Employment\nIndex registered 51 percent. The Prices Index increased 14.5\npercentage points from its July reading to 54 percent. Comments from\nthe panel generally reflect a slowdown in orders and demand, with\ncontinuing concern over the uncertain state of global economies.\u201d\nPERFORMANCE BY INDUSTRY\nOf the 18 manufacturing industries, eight are reporting growth in\nAugust in the following order: Printing & Related Support Activities;\nPrimary Metals; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Petroleum & Coal\nProducts; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Paper Products;\nChemical Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The eight\nindustries reporting contraction in August -- listed in order -- are:\nTextile Mills; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Furniture & Related\nProducts; Computer & Electronic Products;  Electrical Equipment ,\nAppliances & Components; Transportation Equipment; Fabricated Metal\nProducts; and Machinery.\nWHAT RESPONDENTS ARE SAYING \u2026  \u201cInternal indicators and feedback from sales channels are\nindicating a slowdown in demand for capital equipment.\u201d\n(Machinery)  \u201cBusiness continues to be very solid, but there is now a slowing\nof incoming orders.\u201d (Fabricated Metal Products)  \u201cIncoming orders have slowed somewhat, but indications are that\nthere will be a stronger fourth quarter.\u201d (Plastics & Rubber\nProducts)  \u201cBusiness is slow right now. Companies seem to be holding onto\ntheir money.\u201d (Computer & Electronic Products)  \u201cWe can sense, feel and see headwinds with customer orders,\nespecially  Europe  related.\u201d (Apparel, Leather & Allied Products)  \u201cNew orders and backlog remain flat.\u201d (Miscellaneous\nManufacturing)  \u201cAuto industry slowing a bit in the second half [of the year].\u201d\n(Transportation Equipment)  \u201cU.S. drought severely impacting raw materials prices.\u201d (Food,\nBeverage & Tobacco Products)  \u201cLackluster demand continues in all regions of the world, and is\nsupporting much lower raw materials prices in the second half of\n2012.\u201d (Chemical Products)\nCOMMODITIES REPORTED UP/DOWN IN PRICE and IN SHORT SUPPLY\nCommodities Up in Price\nCaustic Soda; Corn (2); Corn Products; Corrugated Boxes; Freight\nRates; Fuel; Lead Batteries;  Natural Gas  (4); Plastic Components;\nSteel -- Carbon Sheet (3); and Steel -- Hot Rolled (2).\nCommodities Down in Price\nAluminum; Copper (3); Nickel; PET; Polypropylene Resin (3); Stainless\nSteel (2); Steel (6); and Steel -- Cold Rolled (3).\nCommodities in Short Supply\nNo items are reported in short supply.\nNote: The number of consecutive months the commodity is listed is\nindicated after each item.\nAUGUST 2012 MANUFACTURING INDEX SUMMARIES\nPMI\nManufacturing contracted in August as the PMI registered 49.6\npercent, a decrease of 0.2 percentage point when compared to July\u2019s\nreading of 49.8 percent. A reading above 50 percent indicates that\nthe manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent\nindicates that it is generally contracting.\nA PMI in excess of 42.6 percent, over a period of time, generally\nindicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the August\nPMI indicates growth for the 39th consecutive month in the overall\neconomy, but indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector for\nthe third time since July 2009, when the PMI registered 49.2 percent.\nHolcomb stated, \u201cThe past relationship between the PMI and the\noverall economy indicates that the average PMI for January through\nAugust (52.2 percent) corresponds to a 3.2 percent increase in real\ngross domestic product (GDP). In addition, if the PMI for August\n(49.6 percent) is annualized, it corresponds to a 2.4 percent\nincrease in real GDP annually.\u201d\nNew Orders\nISM\u2019s New Orders Index registered 47.1 percent in August, which is a\ndecrease of 0.9 percentage point when compared to the July reading of\n48 percent. This represents a contraction in new orders for the third\ntime since April 2009, when the New Orders Index registered 46.8\npercent. A New Orders Index above 52.3 percent, over time, is\ngenerally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau\u2019s series\non manufacturing orders (in constant 2000 dollars).\nThe four industries reporting growth in new orders in August are:\nApparel, Leather & Allied Products; Printing & Related Support\nActivities; Primary Metals; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products.\nThe 11 industries reporting a decrease in new orders during August --\nlisted in order -- are: Textile Mills; Furniture & Related Products;\nFabricated Metal Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; Transportation\nEquipment; Machinery; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components;\nPaper Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Computer & Electronic\nProducts; and Chemical Products.\nProduction\nISM\u2019s Production Index registered 47.2 percent in August, which is a\ndecrease of 4.1 percentage points when compared to the 51.3 percent\nreported in July. This indicates contraction in production for the\nfirst time since May 2009 when the Production Index registered 43.9\npercent. An index above 51.2 percent, over time, is generally\nconsistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Industrial\nProduction figures.\nThe four industries reporting growth in production during the month\nof August are: Printing & Related Support Activities; Primary Metals;\nComputer & Electronic Products; and Paper Products. The seven\nindustries reporting a decrease in production in August -- listed in\norder -- are: Textile Mills; Furniture & Related Products; Electrical\nEquipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment;\nMachinery; Fabricated Metal Products; and Apparel, Leather & Allied\nProducts. Seven industries reported no change in production in August\ncompared to July.\nEmployment\nISM\u2019s Employment Index registered 51.6 percent in August, which is\n0.4 percentage point lower than the 52 percent reported in July. This\nis the 35th consecutive month of growth in the Employment Index. An\nEmployment Index above 50.5 percent, over time, is generally\nconsistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)\ndata on manufacturing employment.\nOf the 18 manufacturing industries, nine reported growth in\nemployment in August in the following order: Printing & Related\nSupport Activities; Primary Metals; Petroleum & Coal Products; Food,\nBeverage & Tobacco Products; Paper Products; Fabricated Metal\nProducts; Machinery; Transportation Equipment; and Miscellaneous\nManufacturing. The five industries reporting a decrease in employment\nin August are: Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components;\nNonmetallic Mineral Products; Furniture & Related Products; Computer\n& Electronic Products; and Chemical Products.\n Supplier Deliveries \nThe delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations\nwas faster in August as the Supplier Deliveries Index registered 49.3\npercent, which is 0.6 percentage point higher than the 48.7 percent\nreported in July. This is the seventh consecutive month supplier\ndeliveries have been faster than the previous month, following 31\nconsecutive months in which supplier deliveries slowed. A reading\nabove 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.\nThe six industries reporting slower supplier deliveries in August --\nlisted in order -- are: Electrical Equipment, Appliances &\nComponents; Furniture & Related Products; Miscellaneous\nManufacturing; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; and\nPrimary Metals. The five industries reporting faster supplier\ndeliveries in August are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Plastics &\nRubber Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage &\nTobacco Products; and Fabricated Metal Products. Seven industries\nreported no change in supplier deliveries in August compared to July.\nInventories(b)\nThe Inventories Index registered 53 percent in August, which is 4\npercentage points higher than the 49 percent reported in July. This\nmonth\u2019s reading indicates that respondents are reporting inventories\nare growing for the first time since September 2011, when the\nInventories Index registered 52 percent. An Inventories Index greater\nthan 42.8 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion\nin the  Bureau of Economic Analysis \u2019 (BEA) figures on overall\nmanufacturing inventories (in chained 2000 dollars).\nThe nine industries reporting higher inventories in August -- listed\nin order -- are: Primary Metals; Plastics & Rubber Products;\nMachinery; Chemical Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; Furniture &\nRelated Products; Paper Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products;\nand Transportation Equipment. The five industries reporting decreases\nin inventories in August are: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products;\nTextile Mills; Computer & Electronic Products; Fabricated Metal\nProducts; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components.\nCustomers\u2019 Inventories(b)\nThe ISM Customers\u2019 Inventories Index registered 49 percent in August,\nwhich is 0.5 percentage point lower than in July when the index\nregistered 49.5 percent. Customers\u2019 inventories have registered at or\nbelow 50 percent for 41 consecutive months. A reading below 50\npercent indicates customers\u2019 inventories are considered too low.\nThe six manufacturing industries reporting customers\u2019 inventories as\nbeing too high during August -- listed in order -- are: Nonmetallic\nMineral Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components;\nFood, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; Fabricated\nMetal Products; and Primary Metals. The eight industries reporting\ncustomers\u2019 inventories as too low during August -- listed in order --\nare: Plastics & Rubber Products; Wood Products; Furniture & Related\nProducts; Transportation Equipment; Machinery; Miscellaneous\nManufacturing; Computer & Electronic Products; and Apparel, Leather &\nAllied Products.\nPrices(b)\nThe ISM Prices Index registered 54 percent in August, which is an\nincrease of 14.5 percentage points compared to the July reading of\n39.5 percent. This is the first month the index has reflected an\nincrease in the price of raw materials since April 2012 when the\nPrices Index registered 61 percent. This is also the largest month-\nover-month increase since September 2005, when the index increased\n15.5 percentage points from August 2005. In August, 23 percent of\nrespondents reported paying higher prices, 15 percent reported paying\nlower prices, and 62 percent of supply executives reported paying the\nsame prices as in July. A Prices Index above 49.4 percent, over time,\nis generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (BLS) Index of Manufacturers Prices.\nOf the 18 manufacturing industries, seven reported paying increased\nprices during the month of August in the following order: Nonmetallic\nMineral Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Food,\nBeverage & Tobacco Products; Furniture & Related Products; Chemical\nProducts; Paper Products; and Primary Metals. The four industries\nreporting paying lower prices during August are: Petroleum & Coal\nProducts; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Machinery; and Computer &\nElectronic Products. Seven industries reported no change in prices\npaid in August compared to July.\nBacklog of Orders(b)\nISM\u2019s Backlog of Orders Index registered 42.5 percent in August,\nwhich is 0.5 percentage point lower than the 43 percent reported in\nJuly. Of the 84 percent of respondents who reported their backlog of\norders, 16 percent reported greater backlogs, 31 percent reported\nsmaller backlogs, and 53 percent reported no change from July.\nThe three industries reporting increased order backlogs in August\nare: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Primary Metals; and Plastics\n& Rubber Products. The 10 industries reporting decreases in order\nbacklogs during August -- listed in order -- are: Textile Mills;\nPetroleum & Coal Products; Machinery; Furniture & Related Products;\nTransportation Equipment; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated\nMetal Products; Paper Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products;\nand Chemical Products.\nNew Export Orders(b)\nISM\u2019s New Export Orders Index registered 47 percent in August, which\nis 0.5 percentage point higher than the 46.5 percent reported in\nJuly, and represents the third month of contraction in the index\nsince June 2009, when the index registered 49.5 percent. Prior to\nthis current three-month period of contraction, the New Export Orders\nIndex had registered 50 percent or above for the past 35 consecutive\nmonths.\nThe five industries reporting growth in new export orders in August\nare: Fabricated Metal Products; Primary Metals; Electrical Equipment,\nAppliances & Components; Computer & Electronic Products; and Chemical\nProducts. The eight industries reporting a decrease in new export\norders during August -- listed in order -- are: Petroleum & Coal\nProducts; Furniture & Related Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing;\nTransportation Equipment; Machinery; Paper Products; Food, Beverage &\nTobacco Products; and Apparel, Leather & Allied Products.\nImports(b)\nISM\u2019s Imports Index registered 49 percent in August, which is 1.5\npercentage points lower than the 50.5 percent reported in July. This\nmonth\u2019s reading reflects the first month of contraction in imports\nsince November 2011 when the Imports Index also registered 49\npercent.\nThe eight industries reporting growth in imports during the month of\nAugust -- listed in order -- are: Wood Products; Nonmetallic Mineral\nProducts; Plastics & Rubber Products; Fabricated Metal Products;\nChemical Products; Primary Metals; Machinery; and Computer &\nElectronic Products. The seven industries reporting a decrease in\nimports during August -- listed in order -- are: Electrical\nEquipment, Appliances & Components; Petroleum & Coal Products; Paper\nProducts; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Furniture & Related\nProducts; Transportation Equipment; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco\nProducts.\n(b) The Inventories, Customers\u2019 Inventories, Prices, Backlog of\nOrders, New Export Orders and Imports Indexes do not meet the\naccepted criteria for seasonal adjustments.\nBuying Policy\nAverage commitment lead time for  Capital Expenditures  increased 15\ndays to 124 days. Average lead time for Production Materials\nincreased 1 day to 55 days. Average lead time for Maintenance, Repair\nand Operating (MRO) Supplies increased 1 day to 27 days.  About this Report\nThe data presented herein is obtained from a survey of manufacturing\nsupply managers based on information they have collected within their\nrespective organizations. ISM makes no representation, other than\nthat stated within this release, regarding the individual company\ndata collection procedures. Use of the data is in the public domain\nand should be compared to all other economic data sources when used\nin decision-making.\nData and Method of Presentation\nThe Manufacturing ISM Report On Business is based on data compiled\nfrom purchasing and supply executives nationwide. Membership of the\nManufacturing Business Survey Committee is diversified by NAICS,\nbased on each industry\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product\n(GDP). Manufacturing Business Survey Committee responses are divided\ninto the following NAICS code categories: Food, Beverage & Tobacco\nProducts; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Wood\nProducts; Paper Products; Printing & Related Support Activities;\nPetroleum & Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber\nProducts; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated\nMetal Products; Machinery; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical\nEquipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment;\nFurniture & Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing\n(products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting\ngoods, toys and office supplies).\nSurvey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month\ncompared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured\n(New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports,\nProduction, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Customers\u2019 Inventories,\nEmployment and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting\neach response, the net difference between the number of responses in\nthe positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for\nSupplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower,\nworse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index.\nResponses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index\nincludes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those\nresponding the same (considered positive).\nThe resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for\nseasonal adjustments (PMI, New Orders, Production, Employment and\nSupplier Deliveries) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the\neffects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from\nnormal differences in weather conditions, various institutional\narrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays.\nAll seasonal adjustment factors are supplied by the U.S. Department\nof Commerce and are subject annually to relatively minor changes when\nconditions warrant them. The PMI is a composite index based on the\ndiffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New\nOrders (seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted),\nEmployment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries (seasonally\nadjusted), and Inventories.\nDiffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are\nconvenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of\nchange and the scope of change. A PMI reading above 50 percent\nindicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding;\nbelow 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A PMI in\nexcess of 42.6 percent, over a period of time, indicates that the\noverall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally\nexpanding; below 42.6 percent, it is generally declining. The\ndistance from 50 percent or 42.6 percent is indicative of the\nstrength of the expansion or decline. With some of the indicators\nwithin this report, ISM has indicated the departure point between\nexpansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined\nby regression analysis.\nThe Manufacturing ISM Report On Business surveys are sent out to\nManufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of\neach month. Respondents are asked to ONLY report on information for\nthe current month. ISM receives survey responses throughout most of\nany given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting\nuntil late in the month to submit responses in order to give the most\naccurate picture of current business activity. ISM then compiles the\nreports for release on the first business day of the following month.\nThe industries reporting growth, as indicated in the Manufacturing\nISM Report On Business monthly reports, are listed in the order of\nmost growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction\nor decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of\ncontraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.\nResponses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current\nmonth\u2019s lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for\nwhich commitments are made for Production Materials; Capital\nExpenditures; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies,\nexpressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days,\nsix months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted\naverage number of days. These responses are raw data, never revised,\nand not seasonally adjusted since there is no significant seasonal\npattern.\nThe Manufacturing ISM Report On Business is published monthly by the\nInstitute for Supply Management, the first supply institute in the\nworld. Founded in 1915, ISM exists to lead and serve the supply\nmanagement profession and is a highly influential and respected\nassociation in the global marketplace. ISM\u2019s mission is to lead the\nsupply management profession through its standards of excellence,\nresearch, promotional activities and education. This report has been\nissued by the association since 1931, except for a four-year\ninterruption during World War II.\nThe full text version of the Manufacturing ISM Report On Business is\nposted on ISM\u2019s website at www.ism.ws on the first business day of\nevery month after 10:10 a.m. (ET).\nThe next Manufacturing ISM Report On Business featuring the September\n2012 data will be released at 10:00 a.m. (ET) on Monday, October 1,\n2012.
