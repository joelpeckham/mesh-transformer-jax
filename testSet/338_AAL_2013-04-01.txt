The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAnglo American Plc. (AAL)  said its biggest\nproject, the $8.8 billion Minas-Rio venture in Brazil, is 60\npercent complete as the London-based miner discusses terms of\nits port terminal agreement with  Eike Batista .  Anglo is in talks with Batista\u2019s  LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3)  to allow\nthe billionaire to open their jointly owned terminal at the Acu\nport in Rio de Janeiro state to other investments, Paulo Castellari, Anglo\u2019s head for iron ore in Brazil, said today. The\ncompany expects to sign \u201coperational agreements\u201d with LLX by\nJune, he said.  \u201cWe are in negotiations to see what else will be done\nthere,\u201d Castellari, 42, told reporters today during a meeting\nat the company\u2019s offices in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. \u201cWe have\npriority for 26.5 million tons and the right to expand, that\u2019s\nguaranteed,\u201d he said, declining to say what Anglo is asking\nBatista as compensation to allow the terminal for other uses.  Anglo said in January it would write down $4 billion on\nMinas-Rio and increase the iron-ore project\u2019s budget for a sixth\ntime after prior blowouts forced Chief Executive Officer Cynthia Carroll to quit. The venture has suffered licensing impediments\nand rising costs since Anglo bought it in 2008, leading to a\ndelay of at least four years to start production.  Minas-Rio, which includes a mine, processing plant and a\n525-kilometer pipeline to an iron-ore terminal at the Acu port\nin Rio state, will have an initial capacity of 26.5 million\nmetric tons a year. Anglo, which says the project contains at\nleast 8 billion tons of resources, expects to make the first\nshipment in late 2014.  Anglo continues talks with  Ternium SA (TX)  for an iron-ore\nsupply contract from Minas-Rio, Castellari said today, after\nsaying last year that an agreement would be signed by June 2012.  Anglo  dropped  1.7 percent in London on March 28 before the\nEaster break and has slumped 28 percent in the past 12 months.
