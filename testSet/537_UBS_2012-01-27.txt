The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChina \u2019s property prices need to\ndecline 30 percent to reach a \u201creasonable\u201d level, according to\nHe Keng, a deputy director of the Financial and Economic Affairs\nCommittee of the National People\u2019s Congress.  Housing prices will be at a \u201creasonable\u201d level when they\nare equivalent to about six years of salary for a family, the\nsenior lawmaker said, according to the transcript of an\ninterview with China National Radio.  \u201cBased on this, property prices may need to fall 30\npercent,\u201d He said, according to the transcript on the\nbroadcaster\u2019s website. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean prices will go down\nin every region, every city. The exact extent of the decline\nwill depend on demand.\u201d  China reiterated this year it won\u2019t back away from housing\ncurbs including tighter mortgage requirements, while Beijing and\nthe financial center of  Shanghai  are among Chinese cities that\nhave said they will continue imposing home purchase restrictions\nthis year. The nation\u2019s home prices had their worst performance\nin 2011 in December, with only two of the 70 cities tracked by\nthe government posting gains, according to data from the\nNational Statistics Bureau this month.  Home transactions will drop 10 percent in China this year,\naccording to Daiwa Securities Capital Markets, while UBS AG said\nthe curbs may boost supply to the highest in a decade.  Developers may be facing one of their toughest years in\n2012, Chen Li, head of China equity strategy at UBS, said\nearlier this month. Their  cash flow  may be \u201cexhausted to zero\u201d\nby the end of the year as some companies struggle to get\nfinancing for projects, Chen said.  Price Slide  Prices are starting to slide as government curbs begin to\ntake effect in less-affluent cities. In the eastern city of\nWenzhou, where a credit squeeze on smaller businesses prompted a\nvisit and pledge of financial aid from Premier  Wen Jiabao  in\nOctober, prices slid 1.9 percent in December from the previous\nmonth and 6.9 percent from a year earlier, according to the data.  Home sales last year rose 10 percent, the slowest pace\nsince 2008, according to data released on Jan. 17. In 2008,\nChina\u2019s home sales retreated for the first time since the 1998\nprivatization of the housing market, dropping 17 percent.  The government may ease property curbs as early as the\nmiddle of the year as an oversupply may be a \u201cdisaster\u201d for\ndevelopers, said UBS\u2019s Chen. Supply will peak at 1.5 times to\n1.6 times demand, Chen said.  A  measure  tracking property shares on the  Shanghai\nComposite Index (SHCOMP)  has climbed 6.7 percent since the start of the\nyear, the most among the five industry groups making up the\nbenchmark stock gauge.  --Winnie Zhu.
