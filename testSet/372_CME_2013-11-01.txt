 "context": "The following article called 'CBOT Traders Ask Court to Block Trade Settlement Rules' was published on 2013-11-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA group of  Chicago  Board of Trade\nbrokers and traders who practice the traditional method of\ncompleting trades with shouting and hand signals are asking an\n Illinois  judge to block new settlement rules they claim hurt\ntheir livelihoods.  A  change  that took effect in June 2012 introduced\nalgorithms that blend electronic trade information with the old-fashioned open pit outcry method for agricultural trade price\nsettlements.  That change \u201cwill, for all practical purposes, eliminate\nthe open outcry pit-based system in which the plaintiffs and\ntheir businesses trade,\u201d George Sang, a lawyer for about 20\nopponents of the new system, said in a filing in state court in\nChicago. He also said their rights as board shareholders were\nbeing violated.  Cook County Circuit Judge  Jean Prendergast Rooney  in\nChicago is scheduled today to start a four-day hearing on the\nchallenge to the new rules.  Besides the Board of Trade, defendants include its parent\ncompany, Chicago-based  CME Group Inc. (CME) , Chairman  Terrence Duffy \nand Chief Executive Officer Phupinder Gill.  Attorneys for the defense said in a court filing that the\nchange was made to ensure settlement prices reflect \u201cthe full\nbreadth\u201d of market activity.  Amend Rules  They also denied the claim by the group of brokers and\ntraders that the rule change breached their contractual rights,  \u201cCBOT, not its members, is empowered to make and amend its\nrules,\u201d the defense lawyers said.  Members only get a right to vote on those changes if\nthey\u2019re specifically enumerated in its certificate of\nincorporation, the defense attorneys said in a September 2012\ncourt filing.  The organization made the change to ensure the exchange is\n\u201cconsistent\u201d with the federal Commodity Exchange Act and with\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission requirements, CME Group\nspokeswoman Laurie Bischel said in a phone interview last year.  \u201cWe believe that the new settlement methodology accurately\ncaptures contract value across both open outcry and electronic\ntrading during the settlement period,\u201d she said, adding it is\n\u201cfully consistent\u201d with CME Group\u2019s functions as a designated\ncontract market and derivatives clearing organization.  While a state court judge previously handling the case, Lee Preston, last year denied the bulk of a defense request for\njudgment in their favor, he rejected the traders\u2019 breach of\ncontract claims against Duffy and Gill and breach of fiduciary\nduty claims against the corporate defendants.  The case is McKerr v. The Board of Trade of the City of\nChicago, 12CH23185, Cook County, Illinois, Circuit Court,\n Chancery Division  (Chicago).
