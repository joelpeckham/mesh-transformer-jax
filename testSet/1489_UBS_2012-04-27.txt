The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the\nfifth-largest U.S. bank, expanded its management team for Brazil\ninvestment banking, naming Daniel Wainstein chairman and adding\ntwo co-chief operating officers.  Antonio Pereira and Fabio Bicudo, previously managing\ndirectors at the New York-based company, were named co-COOs and\nWainstein, 42, who was head of the Brazil investment bank, will\nbecome chairman effective immediately, Stephen Scherr, Goldman\nSachs\u2019s chief for  Latin America  and global head of the\ninvestment bank\u2019s financing group, said in an interview.  \u201cWe have been expanding the team, and we need Daniel to\nhave more client engagement,\u201d Scherr said, adding that Goldman\nSachs has doubled the number of employees as revenue increased\nfrom the business in the past three years. Goldman Sachs has\nabout 300 people in  Brazil , Scherr said.  Pereira and Bicudo \u201cwill assist Daniel in the day-to-day\nmanagement tasks,\u201d freeing him up to develop client\nrelationships, Scherr said.  The firm, which doesn\u2019t disclose Brazil revenue or profit,\nlast month named Paulo Leme as chairman for the country. The\nfirm has said its strategy in Brazil is to focus on complex\nproducts with higher profit margins, such as convertible debt\nand receivables securitization.  U.S. and international banks are competing against Brazil-\nbased companies such as Banco Itau BBA SA and Banco BTG Pactual\nSA, which have used their stronger local contacts to squeeze out\nforeign firms.  Merger Advisers  Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t make the top 10 in any Brazil\ninvestment-banking category in 2009 or 2010, excluding\ninternational bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe firm was No. 8 among Brazil merger advisers last year, with\n$14.8 billion in deals, and ranks 10th this year for M&A, with\ntwo deals totaling $2.62 billion.  Goldman Sachs completed its strategy to become a full-\nservice bank in Brazil in 2009, after two failed attempts to buy\nlocal firms. In 1998, Goldman Sachs tried to buy Banco de\nInvestimentos Garantia SA, which was acquired by Credit Suisse\nGroup AG.  Seven years later it sought to purchase Banco Pactual SA,\nan investment bank later acquired by UBS AG. Pactual was sold\nback to BTG Partners in 2009 and is now Banco BTG Pactual SA.\nBTG went public this week in a $1.94 billion initial offering\nthat Goldman Sachs helped underwrite.
