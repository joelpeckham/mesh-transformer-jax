 "context": "The following article called 'Payday Lenders Seek U.S. Oversight to Avoid State Rules' was published on 2012-07-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Internet\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t-call-us-\npayday\u201d lenders are making a bid for more respect in  Washington \nand less control from state regulators.  Firms offering short-term online loans, including  Fort\nWorth , Texas-based  Cash America International Inc. (CSH) , are ramping\nup political contributions, hiring lobbyists and asking Congress\nto largely transfer oversight from states to the U.S. Office of\nthe Comptroller of the Currency. A House committee today will\nhold a hearing on the proposal, which the OCC itself opposes.  As the $11 billion online loan industry bulks up in\nWashington, it also aims to shed the \u201cpayday lenders\u201d label,\naccording to talking points drafted by Peter Barden, a spokesman\nfor the  Online Lenders Alliance .  The memo advised lenders making lobbying visits to  Capitol\nHill  this summer to \u201cavoid using the term \u2019payday.\u2019 Talk about\nshort-term, small-dollar lending.\u201d  Behind it all is more spending. The political action\ncommittee for Cash America is on pace to double its annual\ncampaign contributions from the $200,000 it gave in 2007,\naccording to federal election records, and the lender is\nbankrolling a new coalition to push for the legislation.  The core of the bill, sponsored by Representatives Blaine Luetkemeyer, a Missouri Republican, and Joe Baca, a California\nDemocrat, would give the OCC authority to designate lenders as\nNational Consumer Credit Corporations and require the regulator\nto treat storefront and online lenders equally.  Disclosure Rules  The OCC would be able to preempt state rules based on a\nlegal standard previously introduced by the Dodd-Frank\nregulatory overhaul. The lending bill, introduced July 18, also\nwould loosen the rules for how short-term lenders disclose the\ntotal cost of the loans to consumers.  Lenders are touting the proposal as a way to promote\nbusinesses that serve so-called underbanked Americans, who may\nnot be able to get small loans from traditional banks. The firms\nsay the changes would help them compete against Native American\ntribes and overseas lenders offering loans online.  \u201cOn the Internet you have a tremendous amount of\ncompetition that does not play by the rules that we do,\u201d Mary\nJackson, a senior vice president at Cash America, said in an\ninterview. State regulations are \u201ca competitive noose,\u201d she\nsaid.  For their part, state regulators see the bill as designed\nto dilute oversight of the industry, said John Ryan, head of the\nConference of State Banking Supervisors.  \u201cThis is an inherently local business with very local\neffects,\u201d Ryan said in an e-mail. \u201cThere needs to be local\naccountability and oversight.\u201d  Direct Debits  Representatives from Ryan\u2019s group, which includes overseers\nof banks as well as non-banks like payday lenders and finance\ncompanies, are set to testify at the House hearing.  Payday lending refers to small short-term loans originally\nmeant to tide someone over until their next paycheck. At a\nbrick-and-mortar lender, the loans typically are secured by a\npost-dated check. Online borrowers instead furnish a bank\naccount number for direct debits.  About 35 percent of the $32 billion in small-dollar loans\nmade in 2010 originated online and that share will grow to 62\npercent by 2016, according to a Jan. 9 report by John Hecht,\nthen an analyst with JMP Securities, a San Francisco-based\ninvestment bank.  Interest rates, measured as an annual percentage rate, can\nreach 521 percent, according to the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau. Consumer advocates have long argued that the\nbusiness can trap poorer borrowers in a cycle of debt as they\ntake out new loans to cover old ones.  Avoiding \u2019Payday\u2019  Criticism of payday lending has prompted some firms to\navoid the term. The trade group representing brick-and-mortar\npayday lenders calls itself the Community Financial Services\nAssociation, and in one state is organized as the Kentucky\nDeferred Deposit Association. Banks including  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) \nand  U.S. Bancorp (USB) , which offer similar products, refer to them as\n\u201cdirect deposit advances\u201d and \u201cchecking account advances.\u201d  Under the current regulatory system, states have\njurisdiction over consumer loans made within their borders. The\nDodd-Frank law gives the new Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau the ability to supervise, regulate and enforce rules on\nnon-bank financial companies. The bill introduced in Congress\nthis month would in effect give the OCC some joint authority\nwith the bureau.  In testimony prepared for today\u2019s hearing by a panel of the\nHouse Financial Services Committee, Grovetta Gardineer, the\ndeputy comptroller of the currency for compliance policy, said\nthe bill would \u201churt the very population of consumers it seeks\nto address.\u201d The small-dollar loans and other products that\nwould be offered under the new charter are \u201cmost prone to\nabuse\u201d and often targeted at minority populations, she said in\nthe statement.  \u2018Largely Extinguished\u2019  \u201cThese are products and services that the OCC has largely\nextinguished from the national banking system, and we would not\nsupport, license, nor charter an institution concentrating in\nthese services today,\u201d Gardineer said.  The legislation wouldn\u2019t apply to loans with a term of less\nthan 30 days. Since typical payday loans are for two weeks, the\nindustry maintains that the legislation isn\u2019t a payday loan\nbill.  Cash America\u2019s Jackson said that while the industry opposed\nthe exemption, Baca wouldn\u2019t otherwise support the bill. Baca\nspokesman John Lowery did not respond to an e-mail seeking\ncomment.  The bill also would exempt loans with terms under a year\nfrom the Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to post\nthe annualized percentage rate consumers are paying. Instead,\nlenders would be able to post the dollar cost of a loan as a\nfinance charge.  Price Tag  Jean Ann Fox, director of financial services for the\n Consumer Federation of America , said moving away from disclosing\nthe annual  interest rate  would deprive consumers of a \u201cstandard\nprice tag for credit\u201d that has worked well for over 40 years.\nShe called the carve-out for loans less than 30 days \u201ca\ndistinction without a difference.\u201d  \u201cTo make extremely expensive small-dollar loans with a\nfederal charter, all the lender would have to do is set the term\nfor 31 days,\u201d Fox said in an e-mail. \u201cThat is no problem for\nthe industry.\u201d  Cash America, which reported net income of $135 million on\nrevenues of $1.54 billion in 2011, has been expanding its online\npresence. An initial public offering of its Internet lending\nsubsidiary, Enova International Inc., is pending.  \u2018Bigger Platform\u2019  Jackson said that Cash America wants to \u201coperate on a\nbigger platform\u201d by lending nationwide. Right now, it only\noperates in states where it is licensed and its products are\nlegal under state law. She said competitors operating on Native\nAmerican reservations aren\u2019t following state laws and that state\nregulators have been unsuccessful in lawsuits to gain oversight.  Hecht, now a managing director with Stephens Inc., a  Little\nRock , Arkansas-based investment bank, said Cash America would\nbenefit from a market expansion because competition is\nrestraining growth in its online business.  \u201cThe slowdown reflects maturation and saturation in the\nmarket for online lending in the  United States ,\u201d Hecht said in\nan interview.  Besides increasing its political donations, Cash America\nhas retained Wright Andrews as a lobbyist, according to official\ndisclosures.  Andrews, now with the Washington firm Andrews & Andrews\nPLLC, previously represented the now-defunct Coalition for Fair\nand Affordable Lending, an association of subprime mortgage\nlenders that fought against tighter underwriting standards\nbefore the 2008 financial crisis. He did not respond to requests\nfor comment.  New Coalition  Cash America is also one of two companies behind the\ncreation of the Financial Services Innovation Coalition, a lobby\ngroup that registered with the Senate on April 1. It was formed\nto push for the bill, Barden, the online lenders spokesman who\nis a public relations consultant at Mercury/Clark & Weinstock,\nsaid in an e-mail.  The alliance, of which Cash America is a member, has also\nstepped up its lobbying, and worked to expand the size of the\nassociation, according to records and interviews.  It has offered cheaper memberships to newer firms as a way\nof expanding the group\u2019s size, Jer Ayler, president of Trihouse\nInc., a Las Vegas-based payday lending consultancy, said in an\ninterview.  The alliance\u2019s founder, Mark Curry, the head of Mission,\nKansas-based Geneva-Roth Ventures Inc., in 2007 bought a red-\nbrick townhouse near the U.S. Capitol. The alliance and other\ngroups use it for fundraisers, according to invitations\npublished by the Washington-based Sunlight Foundation.  \u201cSome of the politicians react to us,\u201d Ayler said. \u201cSome\ndon\u2019t want much attention over the fact that we\u2019re supporting\nthem.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nCarter Dougherty in Washington at \n cdougherty6@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Maura Reynolds \nat   mreynolds34@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JMP Group Inc was 4.111912250518799 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JMP Group Inc was ",
