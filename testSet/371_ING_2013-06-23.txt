 "context": "The following article called 'Saudi Arabia Aligns Weekend in Next Step Toward Opening Market' was published on 2013-06-23. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSaudi Arabia  will shift its weekend\nto Friday and Saturday starting next week, taking the biggest\nArab economy a step closer to opening its stock market to\nforeign investors.  Government ministries and monetary agencies will adopt the\nnew weekend from June 29, aligning Saudi Arabia with the other\nfive Gulf Cooperation Council countries, according to a  royal\ndecree  yesterday. The decision was taken based on \u201cthe economic\nposition of the kingdom and its international and regional\nobligations,\u201d it said. The Saudi weekend has been Thursday and\nFriday.  \u201cInvestors can read between the lines and see this as\nanother step towards opening up the market,\u201d Fadi Al Said,\nsenior  fund manager  at ING Investment Management in Dubai said\nby phone yesterday. \u201cIt\u2019s not official, but this is one of the\nthings Saudi needed to do to open the markets for foreign\ninvestors.\u201d  Deutsche Bank AG and HSBC Holdings Plc are among banks that\nhave predicted the kingdom\u2019s stock exchange, the largest in the\nregion with a  market value  of about $400 billion, may open to\nforeigners as early as next year amid rising demand for assets.\nSuch a move may attract as much as as $30 billion of inflows,\n John Burbank , founder of $3.7 billion San Francisco-based hedge\nfund Passport Capital LLC, said in February.  Non-resident foreign investors can currently only\nparticipate through share-swap transactions and exchange-traded\nfunds.  The  Tadawul All-Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.5 percent yesterday,\nbringing the advance for the year to 11 percent. That compares\nwith a surge of 42 percent for Dubai\u2019s benchmark index and 6.2\npercent for the MSCI World Index.  Morgan Stanley  Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG are among global\nbanks shifting regional equities bases to  Riyadh  in anticipation\nthe market will open up. MSCI Inc., whose gauges are tracked by\ninvestors managing about $7 trillion, last year resumed Saudi\ncoverage and said it would consider including the nation in\nfrontier or emerging-market indexes if it allows foreigners\ndirect access.  MSCI this month upgraded the  United Arab Emirates , the\nsecond-biggest Arab economy, and Qatar to emerging-market\nstatus. The index provider\u2019s decision \u201cputs additional pressure\non Saudi Arabia to accelerate its qualified investor program and\nwe now believe this is likely over summer,\u201d Emad Mostaque, a\nLondon-based strategist at Noah Capital Markets EMEA Ltd., said\nJune 12.  \u201cOpening up to foreigners is mostly about regulation,\u201d\nTariq Qaqish, head of asset management at Dubai-based Al Mal\nCapital PSC, said by phone yesterday, adding that changing\nregulation in the country can take years. Still, the weekend\nshift \u201cis definitely a step forward,\u201d he said.  CMA Moves  The kingdom has taken other steps in recent months. In\nFebruary Mohammad Al-Sheikh, a World Bank executive representing\nSaudi Arabia, was appointed as chairman of the Capital Market\nAuthority. In April the CMA announced a plan to issue credit\nratings for local companies, and in May issued a resolution to\nadopt a stock price fluctuation limit of 10 percent for shares\non their first trading day. The same month it proposed new\nprocedures for companies with losses at or exceeding 50 percent\nof their capital.  Saudi\u2019s weekend switch will \u201cput an end to negative\neffects and lost economic opportunities\u201d from having different\nworking days than regional and international institutions, the\nSaudi Press Agency said, citing the royal decree. Weekend\nchanges for schools and educational institutions will start in\nthe next academic year.  The decision \u201cwill make the Saudi market more aligned with\nregional markets,\u201d John Sfakianakis, chief investment\nstrategist at MASIC, a Riyadh-based  investment company , said by\nphone yesterday.
