The Romney-Ryan plan calls for future beneficiaries to be\ngiven fixed amounts of money to buy health coverage, and polls\nshowed Medicare to be the third most crucial issue for voters\nin the three states, the NYT said.  Polling revealed about 60 percent of those questioned want\nMedicare to continue providing cover for older citizens as it\ndoes now, and see it as providing good value for money, the\nnewspaper reported.  Some 60 percent of independent voters in the three states\nwant to maintain Medicare as it is today, with 80 percent of\nregistered Democrats also in favor; Republican voters are\nclosely divided in Florida and Ohio although a majority in\nRyan\u2019s home state of Wisconsin support the changes, the NYT\nsaid.
