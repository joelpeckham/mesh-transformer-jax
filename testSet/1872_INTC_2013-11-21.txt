 "context": "The following article called 'ARM Sees Shift to Cheaper Smartphones Boosting Chip Royalty' was published on 2013-11-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nARM Holdings Plc (ARM) , the U.K. chip\ndesigner whose products power  Apple Inc. (AAPL) \u2019s iPhones, predicts a\nshift in demand toward lower-priced smartphones will help boost\nroyalty revenue.  \u201cThere is a shift advantage for ARM as mid-range and entry\nsmartphones drive smartphone growth. We\u2019ve got that dynamic\ngoing into next year,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said\nat a conference in  Barcelona  yesterday. \u201cThose phones generate\nmuch more royalty for ARM because they use more silicon.\u201d  ARM has had five consecutive years of  revenue growth  as its\ndesigns for chips that control graphics and processing were used\nin increasingly popular smartphones and tablets. Royalty\npayments took the spotlight last quarter as they missed\nanalysts\u2019 estimates. ARM shares have fallen almost 9 percent\nsince the earnings report on Oct. 22.  \u201cAs ARM technology becomes more sophisticated, the royalty\npercentage goes up,\u201d Score said. \u201cOn average, it\u2019s going to\nvery gradually go up.\u201d  Global smartphone shipments surged 40 percent last quarter,\nslowing from 53 percent growth for the previous three-month\nperiod, according to researcher IDC. The average selling prices\nof the devices fell by 13 percent to $317 from a year earlier,\nbecause of demand for more affordable handsets.  In spite of concerns about slowing growth, especially in\nChina, Score said ARM can continue expanding its customer base\nand outperforming the semiconductor market in the next five\nyears, driven by cheaper handsets, enterprise networking and\nmicro-controllers.  ARM shares fell less than 1 percent to 953.50 pence at 9:16\na.m. in  London .  New Chief  Chief Executive Officer Simon Segars, who succeeded Warren East in July, is confronting a shift in the industry\u2019s growth to\nlow-end smartphones and new entrant  Intel Corp. (INTC) , which has begun\ndesigning its own chips for mobile phones. ARM, based in\nCambridge, England, is also seeking to boost its market share in\nservers as companies from  Facebook Inc. (FB)  to  Google Inc. (GOOG)  look for\nlower-power machines to drive their data centers.  It\u2019s \u201cpossible to identify such a market and build a chip\nspecifically for that market, whether it is to handle only\nstorage or only video loading, for example. We can make the chip\nmuch more efficient,\u201d Score said at the annual Technology,\nMedia and Telecoms Conference organized by Morgan Stanley.  \u201cEveryone knows Intel has a very strong ecosystem around\nservers, we\u2019re not kidding ourselves,\u201d Score said. \u201cFor that\nreason we see it as further out.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMarie Mawad in Barcelona at \n mmawad1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Kenneth Wong  at \n kwong11@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Intel Corporation was 19.692466735839844 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Intel Corporation was ",
