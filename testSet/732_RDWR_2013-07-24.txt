(NOC) \nare among contractors competing for as much as $6 billion in\ncontracts that the U.S. Department of  Homeland Security  plans to\naward as early as this month for an unclassified program to\nprotect federal, state and local agencies\u2019 computer networks.\nRadware is joining with larger companies to take part in the\nbids, Howard Teicher, a vice president for the public sector for\nRadware, said in an interview July 18.  \u201cThe company\u2019s got some interesting technology that is\ngaining share in the U.S.,\u201d Alex Henderson, an analyst at\nNeedham & Co. in New York who rates Radware hold, said by phone\nyesterday. \u201cIt would make sense for Radware to be partnering\nwith some of these players.\u201d  The program follows an executive order from President\n Barack Obama  made in February, which directed the DHS to ensure\nthat unclassified government networks are scanned for threats\nand defended from attacks. As many as five companies will be\ngiven contracts by the  General Services Administration ,\naccording to a request for bids.

The\ncompany received 30 percent of its  revenue  from the region last\nyear.  \u201cLast quarter the company missed the numbers and they set\nthe bar really low for the June quarter because of it,\u201d\nHenderson said. \u201cIf they miss again in Europe in the June\nquarter, then they\u2019ve got a structural problem in the sales\nforce and they\u2019re going to need to fix it.\u201d  Partner, Gazit  Radware announced its first buyback since 2011 on April 25\nafter almost doubling cash and equivalents to $209.3 million in\nthe three years to the end of 2012, according to data compiled\nby Bloomberg.
