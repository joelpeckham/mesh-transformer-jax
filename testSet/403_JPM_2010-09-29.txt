 "context": "The following article called 'Self-Storage May See European Property's Biggest Profit Growth' was published on 2010-09-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBritish companies that rent out\nspace to store your old exercise bikes and rusty golf clubs may\noffer the best earnings growth among European property stocks as\nthey cut vacancies that mounted in the  housing slump .  A pickup in storage occupancy and rental rates in recent\nmonths suggests that  Safestore Holdings Plc ,  Big Yellow Group\nPlc  and  Lok\u2019nStore Group Plc  may be past the worst following an\nill-timed expansion push, according to  Paul Pulze , an analyst at\nEvolution Securities in London.  \u201cIf the economy starts to improve and the companies can\ndrive demand for the product, there\u2019s significant upside\nrelative to other real estate,\u201d said Pulze, who has a \u201cbuy\u201d\nrecommendation on  Safestore  and a \u201cneutral\u201d for  Big Yellow .  Safestore and Big Yellow, the two biggest U.K. storage\nchains, only need their facilities to be 40 percent full to\nbreak even, and any additional space leased is pure profit. That\nhas helped convince analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley that the shares may\noutperform in an industry plagued by prospects of stagnant rents\nand property values.  A 1 percentage point improvement in Big Yellow\u2019s annual\naverage occupancy would lift  earnings per share  by 6 percent,\nwhile a 1 point increase in the average rental rate increases\nearnings by 3 percent, according to  Bianca Riemer , an analyst at\nMorgan Stanley who rates Big Yellow \u201coverweight.\u201d  The typical large self-storage facility is a multistory\nwarehouse located near a main road. The several hundred cubicles\ninside can be as small as 6 square feet or as large as a tennis\ncourt. Two-thirds of customers are private individuals, ranging\nfrom EBay Inc. traders to people in the process of moving.  Expansion Spree  Companies embarked on an expansion spree that lifted the\nnumber of stores by 36 percent from 2006 to 2008, according to\nmembers of the  Self Storage Association , the body that\nrepresents the U.K.\u2019s 350 million-pound ($550 million) industry.  Average annual rental rates then fell 2.8 percent in 2009\nto 20.49 pounds a square foot. Big Yellow said occupancy at its\n32 oldest stores dropped to 69 percent at the end of March from\n84 percent at the peak of the U.K. housing boom three years ago.  Safestore said on Aug. 31 that occupancy at stores across\nthe U.K. and Paris rose by 3 points to 59 percent in the three\nmonths through July. Average rents climbed 3.5 percent from a\nyear earlier to 25.17 pounds a square foot.  Investors haven\u2019t shared analysts\u2019 enthusiasm. Safestore,\nBig Yellow and Lok\u2019nStore have declined an average 8.3 percent\nin the past 12 months, exceeding the 3.2 percent slide for the\n FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.   That probably reflects concern that few people can move to\nnew homes in a real-estate market hobbled by curtailed mortgage\nlending, said  Michael Burt , a London-based analyst at Execution\nNoble. He expects occupancy levels may grow at half the rate\nsome other analysts are predicting.  \u2018You Are Gambling\u2019  \u201cIf you are looking for a huge jump in earnings per share,\nyou are gambling on  mortgage approvals ,\u201d Burt said. He has a\n\u201cbuy\u201d rating on Safestore and a \u201csell\u201d on Big Yellow.  Since the self-storage industry started in the U.K. in the\nearly 1980s, about 800 facilities have opened offering the\nequivalent of 0.52 square foot for every Briton, the most in\nEurope.  That\u2019s still less than the 7.4 feet of storage available to\neach American or the 1.1 foot per Australian, reflecting the\nindustry\u2019s growth potential. The U.K. also has the oldest\nhousing stock in Europe and the smallest average room sizes,\naccording to European Union statistics.  More Stuff  \u201cCurrent housing doesn\u2019t reflect the need for more storage\nbecause we have so much more stuff,\u201d said Simon Nicol, director\nof housing at the  Building Research Establishment , a Watford,\nEngland-based nonprofit consulting body.  The storage companies are taking various measures to drive\nsales, in addition to trying to sell more insurance, packing\nmaterials and other accessories, which account for about 15\npercent of revenue.  Safestore has targeted partnerships with large corporations,\nincluding supermarket chain Tesco Plc and EBay, while Big Yellow\nconcentrated on developing its brand through distinctive yellow\nfacilities in prominent locations in the London area.  \u201cWe have spent 10 years building the kit and the\noperational platform and now it\u2019s a question of filling them,\u201d\n James Gibson , Big Yellow\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an\ninterview. \u201cIt does require an element of patience.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Simon Packard  in London at \n packard@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAndrew Blackman at   ablackman@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 28.73286247253418 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
