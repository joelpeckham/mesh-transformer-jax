 "context": "The following article called 'Starwood to Spin Off Home-Rental Division Into New REIT' was published on 2013-10-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStarwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD)  said it\nwill spin off its single-family rental-home unit into a real\nestate investment trust headed by Waypoint Real Estate Group\u2019s\nmanagement division, which is being acquired in the deal.  The spinoff, Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust, held $750\nmillion in 4,268 homes and non-performing loans on 1,549\nproperties as of Sept. 30, Starwood Property said in a statement\ntoday. The new REIT will receive $100 million in cash from its\nparent, a $400 million line of credit and no debt, which will\nposition it to be the second-largest publicly traded single-family rental REIT by portfolio value, according to Starwood\nProperty Chairman  Barry Sternlicht .  \u201cWe\u2019re buying $50 million to $60 million homes a month and\nthe baby is getting a little large -- like Moby-Dick,\u201d\nSternlicht said in a telephone interview today. \u201cWith Waypoint,\nwe\u2019ll have best-in-class management that has capability proven\nto get to scale.\u201d  Wall Street-backed investors have been racing to buy houses\nas  prices , which fell as much as 35 percent from their 2006\npeak, are rising at their fastest pace in seven years. Demand\nfor rental homes is growing from millions of households that\nwent through  foreclosure  or can\u2019t qualify for a mortgage.  Sternlicht, 52, will be chairman of the new company, which\nhe expects to begin trading publicly on the  New York  Stock\nExchange under the ticker SWAY in February. Gary Beasley and\nDoug Brien, Waypoint\u2019s current co-chief executive officers, will\nserve as co-CEOs of the new company.  Sternlicht, whose Greenwich, Connecticut-based Starwood\nCapital Group has $26.3 billion under management, began\ninvesting in distressed real estate after the 1980s savings-and-loan crisis. Starwood Property is a REIT managed by a Starwood\nCapital affiliate.  Starwood\u2019s Strength  Waypoint, an Oakland, California-based landlord with about\n5,000 properties, filed for an initial public offering as a REIT\nin May, just as investor interest in housing-related stocks\nsuffered following a spike in  mortgage rates . The new company is\na way for Waypoint to go public using Starwood\u2019s strength as a\nsource for capital, Beasley said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to find a way to build a big\nplatform,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cReally, the only\nthing that\u2019s been missing for us is capital.\u201d  Beasley and Sternlicht declined to say how much Starwood\npaid for Waypoint.  Shares of three publicly traded single-family rental REITs\n-- American Homes 4 Rent, the largest publicly traded house REIT\nwith 20,000 homes, American Residential Properties Inc. and\nSilver Bay Realty Trust Corp. -- are trading below their initial\nprices.  Market \u2018Wrong\u2019  \u201cOur bet here is that the public market is wrong,\u201d\nSternlicht said. \u201cLong-term we can create in-scale, lasting\nassets in the public market that will pay a current yield higher\nthan those of other REITs and will have home price appreciation\nat least equivalent to that in other commercial real estate.\u201d  Private-equity firms,  hedge funds  and REITs have raised\nmore than $20 billion in the past two years to acquire as many\nas 200,000 rental homes.  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest\nlandlord with about $7.5 billion spent on 40,000 houses, started\nshopping the first-ever U.S. bonds backed by rental homes to\ninvestors this week.  Waypoint started in 2009 as one of the first investors in\nsingle-family homes, developing software and management\nattractive to Starwood. Waypoint will continue to manage its\nproperties, which are owned by 11 different funds, after the\nacquisition, Beasley said.  Waypoint has \u201ctechno wizards\u201d who have developed systems\nto value properties being considered for acquisition and manage\nthem more efficiently than Starwood\u2019s current set-up, which\nrelies on outside companies, Sternlicht said.  \u201cI knew to go to  Florida  and I knew more or less where we\nwanted to go,\u201d Sternlicht said. Waypoint \u201ccan tell me what\nstreet I should buy in  Orlando .\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJohn Gittelsohn in  Los Angeles  at \n johngitt@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nKara Wetzel at \n kwetzel@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Starwood Property Trust Inc. was 10.072829246520996 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Starwood Property Trust Inc. was ",
