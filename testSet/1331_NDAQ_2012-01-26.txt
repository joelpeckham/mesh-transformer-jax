 "context": "The following article called 'Nasdaq\u2019s Greifeld Says Not Interested in LSE, NYSE Bids' was published on 2012-01-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  isn\u2019t\ninterested in buying the  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  or\nanother attempt at  NYSE Euronext (NYX) , even as antitrust regulators\nrecommend against  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) \u2019s bid for the owner of the\nNew York Stock Exchange, Chief Executive Officer  Robert Greifeld \nsaid.  Nasdaq OMX, which made a failed hostile bid for NYSE\nEuronext in April, doesn\u2019t want the LSE, Greifeld told reporters\ntoday in Davos, Switzerland. He said later that he wouldn\u2019t\nconsider a second attempt at NYSE Euronext because the U.S.\nJustice Department rejected the idea.  Should  NYSE Euronext\u2019s deal  with Deutsche Boerse in\n Frankfurt  be blocked, it would mean $37 billion in exchange\nmergers announced since October 2010 failed to close, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg. LSE shares have rallied almost\n twice  the Bloomberg World Exchanges Index since European Union\nregulators told NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse  in December\ntheir concessions weren\u2019t enough to allay antitrust concerns.  \u201cThe one thing I know is we will not be making a run\u201d for\nNYSE Euronext, Greifeld told CNBC today. \u201cWe attempted it, the\nDOJ said no. We listen to the U.S. government, so we carry on.\u201d  December Meeting  NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are unlikely to garner\nenough support from European Union commissioners to overturn a\nlooming veto over their plan to create the world\u2019s largest\nexchange, four people familiar with the situation said this\nweek. EU regulators told the two companies that they planned to\nprohibit the deal because it would monopolize derivatives\ntrading in the region, according to two people familiar with the\ndraft decision in December.  Nasdaq OMX  joined  with IntercontinentalExchange Inc. in\nApril to offer $11.3 billion for the operator of the  New York \nStock Exchange, an attempt to counter Deutsche Boerse\u2019s $9.5\nbillion all-stock bid two months earlier. U.S. regulators\nthreatened to block Nasdaq and ICE\u2019s deal in May, and they\ndropped it. LSE has jumped 6.8 percent since then.  Greifeld has twice tried and failed to buy LSE, both times\ntaking his offer directly to shareholders after he was rebuffed\nby Clara Furse, then chief executive of LSE at the time. His\nlack of interest today is a shift from his position in June,\nwhen asked whether he was interested in combining with LSE or\nTMX Group Inc. in Toronto, Greifeld replied: \u201cAs I said: we\ntalk to many people. We have serious conversations with a few.\nThey would have to fall into the \u2018many\u2019 category.\u201d  LSE has rallied 13 percent since regulators signaled they\u2019d\nstop the NYSE-Deutsche Boerse deal. Nasdaq OMX is up 6.6 percent\nto $26. The Bloomberg World Exchanges Index advanced 7.2 percent\nin the same time.
