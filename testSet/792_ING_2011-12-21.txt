 "context": "The following article called 'ECB to Lend Greater-Than-Forecast $645 Billion as Banks Line Up for Funds' was published on 2011-12-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  European Central Bank  will lend\neuro-area banks a record amount for three years in its latest\nattempt to keep credit flowing to the economy during the\nsovereign debt crisis.  The Frankfurt-based ECB awarded 489 billion euros ($645\nbillion) in 1,134-day loans today, the most ever in a single\noperation and more than economists\u2019 median estimate of 293\nbillion euros in a Bloomberg News survey. The ECB said 523 banks\nasked for the funds, which will be lent at the average of its\n benchmark interest rate  -- currently 1 percent -- over the\nperiod of the loans. They start tomorrow.  \u201cIt was obviously an offer the banks could not refuse,\u201d\nsaid  Laurent Fransolet , head of fixed-income strategy at\n Barclays Capital  in London. \u201cIt shows the ECB is not out of\nammunition and it gives banks security on liquidity for a few\nyears. On the other hand it means banks will rely on the ECB for\nlonger.\u201d  Europe \u2019s debt crisis has increased the risk of government\nand bank defaults, making institutions wary of lending to each\nother and driving up the cost of credit. The ECB is trying to\nensure that banks have access to cheap cash for the medium term\nso that they can keep lending to companies and households. In\naddition to the longer-term loans, the ECB has widened the pool\nof collateral banks can use to secure the funds.  New Money  Barclays estimates today\u2019s operation will inject 193\nbillion euros of new money into the system, with 296 billion\neuros accounted for by maturing loans. The ECB also lent banks\n$33 billion for 14 days in a regular dollar offering, up from\n$5.1 billion a week ago, and 29.7 billion euros for 98 days.  The euro jumped half a cent to $1.3198 before retreating to\n$1.3092 at 1:25 p.m. in  Frankfurt .  \u201cMore important than the size of the operation is what\nbanks do with this cash,\u201d said  Simon Smith , chief economist at\nforeign-exchange broker FXPro Group Ltd. in London. \u201cThe\ndichotomy between size and use explains why the euro struggled\nto maintain its initial positive reaction to the news.\u201d  Spanish two-year notes extended a decline, snapping an\neight-day gain and sending yields 14 basis points higher to 3.49\npercent. Italian notes also dropped, pushing the yield 29 basis\npoints higher to 5.27 percent.  \u2018Through the Backdoor\u2019  Yields on  government bonds  in Italy and  Spain  fell in the\ndays after the ECB announced the loans on Dec. 8 as banks bought\nthe securities to use them as collateral in today\u2019s tender.\nFrench President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has suggested banks could use\nthe loans to buy even more government debt.  Simon Derrick , chief currency strategist at Bank of New\nYork Mellon Corp, said the loans amount to quantitative easing\n\u201cthrough the backdoor.\u201d  \u201cWhat the ECB is doing is providing ultra-cheap money to\nbanks, which in turn are going to be in there buying the\nsovereign debt up,\u201d Derrick told Linzie Janis on Bloomberg\nTelevision\u2019s \u201cFirst Look\u201d earlier today. \u201cThat\u2019s good news in\nthe sense that it\u2019s clearly going to help sovereigns in the near\nfuture, but it\u2019s also printing more money. That\u2019s going to start\nto weigh on the euro over time.\u201d  Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Group in Amsterdam,\nsaid banks are more likely to use the loans to \u201cfinance credit\nto the private sector or to repay maturing bank debt.\u201d  \u201cWe doubt whether the money will be used extensively to\nfund purchases of peripheral debt,\u201d he said.  Refinancing Needs  ECB Vice President  Vitor Constancio  in a Dec. 19 interview\npredicted \u201csignificant\u201d demand for the loans as banks face\n\u201cvery high refinancing needs early next year.\u201d  Some 230 billion euros of bank bonds mature in the first\nquarter of 2012 alone, ECB President  Mario Draghi  told the\nEuropean Parliament this week.  \u201cBanks represent about 80 percent of lending to the euro\narea,\u201d Draghi said. \u201cThe banking channel is crucial to the\nsupply of credit.\u201d He predicted banks will experience \u201cvery\nsignificant funding constraints\u201d for the \u201cwhole\u201d of 2012.  Banks from the 17-nation euro region need to refinance 35\npercent more debt next year than they did this year, according\nto a  Bank of England  study. Lenders have more than 600 billion\neuros of debt maturing in 2012, around three quarters of which\nis unsecured, the study says.  Focus on Banks  The ECB is focusing on greasing the banking system to fight\nthe debt crisis as it resists calls to increase its  bond\npurchases  to reduce governments\u2019 borrowing costs. Today\u2019s\nlending exceeded the 442 billion euros awarded in the ECB\u2019s\ninaugural 12-month loan in 2009.  The ECB said 123 banks shifted a total of 45.7 billion\neuros into the three-year loan from an existing one-year\nfacility allotted in October. The central bank will offer a\nsecond three-year loan on Feb. 28 and borrowers have the option\nof repaying the funds after a year.  \u201cIt\u2019s very significant and very helpful for the banks,\u201d\n Jacques Cailloux , chief European economist at Royal Bank of\nScotland Group Plc in  London , told Bloomberg Television. \u201cBut\nit\u2019s not going to bring about a turning point in this crisis.\u201d  As long as Europe\u2019s leaders fail to agree on the right\npolicy mix, which should include sovereign-debt restructuring or\na move to common bonds, the ECB\u2019s measures won\u2019t end the\nturmoil, Cailloux said.
