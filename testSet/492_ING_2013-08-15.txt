The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGerman property prices rose by the\nmost in a year in the second quarter as more residents bought\nhomes and office investment increased amid tight supply.  Prices for houses, apartments and residential buildings\nclimbed 4.1 percent from a year earlier, according to an index\npublished by the  VDP Association of German Pfandbrief Banks \ntoday. The office-price index rose 5.6 percent, giving both\nmeasures their best gain since the second quarter of 2012.  \u201cPrice developments in German residential property are\nstill being determined by large cities and university towns,\u201d\nJens Tolckmitt, VDP\u2019s general manager, said in a statement.\n\u201cRising populations and a growing number of households there\nare leading to continuous demand.\u201d  Housing demand in cities such as Berlin and  Frankfurt  is\noutpacing construction as young workers move to areas where jobs\nare easier to find. Office prices are being pushed higher by\ninstitutions seeking a safe investment as the euro area  went\nthrough a record-long recession that only ended in the last\nquarter.  Commercial-property investments in  Germany , Europe\u2019s\nlargest economy, reached 12.5 billion euros ($16.6 billion) in\nthe first half, the most since 2008, according to data compiled\nby London-based broker  Savills Plc. (SVS)   Prices for owner-occupied apartments rose 6 percent and\nresidential-building prices gained 4.9 percent, driven by a 4.6\npercent increase in rents paid on new leases, VDP said.  VDP collects price data from mortgage contracts signed\nacross Germany by its 38 member banks, which include Deutsche\nBank AG, Commerzbank AG,  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  ING Groep NV. (INGA) \nThe data includes information from all cities, regardless of\ntheir size, in which members made loans. By comparison, other\nGerman property indexes are based on prices and rents in only\nthe largest cities.
