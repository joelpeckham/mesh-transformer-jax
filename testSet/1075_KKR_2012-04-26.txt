 "context": "The following article called 'Rubenstein Said to Tell Investors Carlyle Is a Discount' was published on 2012-04-26. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCarlyle Group LP (CG)  co-founder  David Rubenstein  told investors he agreed to seek an initial public\noffering at a discount to rivals, to prove that shares in\nprivate-equity firms can rise, according to a person present at\nthe meeting.  Rubenstein, speaking yesterday at a meeting in New York\nwhere the founders were trying to win over prospective\nshareholders for the company\u2019s planned IPO next month, said\ninvestors come first at Carlyle and the firm considers\nshareholders investors as well, said the person, who asked not\nto be named because the information was private.  Christopher Ullman, a Carlyle spokesman, declined to\ncomment.  Carlyle, the world\u2019s second-biggest buyout firm by assets\nunder management, is seeking to raise as much as $762.5 million\nin its IPO, valuing the firm at as much as $7.6 billion, about\nhalf the $14.9 billion market capitalization of  Blackstone Group\nLP (BX) , the biggest private-equity company, and below the $9.6\nbillion value of  KKR & Co. (KKR)  Washington-based Carlyle, which has\nconsidered an IPO since at least 2007, is the last of the three\nfirms to go public.  Most of the biggest firms have lost money for shareholders.\nBlackstone, which sold stock just before the financial crisis\nfroze credit markets in 2007, has declined more than half from\nits IPO price of $31, falling 1.3 percent yesterday to $13.20.\n Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK) , which went public at $43 a share this\nmonth, has since lost 8.5 percent to $39.35.  Carlyle\u2019s Pitch  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , which went public in March of\nlast year, has declined 30 percent.  Leon Black , the firm\u2019s chief\nexecutive officer, said earlier this year that Apollo had a\n\u201cmiserable\u201d timing for its initial public offering as Europe\u2019s\nsovereign-debt crisis fueled market volatility.  Carlyle is seeking a valuation of about 10 times after-tax\ndistributable earnings, Rubenstein said. That\u2019s about a third\nlower than the typical multiple for competitors, he said.  The firm, which is offering 30.5 million shares at $23 to\n$25 each, was trying to convince analysts as recently as last\nyear that it\u2019s worth at least as much as Blackstone, a person\nbriefed on the matter said at the time.  Carlyle\u2019s founders are traveling from Montreal to Milan in\na 14-day world tour to pitch potential investors on the firm\u2019s\nIPO. Rubenstein,  William Conway  and  Daniel D\u2019Aniello  are each\nleading teams of Carlyle\u2019s top executives, according to a copy\nof the roadshow schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  \u201cBy many measures, we are the largest and most diversified\nalternative-asset manager in the world with 1,300 professionals\nin 33 offices on six continents,\u201d D\u2019Aniello said in a video of\nits pre-IPO marketing presentation posted on RetailRoadShow.com.\n\u201cWe live and invest in both developed and developing markets\nand, in both, local market presence really matters.\u201d  Carlyle is scheduled to price its IPO on May 2, according\nto data compiled by Bloomberg.
