 "context": "The following article called 'Energy Week Ahead: Clinton, Gates Give Chu Cover on Clean Energy' was published on 2012-02-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMicrosoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chairman  Bill Gates \nand former President  Bill Clinton  are lending their political\nclout to the Energy Department\u2019s research projects just as\nRepublicans question federal funding of the program.  The department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy\nholds its \u201cEnergy Innovation Summit\u201d today through Feb. 29 at\nthe National Harbor complex south of the U.S. Capitol. Energy\nSecretary Steven Chu and  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer Frederick Smith are among speakers at the\nconvention, which draws companies awarded U.S. funding for\nenergy research.  High-profile support from Clinton and Gates may be a poke\nin the eye to House Republicans, who criticize Chu\u2019s budget and\neffectiveness. President Barack Obama is seeking a 27 percent\nbump in funding for ARPA-E, to $350 million, from last year.\nSince September, the department canceled six ARPA-E projects\nthat won a combined $14.1 million for clean-energy research,\nthough $3.7 million was returned to the Treasury.  \u201cThe fact that several projects are not panning out is not\nsurprising, given the lack of accountability or clear direction\nfor these dollars,\u201d Representative  Fred Upton , a Michigan\nRepublican and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce\nCommittee, said in a Feb. 14 statement.  The research agency will award $30 million for projects to\ndevelop lightweight fuel tanks for natural gas-powered vehicles,\nthe Energy Department announced Feb. 23.  Internet Model  ARPA-E, modeled after a Defense Department program that\ndeveloped the Internet, puts seed money behind potentially\nrevolutionary energy projects. By nature, some will fail, say\nprogram backers. Breakthroughs may reduce dependence on foreign\noil, reduce  carbon emissions  and keep the U.S. at the cutting\nedge of clean-energy technology.  Investments that didn\u2019t pan out are a sliver of ARPA-E\u2019s\nspending. In September the agency awarded $156 million for 60\nprojects such as  energy storage  and electric-grid efficiency.\nRecipients include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and\n General Electric Co. (GE)  The Energy Department says 11 funded\ncompanies attracted a combined $200 million from private\ninvestors.  \u201cWe think this is money very well spent,\u201d Chu said of\nARPA-E at a Feb. 14 budget briefing.  ALSO WORTH WATCHING:  EPA ARGUMENTS: Miners, utilities and manufacturers get two days\nin court this week to argue for repeal of Environmental\nProtection Agency decisions tied to controlling greenhouse-gas\nemissions. The Coalition for Responsible Regulation Inc.,\n Peabody Energy Co. (BTU) , the National Mining Association, the\nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\nare among challengers to the EPA\u2019s 2009 finding that greenhouse\ngases threaten public health. Arguments will be held tomorrow\nand Feb. 29 in the U.S. Appeals Court for the  District of\nColumbia .  FRACKING RICHES: Fracking for natural gas in southeast Ohio will\nbe discussed at a hearing in Steubenville today held by the U.S.\nHouse Natural Resources Committee panel on energy and mineral\nresources. Some landowners in Dean Martin\u2019s hometown have\nbenefitted from millions of dollars in bonus checks from\ndrilling companies.
