 "context": "The following article called 'Knight Surges on Takeover Bids From Getco, Virtu' was published on 2012-11-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nKnight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)  capped its\nbiggest rally in nine years after getting takeover offers from\nGetco LLC and Virtu Financial LLC, setting up a bidding war that\nmay end its 17-year history as an independent company.  Getco\u2019s cash and stock offer values Knight at $3.50 a\nshare, an 18 percent premium from the Nov. 27 close, and retains\nits public listing, according to a filing yesterday from the\nChicago-based high-frequency trader. Virtu submitted a bid to\nbuy Knight for about $3 a share, a person with direct knowledge\nof the matter said. Another person familiar said the company\u2019s\noffer was made yesterday. Knight was bailed out by six financial\ncompanies in August after losing more than $450 million in a\ntrading malfunction.  The offers represent divergent  structures  for the surviving\ncompany and will force Knight\u2019s board to choose between\nimmediate cash and a value ascribed in part by the stock\nmarket\u2019s view of Getco. Shares of the  Jersey City , New Jersey-\nbased market maker rose 15 percent to $3.42 yesterday, bringing\nits three-day rally to 37 percent, the most since July 2003.  \u201cIf you\u2019re involved in a share deal, then you\u2019re betting\nthat their market is going to continue to grow and there is an\nupside after the deal, whereas in a cash-only deal the upside is\nyou\u2019re taking cash, and cash now,\u201d said Sang Lee, managing\npartner at Boston-based Aite Group LLC, in a phone interview.\n\u201cIt really depends on how the shareholders look at the market\nthat all these firms are in.\u201d  Market Makers  Virtu, Getco and Knight are automated market makers. While\nGetco and Virtu operate across asset classes mainly on exchanges\nand similar platforms around the world, Knight focuses on U.S.\nequities. It\u2019s also a wholesale market maker that services\nhundreds of retail brokers including  Fidelity Investments  and  TD\nAmeritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD)  by executing buy and sell orders for\nindividuals. Neither Getco nor New York-based Virtu is in that\nbusiness.  Knight slipped 3.8 percent to $3.29 as of 9:42 a.m. in  New\nYork . Volume for the company was 47.3 million shares yesterday,\nmore than 18 times its three-month daily average of 2.58 million\nshares through Nov. 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Knight declined to comment on Getco\u2019s proposal, citing a\npolicy to not discuss shareholder activities, according to a\nstatement from the company. Doug Cifu, president and chief\noperating officer of New York-based Virtu, declined to comment.  Getco Proposal  Under Getco\u2019s proposal, its chief executive officer,  Daniel Coleman , would head the new company and Knight CEO Thomas Joyce\nwould be non-executive chairman. The offer is a 41 percent\npremium to the stock\u2019s closing price on Nov. 23, the filing\nsaid.  Getco is proposing a two-step reverse merger in which\nKnight would be reorganized as a holding company with Getco\nreceiving 242 million newly issued shares and warrants to buy 69\nmillion more. The company would make a tender offer for up to\n154 million Knight shares -- about half those outstanding,\nexcluding Getco\u2019s current stake -- at $3.50, or about $539\nmillion. Getco\u2019s existing stake in Knight, about 57 million\nshares, would be retired.  \u201cThey think there\u2019s long-term value in the company because\nthey\u2019re making a bid and because of how the warrants are\nstructured,\u201d Keith Ross, CEO of PDQ enterprises LLC, a Chicago-\nbased dark pool operator, said in a phone interview. He was head\nof Getco from 2002 to 2005. \u201cThe warrants give them an\nincentive to help the company be profitable. This is an\nadditional carrot.\u201d  More Attractive  Two people said automated market-maker Virtu plans to\nassert in talks with Knight that the offer is more attractive\nthan the bid announced yesterday by Getco because it is for all\nof Knight\u2019s shares and is more likely to be completed, according\nto two people familiar with the matter.  The proposal would be financed by capital contributed by\nSilver Lake Management LLC, which owns a stake in Virtu, other\nprivate equity firms and individuals, and a loan commitment of\nat least $1 billion led by Credit Suisse Group AG, another\nperson said. All three spoke on condition of anonymity because\nthe talks are private.  \u201cAn all-cash offer is going to trump mixed consideration,\nbut we still don\u2019t know where Virtu\u2019s offer is going to be\nexactly above $3, while we know that Getco is at $3.50,\u201d  Sachin Shah , a special situations and merger arbitrage strategist at\nTullett Prebon Americas Corp. in Jersey City, said in a phone\ninterview. \u201cThe board will have to evaluate the merits of each\noffer and it may be looking for more from a white knight or from\nthese two bidders.\u201d  Trading Malfunction  Knight shares were above $10 prior to the trading\nmalfunction and bailout, which diluted existing owners by more\nthan 70 percent. The company dodged bankruptcy almost four\nmonths ago when six financial firms, including Getco, provided\n$400 million to restore the company\u2019s capital after the trading\nmalfunction, when incorrectly installed software caused it to\nbombard U.S. exchanges with unintended orders.  \u201cWhat happened with Knight made them more of a takeover\ntarget than other firms,\u201d  Adam Sussman , partner and director of\nresearch and Tabb Group LLC in New York, said in a phone\ninterview. \u201cIt makes sense for the industry and the company.\nThere\u2019s an oversupply of capacity whether it\u2019s on the market-\nmaking, execution or research side.\u201d  Getco\u2019s offer would result in no  shareholder  owning more\nthan 20 percent of the combined company and most large\nshareholders would be under 10 percent, according to the filing\ntoday. The board of the combined company would include four\ndirectors nominated by former Getco shareholders and three\ndirectors currently on Knight\u2019s board. Getco said it has lined\nup $950 million in financing for the deal.  Ultimate Value  The ultimate value in combining Knight and Getco will\ndepend in part on whether the shares trade at a discount or\npremium to their book value, which Getco estimated at $3.50,\n Christopher Allen , an analyst at  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR)  in New\nYork, said in a phone interview.  \u201cWhat it would trade at post-bid is hard to say because we\ndon\u2019t know what Getco\u2019s financials look like,\u201d Allen said.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to know more about Getco\u2019s profitability, risk\nprofile, volatility of earnings and balance sheet before you\ncould say whether they\u2019d trade at a premium or discount.\u201d  Knight has transformed over the last decade from mainly\nhandling orders from individuals sent by brokers into a\nfinancial services company with institutional clients,\nelectronic trading and businesses in fixed income and currency.\nIt owns the Hotspot FX and BondPoint platforms, provides\nresearch and asset management and got into the reverse mortgage\nbusiness in 2010. Knight had more than 1,545 employees at the\nend of September, it said in a regulatory filing.  \u2018Better World\u2019  In an Aug. 6 interview, Getco\u2019s Coleman said Knight\u2019s\ndisappearance wouldn\u2019t have yielded a \u201cbetter world\u201d for\nGetco. Without Knight\u2019s ability to provide liquidity, \u201cit would\nbe more expensive for everyone to trade,\u201d he said in a phone\ninterview.  \u201cIn some ways Knight\u2019s a competitor, in some ways they\u2019re\na client, in some ways we\u2019re their client,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cBut\nat the end of the day the liquidity they provide and I think the\nliquidity we provide probably makes both of us better. This is\nin our strategic interest to make sure Knight stays viable.\u201d  Along with Getco, founded in 1999, the firms that provided\ncapital to Knight in August included Blackstone Group LP,\nbrokerages Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and Ameritrade and investment\nbanks Stephens Inc. and  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  Virtu does not have\na stake in the company.  Jefferies profit from its stake in Knight may be pushed to\n$160 million based on the valuation Getco is proposing and $120\nmillion for Virtu\u2019s $3 a share bid. The firm acquired\nconvertible preferred securities that were swapped for about 81\nmillion common shares of Knight for $1.50 each.
