 "context": "The following article called 'MF Global Can Use Insurance for Defense Costs, Judge Rules' was published on 2012-04-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJon Corzine  and other former\nexecutives of  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) , facing lawsuits over the\ncompany\u2019s collapse, can use insurance funds to cover their\ndefense costs.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn ruled in court papers\nfiled in  Manhattan  bankruptcy court today that the so-called\nautomatic stay that protects assets in a bankruptcy could be\nlifted to let insurers advance as much as $30 million.  \u201cThe automatic stay should be lifted so that directors,\nofficers and employees may receive advancement or reimbursement\nof reasonable defense costs,\u201d Glenn said.  The judge said his ruling was made without determining\nwhether the proceeds of the insurance policies might belong to\ncustomers of the failed MF Global brokerage or creditors of its\nbankrupt holding company.  He also said MF Global customers are\nqualified to object to the payment of defense costs.  The brokerage\u2019s commodity customers objected to the\nproposal at a hearing this month, saying money that could cover\nfunds missing from their accounts shouldn\u2019t be used \u201cto finance\nthe defense of the culprits of the MF Global disaster.\u201d  \u2018One Dollar Less\u2019  \u201cEvery dollar that\u2019s paid out of the policy is one dollar\nless to satisfy clams against each of the debtors if the\ncommodity customers have tort claims against the parent\ncompany,\u201d Glenn said at the April 2 hearing.  He said at the time that he would consider a cap on the\noutflow of money until further agreements could be reached by\ntrustees for customer and creditor assets. Glenn said today that\na cap of $30 million for defense costs is appropriate.  The insurance proceeds at issue total $375 million, Lorenzo Marinuzzi, a lawyer representing the trustee for MF Global\nHoldings,  Louis Freeh , told Glenn on April 2. About 21 lawsuits\nfiled against MF Global executives are expected to be\nconsolidated.  A representative from one insurance company told the court\nthat 33 individuals have so far sought reimbursement for\n$8.3 million from the company\u2019s directors\u2019-and-officers\u2019 and\nprofessional-liability insurance.  MF Global Holdings, once run by Corzine, filed the eighth-\nlargest U.S. bankruptcy on Oct. 31 after a $6.3 billion bet on\nbonds of indebted European countries prompted regulatory\nconcerns, a credit downgrade and margin calls.  Customer Money  Corzine, a former New Jersey governor and once a co-\nchairman of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., may face liability if\ninvestigations show that he knew customer money might be used\nwhen transfers were ordered to cover an overdraft with the\ncompany\u2019s biggest lender, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Corzine testified before Congress that he asked for\noverdrafts with JPMorgan to be corrected, and that he never gave\nany instruction to misuse customer funds. He also said he didn\u2019t\nbelieve anything he said could reasonably have been interpreted\nas an instruction to misuse customer funds.  James Giddens, the trustee unwinding MF Global\u2019s brokerage\nunit, estimates a shortfall of $1.6 billion in what former\ncustomers are owed. He has said proceeds from the insurance\npolicies may make up for some of that. At the same time, Giddens\nsaid he doesn\u2019t oppose the payment of some necessary defense\ncosts and suggested they should be monitored.  The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.\nv. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern\nDistrict of  New York  (Manhattan).
