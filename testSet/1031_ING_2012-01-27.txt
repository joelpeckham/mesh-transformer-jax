 "context": "The following article called 'QE3 May Be Preferred Over Fed\u2019s QE2 for Asia Economies Facing Export Slump' was published on 2012-01-27. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. monetary stimulus, blamed in\n2010 for spurring speculative capital flows to  emerging markets ,\nmay find less opposition this time round in Asia as the region\u2019s\nfocus shifts to supporting economic growth.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  laid the groundwork for a\nthird round of quantitative easing through asset purchases, a\nso-called QE3, saying two days ago the Fed is prepared for\nfurther \u201caccommodation.\u201d Officials from China to South Korea\nwere among those who criticized QE2, when they were raising\n interest rates  in part to stem property and stock price surges.  This time, exports are slowing and Asian currencies have\nfallen, with the  International Monetary Fund  predicting growth\nin developing Asia at 7.3 percent this year, compared with 9.5\npercent in 2010. The difference means there may be less need for\nmeasures to limit capital inflows, after nations from Thailand\nto Indonesia took such steps last time.  \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a situation where Asian economies were\ndoing well and we were dealing with too much money to one where\ngrowth is slowing and inflows are becoming more balanced,\u201d said\nSanjay Mathur, Singapore-based head of research and strategy for\nnon-Japan  Asia  at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. \u201cThe voices\nagainst quantitative easing from Asia won\u2019t be so loud and it\nwon\u2019t draw as much resistance this time around.\u201d  Currency Slump  Europe \u2019s debt crisis, and the concern that  Greece  will\nenter a disorderly default, tempered investors\u2019 appetite for\nemerging-market assets in 2011. During the week of Sept. 19,\nAsian currencies tumbled the most since the region\u2019s financial\ncrisis in 1998, prompting nations to deploy some of their\ncurrency reserves in defense.  The  Indian rupee  has declined about 11 percent in the past\nsix months, followed by a 6.5 percent drop in the South Korean\nwon and a 5.5 percent depreciation in the Indonesian rupiah. The\nMSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks slumped about 17 percent last\nyear, halting a two-year rally in equities.  A slowdown in Asia may be spreading with economists\npredicting  Taiwan  will report weaker  growth  when it releases\ngross domestic product figures on Jan. 31. Taiwan\u2019s GDP\nincreased 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace in\nmore than two years, according to the median estimate in a\nBloomberg News survey.  Korea Slowdown  South Korea \u2019s economy grew the least in two years last\nquarter as exports sank 1.5 percent from the previous three-\nmonth period, the central bank said yesterday.  The  Philippines  may say its economy expanded 3.8 percent in\nthe fourth quarter from a year earlier after growing 3.2 percent\nin the previous three months, another survey showed ahead of\nfigures due Jan. 30. The Philippine economy probably grew 3.7\npercent in 2011, less than half the 7.3 percent pace reported in\n2010, according to a separate survey.  \u201cIf there is a QE3 in the near term, we think it would be\nless problematic for Asian policy makers this time around,\u201d\nsaid Paul Gruenwald, chief Asia economist at Australia & New\nZealand Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore . \u201cInflation pressures\nare falling and the policy bias is clearly to cut rates. So a\nbit of additional stimulus from the Fed would be helpful.\u201d  Malaysia \u2019s central bank may give clues about its readiness\nto lower  borrowing costs  next week, when it\u2019s likely to keep its\nbenchmark rate unchanged for a fourth straight meeting,\naccording to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Balancing Risks  \u201cThe current rates continue to be accommodative,\u201d Bank\nNegara Malaysia Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz told reporters today.\n\u201cWe will make an assessment of the degree of accommodation that\nis important for our economy to sustain growth and employment.\nWe have to balance the risk to growth with the risk to\ninflation.\u201d  The Fed bought $1.7 trillion worth of Treasury and mortgage\ndebt between December 2008 and March 2010. As the Fed announced\nits next round of purchases in November 2010,  China \u2019s Vice\nForeign Minister Cui Tiankai said the U.S. \u201cowes us some\nexplanation on their decision.\u201d Chinese central bank adviser\nXia Bin called it \u201cuncontrolled\u201d money printing and then-\nJapanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  cited the U.S. pursuing a\n\u201cweak-dollar policy.\u201d  Asia\u2019s foreign reserves grew \u201csignificantly faster than\nany time in history\u201d between April 2009 and September 2010 as\nthe region attracted about $2 billion of capital inflows daily,\naccording to DBS Group Holdings. About $600 billion in foreign\ncapital flowed into Asia in the year through June 2010,\nSingapore\u2019s central bank said.  Monitoring Flows  Any signs of resurgent capital inflows may still spark\ncriticism from Asian officials, said  Tim Condon , chief Asia\neconomist at ING Financial Markets.  \u201cIf there were to be QE, and by that I mean a significant\neasing of U.S. monetary policy, there would be a significant\ndepreciation of the  U.S. dollar  and Asian currencies would be on\nthe other side of that trade,\u201d Singapore-based Condon said.\n\u201cCentral banks may initially be less hostile but they will be\nreceiving the flows and in some cases they would react the same\nway\u201d as they did during QE2, he said.  The South Korean won and Malaysian ringgit may be among the\nbiggest beneficiaries of another round of Fed quantitative\neasing, Mathur of RBS said. He also recommends the dollar debt\nof the Philippines and  Indonesia .  Shift in Tone  So far, the tone from policy makers has been different.  \u201cThe Fed move affirms some policy certainty from that part\nof the world, which is important for anchoring global investor\naction and which could translate to providing emerging market\neconomies, including the Philippines some policy breather to\nconcentrate on improving domestic demand,\u201d Philippine Governor\nAmando Tetangco said yesterday. \u201cTo the extent that the Fed\naction sustains the positive growth outlook in the U.S., this\nshould also be positive for our own trade prospects.\u201d  By contrast, Philippine officials had said that QE2 would\nadd to global liquidity and that they were prepared to address\ncapital inflows through a \u201cmenu\u201d of measures.  Bank of  Thailand  Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said\nyesterday the Fed\u2019s decision to keep low rates until 2014 is\n\u201cnecessary to facilitate the economic recovery.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nShamim Adam in Singapore at \n sadam2@bloomberg.net ;\nKarl Lester M.
