 "context": "The following article called 'UBS, Credit Suisse May Need to Boost Capital to 19%' was published on 2010-10-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUBS AG  and  Credit Suisse Group AG \nneed to hold almost double the capital required under Basel III\nrules, said a Swiss government-appointed  panel , proposing the\nfirst capital surcharge on too-big-to-fail banks.  Switzerland\u2019s biggest banks should hold total capital equal\nto at least 19 percent of their assets, weighted according to\nrisk, compared with 10.5 percent level the Basel Committee on\nBanking Supervision announced last month, the Swiss panel said\ntoday. By 2019, the lenders need to have a common equity ratio\nof at least 10 percent, compared with 7 percent required under\nBasel III rules, and the rest in contingent capital.  Switzerland, which propped up UBS in the credit crisis,\nasked the panel of bankers, regulators and other experts to\npropose ways of avoiding future bailouts. The two banks\u2019 total\nassets of 2.6 trillion Swiss francs ($2.64 trillion) are more\nthan four times the size of the Swiss economy.  The plan is \u201ca win-win situation for Switzerland,\u201d said\n Harris Dellas , a professor of macroeconomics and monetary policy\nat the University of Bern. \u201cIf the banks don\u2019t manage to raise\nthe required extra capital, they will have to shrink without the\ngovernment directly forcing them to. If they do, then this means\nthat the markets have faith in them and they can continue\nplaying in the big league.\u201d  No Share Sales  The proposals, which have to be endorsed by the government\nand approved by Parliament, may jump-start the market for\ncontingent convertible bonds, or CoCos. The banks, which said\nlast week their risk-weighted assets may balloon to 400 billion\nfrancs each under the Basel III rules, may have to sell as much\nas 72 billion francs in CoCos to meet the new requirements,\naccording to Bloomberg calculations. The banks said they plan to\ntake steps to \u201csignificantly\u201d reduce risk-weighted assets.  UBS and Credit Suisse both expect to meet the new capital\nrequirements without having to sell new shares, the banks said\ntoday in separate statements.  \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a challenge to the Swiss banks to have a\nmassive overcapitalization relative to peers, but it is\nachievable,\u201d  Dirk Hoffmann-Becking , a London-based analyst at\nSanford C. Bernstein, said. He said the minimum common equity\nrequirement is lower than the 12 percent he expected.  UBS  fell 0.5 percent to 16.58 francs in Zurich trading,\nparing this year\u2019s gain to 3.3 percent. Smaller rival  Credit\nSuisse  climbed 0.4 percent to 41.94 francs.  Limited Dividends  UBS is \u201cconfident\u201d of being able to meet the new\nrequirements without raising common equity or disposing of any\n\u201cmaterial\u201d part of the business, Chief Financial Officer  John Cryan  said on a conference call. While UBS still sees the right\nlevel of capital for its business at about 50 billion francs,\nmeaning a common equity ratio of about 13 percent, the bank may\nresume dividend payments before it hits that mark, he said.  Credit Suisse said it can comply with the measures\n\u201cwithout having to materially change its growth plans or\ncurrent capital and dividend policies.\u201d  Dividend payments in the coming years will depend on\nwhether the banks are successful in selling contingent\nconvertibles, Hoffmann-Becking said. Even if they can\u2019t sell any\nCoCos and have to meet the 19 percent target with only common\nequity, UBS could achieve that in 2014 and Credit Suisse in 2015\nto 2017 by cutting risk-weighted assets and halting dividends.  \u201cThere is a big interest in having a functioning CoCo\nmarket,\u201d Thomas Jordan, vice chairman of the Swiss central bank\nand a member of the panel, said at a press conference in Bern.\nThe cost of CoCos may be between those of equity and of\ncorporate bonds, with the added advantage of interest payments\nbeing tax deductible, he said. \u201cCoCos would provide capital\nexactly at the time when it\u2019s needed,\u201d he said.  Breakup Rejected  The panel, which rejected proposals to break up the two\nZurich-based banks or directly limit their size and activities,\nsuch as proprietary trading, recommended a \u201crapid\u201d\nimplementation of all the proposals as a package.  Peter Siegenthaler , who heads the commission, said he would expect the\ngovernment to send the proposal to Parliament next year.  Three of the four biggest parties in Switzerland\u2019s\nparliament signaled they may approve the commission\u2019s proposals.  \u201cThis is a good proposal with the right priorities,\u201d said\n Hans Kaufmann , the economic affairs spokesman for the Swiss\nPeople\u2019s Party. We are \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with the report, said\n Fulvio Pelli , president of the Swiss Liberals. The CoCo bonds\nare a \u201cgood idea,\u201d said  Pirmin Bischof , a member of the lower\nhouse for the Christian Democrats.  The minimum equity proposals were watered down by\nrepresentatives of the big banks while measures to curb risk-\ntaking are insufficient, the Social Democrats said.  Capital Buffer  The Basel committee on Sept. 12 set the new minimum ratio\nof common equity to risk-weighted assets for banks from 27\ncountries at 4.5 percent, plus a buffer of 2.5 percent. The\nrequirement, which has to be met by 2019, compares with the 2\npercent minimum ratio under less-strict Basel II rules.  Under today\u2019s proposals, the two banks may need to increase\nthe capital buffer to 8.5 percent. Of that, at least 5.5 percent\nhas to be in the form of common equity, compared with Basel\u2019s\n2.5 percent, and the rest can be made up of contingent capital,\nsuch as CoCos.  The plan is also the first globally to apply a specific\ncapital surcharge for systemically important banks. The size of\nthis additional capital buffer, currently proposed at 6 percent,\ncan change over time, depending on the ratio of a bank\u2019s assets\nto the Swiss economy, its market share of domestic lending and\nhow easy it would be to liquidate. All of this cushion should be\nin the form of contingent capital, the panel said.  Stricter Rules  The first contingent capital buffer should convert into\nequity once common equity falls below 7 percent of risk-weighted\nassets. The second cushion could convert at a 5 percent common\nequity ratio and may be used to support the systemically\nimportant parts of a bank\u2019s business, while the rest is wound\ndown in a crisis, the panel proposed. The experts also suggested\nmaking stricter liquidity rules for the two banks, which came\ninto force at the end of June, into law.  UBS\u2019s Cryan said he doubts the bank would let common equity\nfall as low as 5 percent, triggering the conversion of CoCo\nbonds, which would make the second buffer a \u201cvery expensive\ninsurance policy.\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t sure which investors would\nbuy the instruments, as equity holders would prefer stocks and\ntraditional fixed-income buyers would demand a \u201csignificant\npremium\u201d for the additional risk.  Switzerland rescued UBS in 2008, investing 6 billion francs\nto help the bank spin off $39 billion of toxic assets into a\nSwiss central bank fund. The state sold its  UBS  holdings for a\nprofit of 1.2 billion francs less than a year later. Credit\nSuisse declined government assistance.  Dodd-Frank Act  Switzerland is not alone in addressing the issues of too-\nbig-to-fail banks. The Financial Stability Board, which\ncoordinates the work of national financial regulators on an\ninternational level, is due to make recommendations on the topic\nto the Group of 20 leaders\u2019 summit in November.  The U.S. passed a set of financial rules in July, giving\nregulators new authority to unwind failing financial firms that\nmay threaten the entire system, as well as imposing limits on\nproprietary trading at banks. The bill, known as the Dodd-Frank\nAct, also prevents the Federal Reserve from approving bank\nacquisitions that would result in a firm exceeding 10 percent of\nthe total liabilities of the U.S. banking system and requires\nregulators to make recommendations on standards for risk-based\ncapital, leverage, liquidity and contingent capital.  At the height of the credit crunch in 2008, Swiss\nregulators gave UBS and Credit Suisse four years to raise their\nrisk-weighted capital to as much as double the Basel II\nrequirements. A cap on leverage means the banks must aim to hold\ncapital equal to at least 5 percent of their assets in good\ntimes.
