 "context": "The following article called 'THL\u2019s Sperling Says New U.S. Regulations Weighing on Wall Street' was published on 2012-03-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nScott Sperling, co-president of\nprivate-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, said new\nfinancial regulations are hurting the  U.S. economy  and\nincreasing costs at  Wall Street  banks and asset managers.  Sperling, who leads the Boston-based firm with Anthony DiNovi, said that while the regulations do well by reducing\nleverage in the financial system, there are some unintended\nconsequences. By restricting banks from proprietary trading, the\nproposed Volcker rule would limit lenders\u2019 ability to provide\nliquidity to financial markets, he said.  \u201cThere are significant challenges from the Volcker rule\nand Dodd-Frank that actually cause them to do things that\nincrease the risk of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Sperling said today\nin an interview with Bloomberg Television\u2019s Cristina Alesci.\n\u201cTherefore they have to pull back from some of the activities\nthat can be very helpful to the markets.\u201d  A longtime Democrat, Sperling, 54, said he supports\nRepublican  Mitt Romney  against  Barack Obama  in the U.S.\npresidential contest. Romney, a co-founder and former chief\nexecutive officer of Boston-based Bain Capital LLC, has\nattracted negative attention for the private-equity industry\nfrom opponents who say buyout managers enrich themselves at the\ncost of companies and workers and benefit from preferential tax\ntreatment.  Obama and other Democrats have backed proposals to raise\ntaxes on investment performance fees, known as carried interest,\nthat private-equity managers receive. During the campaign,\nRomney has yet to say definitively whether he favors treating\nthe earnings as  capital gains , as they are now, or as higher-\ntaxed income.  Washington\u2019s \u2018Punching Bag\u2019  \u201cThe political environment is not going to get better\nthrough November, it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d Sperling said.\n\u201cYet I think Mitt has an incredible skill set for the\nchallenges that we have in front of us.\u201d  The March 14 New York Times op-ed piece by  Greg Smith , the\nformer  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  derivatives salesman, is another\n\u201cflashpoint of criticism\u201d that may affect morale at Wall\nStreet banks, Sperling said. In the piece, Smith blamed CEO\n Lloyd Blankfein  and President  Gary Cohn  for fostering a \u201ctoxic\nand destructive\u201d environment.  \u201cIn an environment where they\u2019re getting punished in the\npress almost daily and have become the punching bag for many\nfolks in  Washington , it makes it a less enjoyable environment to\nbe in,\u201d Sperling said.  Goldman Sachs lost $2.15 billion of its market value the\nday  the op-ed  was published.  Paul Volcker , the formal Federal\nReserve chairman who originally proposed the Volcker rule,\ncalled Smith\u2019s article \u201ca radical, strong\u201d piece.  U.S. Retail Growth  THL has made investments valued at more than $150 billion\nin aggregate since its founding in 1974. The firm, which manages\n$14 billion in assets, has stakes in companies including  Dunkin\u2019\nBrands Inc. (DNKN) , Clear Channel Communications Inc. and  Nielsen\nHoldings NV (NLSN) .  As private-equity managers are hitting the road this year\nto raise new capital, Sperling said he expects fund sizes to\nshrink. Fundraising slowed in the third quarter last year to the\nweakest pace since before the global financial crisis and stayed\nnear that level in the final three months of the year, according\nto London-based researcher  Preqin Ltd .  \u201cI think that we have to be prepared for smaller fund\nsizes,\u201d Sperling said. \u201cThe fund size should be smaller\nbecause the nature of the deals that are being done will be\nsmaller.\u201d  Sperling said he expects more deals in the U.S. retail\nindustry, attracting private-equity investors. As the economy\nimproves, so will consumer markets including retail and health\ncare, he said.  \u201cMacroeconomic uncertainty is becoming less of an issue,\u201d\nSperling said. \u201cPeople are getting comfortable that the\nconsumer is going to be there, and going to be growing in the\nU.S. market.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nDevin Banerjee in New York at \n dbanerjee2@bloomberg.net ;\nCristina Alesci in New York at \n calesci2@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChristian Baumgaertel at \n cbaumgaertel@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Nielsen Holdings N.V. was 23.59438705444336 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Nielsen Holdings N.V. was ",
