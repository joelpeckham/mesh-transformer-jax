(SGEN)  Chief\nExecutive Officer  Clay Siegall  says he has a model for growth of\nthe biotechnology company\u2019s only drug, cancer treatment\nAdcetris:  Roche Holding AG (ROG) \u2019s $6.7 billion-seller Rituxan.  Adcetris received U.S. clearance in August for use by\nHodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patients who failed on other therapies, a\nsmaller market than the front-line treatment the company aims\nfor after added trials are completed in the next few years.\nRituxan, approved as an initial treatment for lymphoma in 1997,\ntook a similar path, Siegall said in a telephone interview.  Analysts expect Adcetris to reach $437 million in  sales  in\n2015, the average of three estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The\ndrug\u2019s prospects have boosted the company\u2019s shares 50 percent\nthis year, giving the company a market value of more than\n$2.9 billion. That potential also makes Seattle Genetics less\nlikely to seek a merger or be acquired now, Siegall said.  \u201cAdcetris is a very important brand, and can become a $1\nbillion brand in a number of years,\u201d Siegall said. The\ndrugmaker has \u201cgreat trajectory going forward, so it\u2019s not a\ntime where we feel that it\u2019s right for the company to get sold\nor flipped.\u201d  Seattle Genetics fell 1.4 percent to $24.99 at the close in\n New York .  Adcetris combines a cancer-targeting antibody with the\ncell-killing effects of chemotherapy. The drug, known chemically\nas brentuximab, is Seattle Genetics\u2019 first product, and was also\ncleared by regulators to treat patients with a rarer cancer\nknown as systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma or ALCL, who\nhad also failed previous treatments.  Killer Disease  Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma  will be diagnosed in an estimated 9,060\nU.S. patients this year and will cause the death of about 1,190\npeople, according to the  National Cancer Institute  in Bethesda,\n Maryland . The disease begins in the white-blood cells and most\ncommonly strikes people from ages 15 to 35 and older than 55.  Roche\u2019s Genentech unit \u201calso initially got approved in one\ntype of low-grade lymphoma, and then got approved in a variety\nof different aggressive and high grade lymphomas, and even some\nother non-lymphomas,\u201d Siegall said.  Half of the 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey recommend\npurchasing Seattle Genetics shares, with three rating them a\nsell.  \u201cDespite the limited number of patients, we believe that\nthe drug also has substantial opportunity,\u201d beyond its current\nregulatory clearance, Mani Mohindru, an analyst with Think\nEquity LLC in New York, wrote in a note to clients on July 5.  Roche is based in  Basel , Switzerland.
