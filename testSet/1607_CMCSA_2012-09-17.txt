 "context": "The following article called 'NHL Owners Impose Lockout as Malkin, Gonchar Head to Russia' was published on 2012-09-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  National Hockey League  has\nlocked out its players for the second time in seven seasons and\nAll-Stars Evgeni Malkin and Sergei Gonchar already signed\ncontracts to play in  Russia  during the work stoppage.  The players were locked out after the league and the NHL\nPlayers\u2019 Association were unable to come to an agreement on a\nnew labor deal before the midnight Sept. 15 deadline. NHL\nCommissioner Gary Bettman and NHLPA executive director Don Fehr\nhad exchanged contract proposals during meetings in New York\nover the previous four days.  It\u2019s the NHL\u2019s third lockout in 18 years. The 1994-95\ncampaign was shortened to 48 games, while the 2004-05 season was\ncanceled and the  Stanley Cup  not awarded for the first time\nsince 1919. The 2012-13 season is scheduled to begin Oct. 11.  \u201cThis is a time of year for all attention to be focused on\nthe ice, not on a meeting room,\u201d the NHL  said in a letter  to\nfans yesterday. \u201cThe league, the clubs and the players all have\na stake in resolving our bargaining issues appropriately and\ngetting the puck dropped as soon as possible. We owe it to each\nother, to the game and, most of all, to the fans.\u201d  Malkin, who won last season\u2019s Hart Trophy as the NHL\u2019s Most\nValuable Player with the  Pittsburgh Penguins , signed a deal to\nplay with Russia\u2019s Metallurg Magnitogorsk, according to the\nKontinental Hockey League club\u2019s website. Malkin, 26, had 50\ngoals and 59 assists last season.  Gonchar, a 38-year-old defenseman with the  Ottawa Senators ,\nalso signed with Mettalurg. Both players can terminate the KHL\ndeals and return to the NHL if the lockout ends. The KHL has\nlimited its 26 teams to signing a maximum of three players each\nfrom locked-out NHL teams.  Compensation, Revenue  NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in a Sept. 15\nstatement that neither the league nor the players was willing to\nmove off of its last proposal. The sides are arguing over player\ncompensation and revenue sharing.  \u201cI\u2019m sure we will keep in touch in the coming days and\nschedule meetings to the extent they might be useful or\nappropriate,\u201d Daly said. \u201cWe are sorry for where we are.\u00a0Not\nwhat we hoped or expected.\u201d  The players\u2019 union was prepared to meet two days ago prior\nto the deadline, said Steve Fehr, special counsel to the NHLPA.  \u201cThe NHL said that it saw no purpose in having a formal\nmeeting,\u201d he said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThere have been\nand continue to be private, informal discussions between\nrepresentatives of both sides.\u201d  Owners\u2019 Offer  On Sept. 12, owners offered players 47 percent of hockey-\nrelated revenue, with a loss of about $256 million in player\nsalaries next year. The offer was one percentage point more than\nin their previous proposal, Don Fehr said. Under the latest\ndeal, players received 57 percent.  The union\u2019s Sept. 12 offer, according to Don Fehr, tied the\nplayers\u2019 share to revenue growth, with the proportion decreasing\nas hockey-related revenue increased. Under the plan, should\nleague revenue grow at the same rate as the past 10 years, the\nplayers\u2019 share would decrease to 54.3 percent in the first year,\nthen 52.5 percent, 52.0 percent and rise to 52.3 percent in the\nfourth year, he said.  Other contentious issues include salary arbitration and the\nlength of unrestricted free agency.  The league\u2019s total revenue, buoyed by a 10-year, $2 billion\ntelevision contract with  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) \u2019s NBC, swelled to an\nestimated record $3.2 billion last season from $2.2 billion in\n2006, according to the NHL. The league hasn\u2019t said how much of\nthis year\u2019s revenue is profit.  Before the start of the 2011-12 season, the average NHL\nplayer salary was $2.4 million, up from about $1.5 million when\nthe agreement began at the start of the 2005-06 season.  In comparison, the average National Basketball Association\nplayer salary was $5.15 million, the highest among the U.S.\u2019s\nfour major sports leagues, for 2011-12. The average salary for a\nNational Football League player was $1.9 million, the lowest of\nthe four leagues, with  Major League Baseball \u2019s $3.3 million\naverage salary ranking second behind the NBA.  The current collective bargaining agreement was reached\nafter the 2004-05 season was wiped out.
