Europe\u2019s pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent as the euro held firm.\nAs the Fed policy meeting threw up no surprises with rates left unchanged, the focus shifted back to simmering trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as the ongoing first quarter earnings season.\nIn Europe, earnings disappointments from medical technology company Smith & Nephew and postal services provider Bpost soured the mood as the stocks fell 5.9 percent and 10.9 percent respectively, while German drug and crop chemicals maker Bayer flagged a stronger euro in its update.\nE-Mini futures for the S&P 500 crept 0.3 percent higher, with overnight results from Kraft Heinz, Tesla and Spotify in focus.\nSo far it has been a strong earnings season, with the year-on-year blended earnings growth estimate coming in at more than 25 percent in the first quarter for S&P 500 companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, while the equivalent figure for the MSCI EMU index (European Economic and Monetary Union) is 14.6 percent in dollar terms.\nThe negative mood carried over from the Asian trading session, where shares slipped as hopes waned for real progress in Sino-U.S. trade talks, following reports the Trump administration is considering executive action to restrict some Chinese companies\u2019 ability to sell telecoms equipment in the United States.\n\u201cThe risk at the moment is that the increasing uncertainty could create ambiguity in executives\u2019 heads, it makes corporate decision-making more difficult and then (leads to) a decline in investment,\u201d Alastair George, chief investment strategist at Edison Investment Research, said.\nEdison\u2019s George added that the impact from trade tensions was hypothetical at the moment, though.\nTalks between U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are due to kick off later on Thursday.\nHowever, a breakthrough was viewed as highly unlikely, especially as the U.S. embassy said the delegation would leave as early as Friday evening.\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, while South Korean stocks stumbled 0.7 percent.\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index ended 1.3 percent lower, but Chinese shares bucked the trend. The blue chip CSI 300 was up 0.8 percent, but not far from an eight-month low hit in April.\nNO SURPRISES FROM THE FED The Fed policy meeting ended with no change, as expected, while the central bank expressed confidence a recent rise in inflation to near target would be sustained, leaving it on track to raise borrowing costs in June.\n\u201cThe statement carried only modest changes in wording, but they were meaningful nonetheless, highlighting that the Fed is optimistic on the outlook and intent on continuing to raise rates at a gradual pace,\u201d said Westpac analyst Elliot Clarke.\nYet the Fed also emphasised the inflation target was \u201csymmetric\u201d, suggesting it was not inclined to speed up its tightening plans.\n\u201cThe Fed sees little reason to be concerned with inflation marginally above its 2.0 percent target, particularly after such a long period of underperformance,\u201d Clarke said.\nWestpac, like the market, expects two more hikes this year.\nThe Fed statement was not quite as hawkish as some had wagered on and caused a dip in the dollar, though sentiment remained bullish given U.S. rates were still clearly heading higher while those in Europe and Japan lagged far behind.\nThe euro was last at $1.1972 having hit a 15-week trough at $1.1936 on Wednesday, uncomfortably close to the low for the year at $1.1915. The euro trimmed gains after Euro zone inflation unexpectedly slipped in April.\nThe dollar also scored a three-month peak on the yen at 110.05 overnight, before edging back to 109.63.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar index was trading at 92.569, after reaching the highest since late December at 92.834.\nIn the Treasury market, yields dipped slightly as a quarterly refunding programme of $73 billion came in short of expectations, reducing the pressure on prices from the torrent of supply.\nOil prices inched higher with Brent crude futures up at $73.46 a barrel, while U.S. crude was at $68.08.\nSpot gold was up 0.4 percent at $1,310.48 an ounce.
