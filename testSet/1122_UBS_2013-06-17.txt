The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTemasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore \u2019s\nstate-owned investment company, said it has set up a U.K.-based\nunit that will focus on investments in the region.  John Cryan, president of Europe and co-head of the\nportfolio and strategy group, was named as one of the two\ndirectors of the new unit, Financial News reported earlier\ntoday.  Stephen Forshaw , a spokesman for the investment company,\nconfirmed in an e-mailed statement that the creation of the\n\u201cU.K-incorporated entity\u201d will help Cryan\u2019s role.  The share of Temasek\u2019s investments in Europe and North\nAmerica increased to 11 percent of its portfolio as of March\n2012 from 8 percent in the previous year, according to its\nlatest annual review, published in July. Temasek paid 1 billion\neuros ($1.3 billion) for a 5.04 percent stake in  Repsol SA (REP) , the\nSpanish oil company said in March. It agreed to buy a 4.6\npercent stake in German chemical maker  Evonik Industries AG (EVK) , a\nperson familiar with the matter said in March.  The new unit \u201cprovides a suitable setup to match our\ninvestment activity in Europe, which will very much be a\ncontinuing focus for us,\u201d Forshaw said in the statement. \u201cThe\nunit\u2019s creation does not signal a shift in Temasek\u2019s approach to\ntransactions in the market. We have similar entities in other\ncountries.\u201d  Temasek \u201chasn\u2019t made a commitment on that at this time,\u201d\nForshaw said in regards to whether the entity paves the way for\nthe investment company to open an office in Europe.  The investment firm last year hired Cryan, the former chief\nfinancial officer of UBS AG, as its president for Europe.  The investment company has offices or affiliates in Mexico\nCity, Sao Paulo, Mumbai, Beijing,  Shanghai , Hong Kong, Chennai\nin  India , as well as Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, both in\n Vietnam , according to its website.  Government of Singapore Investment Corp ., the city-state\u2019s\nother investment company, is planning to open a Sao Paulo office\nnext year, a person familiar with the matter said last week.
