The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBlackstone Group LP (BX)  is seeking to\nsell a west  London  office park for 67 percent more than it paid\nfor the property 18 months ago, two people with knowledge of the\nmatter said.  Blackstone, manager of the world\u2019s largest real estate\nfund, is offering Chiswick Park for about 800 million pounds\n($1.3 billion) and hired  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  to sell the property,\nthe people said. They asked not to be identified because the\ninformation is private. Ken Caplan, Blackstone\u2019s head of\nEuropean real estate, declined to comment.  Blackstone bought Chiswick Park Unit Trust, the fund that\nowns the property, in April 2011 for 480 million pounds. Since\nthen, Blackstone cut vacancies at the 33-acre (13-hectare) park\nto 1 percent from 9 percent. In November, the company started\nwork on a 215,000 square-foot (20,000 square-meter) building on\nthe site that  Aker Solutions  will lease. Other Chiswick Park\ntenants include Walt Disney Co., Tullow Oil Plc and Halliburton\nCo.  The completion of the building next year will increase the\namount of space at the park to 1.33 million square feet,\nexcluding consent for an additional 333,000 square-foot office\nbuilding, the park\u2019s last site available for development.  Rising Rents  Annual rents at Chiswick Park are, on average, about 45\npounds a square foot, 10 pounds more than when Blackstone\nacquired the property, the people said. That reflects a shortage\nof large modern or recently refurbished office space in London.  Senior loans of 302.3 million pounds funding the purchase\nof Chiswick Park were sold as commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities in June 2011 in what was  Europe \u2019s first CMBS sale\nsince 2007.  \u201cPrepayment on the sale of the asset should not be taken\nas a given,\u201d Deutsche Bank AG asset-backed bond analysts said\nin a note to investors today.  The purchase was also funded by a 61 million-pound\nmezzanine loan, the analysts said. Cash-rich investors, like a\nsovereign debt fund, may be deterred by the high leverage, so\n\u201cwe would therefore expect any sale to encompass the prepayment\nof the loan (plus swap)\u201d and additional fees, they said.  Property Week reported the planned sale yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSimon Packard in London at \n packard@bloomberg.net .
