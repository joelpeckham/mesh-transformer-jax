Energetica de Minas Gerais  fell\nto its lowest in a year as Folha de S.Paulo reported  Brazil \u2019s\ngovernment is concerned that the low level of water reservoirs\nmay lead to energy rationing.  Preferred shares  of Brazil\u2019s second-biggest electric\nutility by market value, known as Cemig, slumped 2.8 percent to\n21.31 reais at 1:54 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the lowest on a closing\nbasis since October 2011. The MSCI Brazil Utilities Index\ndropped 1.7 percent.  \u201cIf an energy rationing really happens, utilities would\ngenerate less power and consequently have smaller revenue,\u201d\nHenrique Kleine, an analyst at Magliano SA in Sao Paulo, said by\ntelephone. \u201cThis would be an extra problem for these companies,\nwho are already facing declining income because of recent\nmeasures taken by the government to cut rates.\u201d  President  Dilma Rousseff  asked power utilities to attend an\nemergency meeting on Jan. 9 to discuss the risk that the\ncountry\u2019s reservoirs might fall so low that energy rationing is\nneeded, the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported today, citing\nunnamed government officials.  A presidential press officer who asked not to be identified\nin accord with internal policy said by phone from Brasilia that\nRousseff is on vacation and there is no such meeting on her\nschedule.  The Ministry of Mines and Energy said in a  statement  today\non its website that Minister Edison Lobao will hold a monthly\nmeeting with government officials and regulators on Jan. 9.\nUtility representatives may also attend, according to the\nstatement, which didn\u2019t mention Rousseff.  Reservoirs in northeastern Brazil were 32 percent full, on\naverage, last month, less than the 34 percent minimum the\ngovernment considers safe for the region\u2019s dams, according to\ndata on the national power grid operator\u2019s website.  Rousseff announced on Sept. 11 a plan to reduce power costs\nby as much as 28 percent to aid households and manufacturers to\nboost economic growth. Changes in contracts will be negotiated\nwith utilities as concessions on government-owned hydroelectric\nplants are renewed between 2015 and 2017, she said.  Cemig said on Dec. 4 it wouldn\u2019t renew contracts to operate\n18 hydro plants because the terms were unfavorable.  The company\u2019s shares lost 38 percent from Rousseff\u2019s\nannouncement in September through Jan. 4. The Bovespa gained 7.1\npercent during the same period.
