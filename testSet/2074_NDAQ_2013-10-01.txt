 "context": "The following article called 'SEC Once Slowed by Data Gap to Report High-Speed Trader Research' was published on 2013-10-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission will soon issue research from its new system for\nmonitoring markets, including a look at practices that some\nblame for giving high-speed traders an unfair edge.  The reports will use data from the SEC\u2019s Midas market-surveillance system, according to two people briefed on the\nplans. The findings could help inform whether new regulations\nare needed to address strategies such as canceling a high\npercentage of orders, said the people, who asked not to be\nidentified because the plan isn\u2019t ready to be announced.  The SEC lacked such a tool during the May 2010 plunge \nknown as the flash crash, when the agency was criticized for \ntaking four months to report the cause of turbulence that \nerased about $862 billion in U.S. equity value in minutes \nbefore share prices recovered.  \u201cThis shows to the outside world that the SEC has been\nquite active in terms of thinking about these issues in\nsophisticated ways,\u201d said Henry Hu, a professor at the\n University of Texas  who led the SEC\u2019s research division from\n2009 to 2011. \u201cToo often, people outside the SEC are not really\naware of just how much effort goes on.\u201d  The SEC acquired its Midas system last year from high-frequency trading firm and technology vendor Tradeworx Inc.\nMidas, an acronym for Market Information Data Analytics System,\ncollects about 1 billion trading records per day from 13 U.S.\nequity exchanges, which sell similar data to high-speed firms\nand brokers that want information milliseconds before the\npublic.  More Data  Midas provides the regulator with more complete data than\ntraders and researchers can see from the public feeds operated\nby  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  and  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , SEC Associate\nDirector Gregg E. Berman has said. The SEC\u2019s feed includes every\ndisplayed order for shares on exchanges, not just the best\noffers reported to the public tape. It also gathers data on\norders that are modified, canceled or filled.  One of the first reports to be published will present\ninformation on whether stock-market liquidity is affected by the\nhigh volume of orders that are canceled before being filled,\nwhich can give the false appearance of real bids and offers for\nstocks. Some automated strategies may cancel more than 90\npercent of the orders they send to exchanges, the SEC said in a\n2010  report .  Better Decisions  \u201cPeople have questioned the fact that there are so many\norder cancellations and that there is a relatively small\nfraction of orders from certain market players that get\nexecuted,\u201d former SEC Chairman Elisse B. Walter said last week\nin a phone interview. \u201cTo have better data analysis about that\nis going to help the SEC in making a policy decision about\nwhether or not that presents a problem and, if so, what to do\nabout it.\u201d  Midas allows the SEC to view what exchanges and some high-speed traders already know about markets, Berman said in a June\nspeech at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets\nAssociation\u2019s Tech conference. It\u2019s not a perfect view of market\nsurveillance, because it doesn\u2019t show the SEC how orders are\nrouted or include information about the brokers or customers\nbehind trades, Berman said.  Berman is leading the SEC\u2019s effort to analyze Midas data\nand publish analyses based on findings. It\u2019s not clear when the\nSEC will publish its first report, but the two people said it\nwould be soon.  In a phone interview last week, Berman declined to discuss\nspecific reports or when they would be made public. He said each\nanalysis began as a research project that his staff has worked\nto translate for a general audience.  \u2018Shed Light\u2019  \u201cWe focus on using this data in ways that makes sense to\nunderstand market structure,\u201d Berman said. \u201cThis is all around\nhelping people better understand markets and shed light on a\nvariety of different topics.\u201d  The decision to present research from Midas began under\nWalter, who said in a February speech that the reports would\nexplore subjects such as the speed of quotes and subsequent\ncancellations. The information could help people understand the\nimpact of new rules sought by critics of high-frequency trading,\nsaid Walter, who left the agency in August after serving a five-year term as a commissioner and chairman.  Midas gives the SEC a view into market behavior that some\nof the most sophisticated trading firms don\u2019t have, Berman said\nin a speech in June. The data allows the regulator to study the\nspeed at which traders respond to quotes, as well as what\nfraction of orders are canceled \u201cwithin 1 second, 100\nmilliseconds, or even 10 microseconds,\u201d Berman said in the June\nspeech.  \u2018Starting Point\u2019  \u201cAnswering these basic factual questions must be the\nstarting point for any serious dialogue about market speed, and\nI\u2019m very glad we now have the tools and technology to be able to\ndo so,\u201d Berman said in the speech.  Canadian regulators have similarly used a data-driven\napproach as they seek to analyze the role of high-frequency\ntraders, said  Adam Sussman , director of research at New York-based Tabb Group LLC. The Investment Industry Regulatory\nOrganization of  Canada  has used its real-time market\nsurveillance database to identify traders who produce a high\nnumber of orders relative to the number of trades that were\nconsummated, Sussman said in a phone interview.  The Canadian regulator\u2019s study found that high-frequency\ntrading accounted for one-fifth of all trading in that country\nand 94 percent of order messages.  Providing different types of aggregated market data to the\npublic is a good thing, said Haoxiang Zhu, assistant professor\nof finance at  Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2019s  Sloan\nSchool of Management  who specializes in market structure issues.  \u201cMany everyday investors, and even some smaller\ninstitutions, have little idea how their stock orders are\nrouted, for example, let alone the complexity of market\nstructure,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cMore transparency\non the structure of markets can only help.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nDave Michaels in Washington at \n dmichaels5@bloomberg.net ;\nSam Mamudi in  New York  at \n smamudi@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Maura Reynolds  at \n mreynolds34@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. was 27.928577423095703 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. was ",
