 "context": "The following article called 'Bank of America Said to Raise $300 Million LCM CLO' was published on 2010-11-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of America Corp.  has raised a\n$300 million collateralized loan obligation for LCM Asset\nManagement LLC as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates at\nrecord lows, driving investors to seek higher-yielding assets.  The top-ranked portion, a $197 million slice rated AAA by\nStandard & Poor\u2019s, priced to pay lenders 160 basis points more\nthan the London interbank offered rate, said two people familiar\nwith the transaction, who declined to be identified because the\ntalks are private. LCM, based in New York, is owned by  Tetragon\nFinancial Group Ltd.   The market for CLOs, a type of collateralized debt\nobligation that pool leveraged loans and slice them into\nsecurities of varying risk, is reviving after sales evaporated\nduring the credit crisis. Prices of CLO pieces and the\nunderlying debt have climbed this year as default rates declined\nand the Fed took measures to boost the economy, including a plan\nannounced this week to buy $600 billion of Treasuries through\nJune.  \u201cThe Fed\u2019s $600 billion supertanker pulled risky markets\nup,\u201d JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by  Rishad Ahluwalia \nwrote in a report today.  CLO debt rated A by S&P has gained 3 cents on the dollar to\n75 cents since Oct. 28; BBB slices rose 5 cents to 70 cents and\nthose ranked BB improved 8 cents to 60 cents, according to the\nJPMorgan report.  Loan Index  The Standard & Poor\u2019s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100  Index \ngained 0.34 cent to 91.87 since the Nov. 3 announcement. The\nindex, which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-\nlien leveraged loans, is trading at the highest level since May\n6 and ended 2009 at 87.68 cents on the dollar.  Carissa Ramirez , a spokeswoman for Tetragon, and Danielle\nRobinson, a Bank of America spokeswoman, declined to comment.  The LCM CLO also consists of a $23 million piece ranked AA,\na $26 million piece graded A and a $14 million piece rated BBB.\nThere is also $40 million of subordinated notes, the people\nsaid.  The lowest-ranking portion, some of which was sold to\noutside investors in addition to Tetragon, pays 5 percentage\npoints more than Libor, according to the people familiar with\nthe deal. Libor is the rate banks charge to lend to each other.  There have been $1.3 billion of U.S. CLOs backed by widely\nsyndicated loans issued this year through October, compared with\n$1.2 billion for all of last year, Morgan Stanley data show. In\n2007 about $91.1 billion of that type of CLO was issued in the\nU.S.  Apollo Global Management LLC , WCAS Fraser Sullivan\nInvestment Management LLC, an investment firm backed by Welsh\nCarson Anderson & Stowe, and Doral Money Inc., along with Babson\nCapital Management LLC as the collateral adviser, have completed\nCLOs this year.  JPMorgan may price a CLO for Apollo next week and Bank of\nAmerica may complete a deal for GSO Capital Partners LP, the\ncredit investment arm of Blackstone Group LP, the week of Nov.\n15, people familiar with the deals said in the past month.
