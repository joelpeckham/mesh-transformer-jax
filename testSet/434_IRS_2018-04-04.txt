 "context": "The following article called 'The Hot Debate: Can You Deduct Prepaid Property Taxes? | realtor.com\u00ae' was published on 2018-04-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe Wall Street Journal \nThen on Dec. 27, the Internal Revenue Service warned that not all prepayments of 2018 property taxes would be deductible on 2017 returns. The agency said that to qualify for a write-off, the tax liability actually had to have been known at the time . \nRight away, some tax specialists strongly agreed with the IRS but others strongly disagreed. The IRS and its supporters argued that those who prepaid all their 2018 property taxes can only deduct the portion that was known or determined at the time. In many cases, that means only for a few months of the year or not at all. \nThe IRS\u2019s opponents argued for higher deductions of reasonable estimates. They based this argument on prior tax rulings and regulations that they think apply to this issue. \nNow, three months later, little progress has been made. \nLeading the opposition against the IRS\u2019s position is Lawrence Axelrod, an attorney at Ivins, Phillips & Barker. \n\u201cThe IRS position is misguided because it doesn\u2019t take into account Treasury\u2019s own regulations,\u201d he said. \nThese regulations allow taxpayers to deduct amounts paid that will be due within 12 months. The IRS and its supporters disagree. They cite court decisions which say that to be deductible, taxes must have been imposed and the amount must be known. \nStephen Baxley, who heads tax planning for Bessemer Trust, a prominent multifamily office, agrees with Mr. Axelrod. \n\u201cIf the amount is a reasonable estimate made in good faith, it\u2019s deductible,\u201d he says. The firm is responsible for preparing nearly 1,000 individual returns. \nOther tax preparers agree with the IRS. \nBrian Lovett, a certified public accountant with WithumSmith+Brown in New Jersey, where property taxes tend to be high, says his firm is following the IRS\u2019s guidance: \u201cWe think the amount due must be determined for a prepayment to be deductible.\u201d \nThe correct answer matters. \nMore than 80% of property-tax revenue is collected by local governments with a fiscal year other than Dec. 31, according to the latest data compiled by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. Frequently, the fiscal year ends on June 30. \nAs a result, total property tax bills for 2018 weren\u2019t determined by year-end in many areas of the country. Many could reasonably be estimated, however. \nFor example, say John lives in a county with a fiscal year ending June 30. By the end of 2017, he knew he would owe $6,500 in property tax due by June 30, 2018. He could likely assume that his bill for the second half of 2018 would be about the same. So in late December, he prepaid $13,000 for 2018 to his county. \nAccording to the IRS\u2019s position, John can only deduct a prepayment of $6,500\u2014because the amount due for the second half of the year hadn\u2019t been set. \nBut if Jane lives elsewhere and knew she would actually owe $13,000 in property tax for 2018, she can deduct a prepayment of that amount on her 2017 return. \nSome advisers allow both approaches. David Lifson, a CPA with Crowe Horwath who has many high-earning clients, says he recommends that clients deduct prepayments of known amounts. But he will allow a deduction of an estimate, \u201cif I feel the client understands the risk that the IRS will disagree.\u201d \nThe debate is ongoing. In March, Democrats on the Ways & Means Committee wrote acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter to protest the IRS\u2019s interpretation of the law. \nThe good news for taxpayers who want to deduct prepayments of estimates is that neither Mr. Lifson nor Mr. Baxley thinks these write-offs need to be disclosed on IRS Form 8275. On it, taxpayers are supposed to disclose risky positions to avoid certain penalties. Supporters of the IRS\u2019s position think the form should be filed, however. \nSome taxpayers are also pushing preparers to take the deduction because the audit risk is low, given constraints on IRS resources. \nEmily Matthews, a CPA with Edelstein & Co. in Boston, says she explains the IRS\u2019s position to clients. But she says, \u201cI think we\u2019ll see a lot of people who prepaid estimated taxes opt to deduct them.\u201d Popular Homes Based on your last search Editors' Picks \n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of IRSA Inversiones Y Representaciones S.A. was 24.329999923706055 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of IRSA Inversiones Y Representaciones S.A. was ",
