 "context": "The following article called 'Wal-Mart Should Say Who Returned Pay in Mexico Mess' was published on 2013-06-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmid the investigations into alleged\nbribery at  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) \u2019s Mexico unit, some shareholders\nare demanding the company show whether it is holding senior\nmanagement accountable.  That\u2019s why a number of global investment and pension funds\nled by the  United Auto Workers  Retiree Medical Benefits Trust\nhave filed a proposal asking Wal-Mart to disclose whether the\ncompany has reclaimed the pay of executives found responsible\nfor serious and costly misconduct. The proposal, which has\nreceived the backing of the proxy advisory firms Institutional\nShareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co., will go to a vote at\nthe company\u2019s shareholder meeting on June 7.  For large companies with far-flung operations, some\nmisconduct is inevitable. There is simply no way to police the\nactions of hundreds of thousands (in Wal-Mart\u2019s case, millions)\nof employees. Wal-Mart isn\u2019t immune to this problem. The\nimportant thing is that those responsible are held to account --\nand that such efforts are made transparent, so that the misdeeds\ndon\u2019t become larger or systemic.  Predictable Response  Wal-Mart\u2019s  response  to the proposal has been predictable.\nThe company says it has strong policies to claw back pay from\nexecutives who engaged in wrongdoing. But it hasn\u2019t said whether\nthese policies have ever been invoked, despite having some of\nthem in place for more than a decade.  Policies to recover or cancel compensation to an executive\nfound to have engaged in misconduct play a much larger role in\ncorporate governance today than they did before the financial\ncrisis of 2008, when bankers reaped large short-term profits on\ntrades that later pushed the companies they worked for to the\nverge of insolvency, requiring government bailouts. Most big\ncompanies now have these policies in place, with the idea being\nthat employees won\u2019t aim for short-term gains that prove to be\nillusory if some of their past pay can be reclaimed by their\nemployer.  Pending controversies aside, Wal-Mart in fact has one of\nthe most rigorous clawback policies in the corporate world,\nwhich allows for both forfeiture of compensation for any conduct\nthat violates the company\u2019s code of ethics and the recapture of\ncompensation already paid or not yet granted. But Wal-Mart\ndoesn\u2019t provide  investors  with information on whether the board\nhas actually enforced the policy.  Without this information, these policies lose their\neffectiveness, particularly if some employees interpret a lack\nof disclosure as management indifference to unethical behavior.\nSome companies argue that disclosure of reclaimed compensation\nis already required under rules mandating public reporting of\npay for certain senior executives. But disclosure rules that\napply to just a few executives in large multinationals with\nhundreds of thousands of employees and numerous business\nsegments are inadequate.  Investors want greater disclosure. Consider the positive\nresponse when JPMorgan Chase & Co. announced that it had\nrecouped pay from those employees responsible for the London\nWhale trading losses.  So far, Wal-Mart has spent more than $200 million on the\ncorruption investigations and expects to incur significant costs\nin the future. Should the disclosure proposal receive\nsubstantial support, Wal-Mart might realize that a little\nsunlight can go a long way.  (Charles M.
