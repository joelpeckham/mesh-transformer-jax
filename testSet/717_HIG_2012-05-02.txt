 "context": "The following article called 'Hartford Profit Falls 81% on Hedging Losses as Yen Weakens' was published on 2012-05-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHartford Financial Services Group\nInc. (HIG) , the seller of life insurance and property-casualty\ncoverage, said profit fell 81 percent on realized losses tied to\nhedges against a stronger yen and stock market drops.  First-quarter  net income  dropped to $96 million, or 18\ncents a share, from $501 million, or 99 cents, according to a\nstatement today from Hartford, which is based in the Connecticut\ncity of the same name. Operating earnings, which exclude some\ninvestment results, were $1.25 per share, beating by 34 cents\nthe average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Liam McGee hedges against a\nstronger yen and declines in stock markets to guard against\nlosses on contracts with Japanese clients in which the insurer\nguarantees minimum returns on equity-linked investments. The yen\nweakened 7.2 percent against the dollar in the first quarter and\n Japan \u2019s  Nikkei 225 Index (NKY)  jumped 19 percent.  \u201cLosses increased in the first quarter of 2012 due\nprimarily to depreciation of the yen in relation to the euro and\n U.S. dollar  and an improvement in global and domestic equity\nmarkets,\u201d Hartford said in the statement.  The net realized loss of runoff operations, which include\nthe Japanese annuity market where Hartford no longer sells new\npolicies, widened to $587 million from $170 million.  Policy Sales  Policy sales climbed 3 percent in the commercial property-\ncasualty coverage business to $1.69 billion, while they declined\n3 percent to $861 million in the consumer markets segment, which\nprovides auto and homeowners coverage to individuals.  Hartford\u2019s book value, a measure of  assets  minus\nliabilities, fell to $43.25 a share from $44.31 as of Dec. 31,\nthe company said in a regulatory filing.  McGee is shrinking the firm as he fends off calls from\nbillionaire hedge-fund manager  John Paulson , his biggest\ninvestor, to break the company in two after a 39 percent stock\nplunge in 2011. McGee is seeking buyers for life insurance and\nretirement plan units and Woodbury Financial Services. Hartford\nagreed to sell its individual annuities distribution business to\nForethought Financial Group Inc., the insurer said April 26.  \u201cThere\u2019s been significant pressure from the folks at\nPaulson to try and come up with something that will allow for a\nmore rapid benefit to shareholders,\u201d  Meyer Shields , an analyst\nat Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said by phone before the results were\nannounced. Hartford\u2019s vision for the restructuring is \u201cpretty\nclear and pretty final. It\u2019s just a matter of executing on it.\u201d  Share Rebound  Hartford  gained  26 percent this year to $20.43 at 4:01 p.m.\nin  New York , after slumping 39 percent in 2011. Hartford has had\nthe second-biggest advance in the 24-company KBW Insurance Index\nthis year. Results were released after the close of regular\ntrading. The shares slipped to $20.35 as of 4:53 p.m. in trading\nafter regular hours.  Hartford needs to reach about $24.70 to recoup Paulson\u2019s\ninvestment, filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission and data compiled by Bloomberg in February show.  Paulson\u2019s fund  controls  about 8.5 percent of Hartford,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. He said in February\nthat the company should be split to free Hartford\u2019s property-\ncasualty business from  life insurance  and the risks associated\nwith annuity liabilities.
