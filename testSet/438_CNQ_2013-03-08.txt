 "context": "The following article called 'Canada Heavy Oil Jumps Most Since September as Output Slumps' was published on 2013-03-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCanadian heavy oil strengthened the\nmost in almost six months on the  spot market  as weaker-than-\nexpected output eased concern that lower refinery demand in the\nspring will keep the grade under pressure.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  reported fourth-quarter\nproduction yesterday of 592,080 barrels-of-oil equivalent, 12\npercent below the average estimate of seven analyst polled by\nBloomberg. Other oil sands projects including Syncrude also\nreported lower-than-expected production this month. The company\nsaid it accounted for 53 percent of the Western Canadian Select\nblend in 2012.  \u201cThe new information that the market is reacting to is\nthat producers are indicating that their production is a little\nbit more subdued than expected,\u201d said Judith Dwarkin, chief\nenergy economist at ITG Investment Research Inc. \u201cWhat the\nprice is telling you is that the market balance is a lot tighter\nthan what a lot of people were positioning for.\u201d  WCS, a heavy blend of diluted oil-sands bitumen,\nstrengthened $3.75 a barrel to $20 a barrel below U.S. benchmark\nWest Texas Intermediate crude at 1:57 p.m.  New York  time,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the strongest\none-day move since Sept. 18, and the smallest discount for the\ngrade since Oct. 22.  Rising production and limited pipeline space has put\npressure on the price of Canadian heavy oil over the last\nseveral months, with Western  Canada  Select reaching a record\ndiscount of $42.50 a barrel on Dec. 14.  Constraints Eased  Less output from projects this winter has eased the\npipeline constraints.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  export pipelines to the\nMidwest from Canada were not apportioned in March, the company\nsaid in a Feb. 21 e-mail. Export lines 4 and 67 carrying a\ncombined 1.25 million barrels a day were apportioned for five\nmonths through February, meaning there wasn\u2019t enough space to\nmeet all requests to transport oil.  Midwest refinery maintenance this spring was also expected\nto reduce the demand for heavy crude. Plants that process heavy\ncrude imports from Canada were said to have scheduled\nmaintenance for April and May, including  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) \u2019s\n238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet,  Illinois , units and  Calumet\nSpecialty Products Partners (CLMT) \u2019 45,000-barrel-a-day refinery in\nSuperior, Wisconsin.  Exxon\u2019s Joliet refinery will shut down for five weeks of\nmaintenance starting in mid-April, a person familiar with the\nmatter said. Calumet said it will close its Superior refinery\nlate in the first quarter for about three weeks of work.
