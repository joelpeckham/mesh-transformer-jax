The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStandard & Poor\u2019s may face widening litigation over credit ratings during the housing boom as states investigate the company and consider bringing new cases that would add to more than a dozen across the country.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley are conducting probes of S&P, which has been accused by the U.S. of defrauding investors.  Their investigations threaten the  McGraw-Hill Cos (MHP) . unit with broader litigation after the Justice Department sued the company this week with 13 states and the District of Columbia.  Connecticut , Illinois and  Mississippi  had earlier filed lawsuits.  \u201cWe\u2019ll likely see other state attorneys general joining the fray and jumping in on these lawsuits,\u201d said Robert Mintz, an attorney at  McCarter & English LLP (1389L)  and a former federal prosecutor. \u201cWhenever you have company like S&P that does business around the country, it gives each individual state a bite at the apple.\u201d  Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen, who is leading the multistate coalition, said in an interview that additional states are \u201cactively considering\u201d filing lawsuits. He declined to comment on how many.  Banks Favored  The Justice Department sued S&P on Feb. 4,  saying  that the company downplayed and disregarded the risk posed by the mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations and issued inflated ratings on CDOs. S&P was driven by a desire to increase revenue and market share and was favoring the interests of investment banks that sold the securities at the expense of investors, the government said.  S&P rated more than $2.8 trillion worth of residential mortgage-backed securities and almost $1.2 trillion worth of collateralized debt obligations from September 2004 to October 2007, according to the complaint. Federally insured financial institutions suffered $5 billion in losses on CDOs rated by S&P, the Justice Department said in a statement.  S&P called the U.S. and state lawsuits \u201cmeritless\u201d and said its ratings reflected the company\u2019s best judgments, according to a statement.  California  Attorney General Kamala Harris claimed in that state\u2019s lawsuit that two public pension funds, the California Public Employees Retirement System and the California State Teachers Retirement System, relied on S&P\u2019s ratings and lost hundreds of millions of dollars when the housing market collapsed, according to the complaint.  \u2018Corrupted\u2019 Ratings  \u201cS&P corrupted its ratings\u2019 process to curry favor with large banks, which paid S&P billions of dollars in return,\u201d Harris\u2019 office said in the complaint. \u201cIn other words, S&P claimed to be a gatekeeper, but it acted like a toll collector.\u201d  Other states that filed lawsuits with the Justice Department were:  Arizona ,  Arkansas ,  Colorado ,  Delaware ,  Idaho ,  Iowa , North Carolina,  Maine , Missouri,  Pennsylvania ,  Tennessee  and  Washington , according to a statement from Connecticut.  The states are seeking disgorgement of what S&P earned from the scheme, Jepsen said.  \u201cIn theory, the collective disgorgement would be for hundreds of millions from ill-gotten gains, but there could be fines and penalties above that,\u201d he said.  Moody\u2019s, Fitch  Schneiderman is investigating whether S&P, Moody\u2019s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings violated a 2008 settlement that was reached with his predecessor Andrew Cuomo that resolved a state investigation into ratings, according to a person familiar with the matter. The investigation includes a probe into potential misconduct by the three companies since the settlements expired in 2011, said the person, who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified.  In the settlement with Cuomo, now New York\u2019s governor, the companies agreed to a series of reforms, including changes to their fee structures, disclosures about loan pools, reviews of mortgage originators and annual reviews of processes for practices that could compromise independent ratings.  Schneiderman, who is helping lead a group of state and federal officials investigating misconduct in the bundling of mortgage loans into securities, last year sued  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Credit Suisse Group AG over mortgage bonds sold to investors.  Massachusetts Probe  Coakley, the Massachusetts attorney general, is also investigating S&P, said Brad Puffer, a spokesman for her office, in an e-mail.  \u201cOur office is engaged in our own related investigation into this matter and we are closely monitoring this lawsuit filed by other attorneys general,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThese are serious allegations.\u201d  Mintz, the former prosecutor, said S&P may try to reach a global settlement to resolve all the lawsuits.  \u201cIt\u2019s costly to fight the battle on multiple fronts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you run the risk of getting inconsistent rulings by judges around the country.\u201d  The U.S. case is U.S. v. McGraw-Hill, 13-00779, U.S. District Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles).
