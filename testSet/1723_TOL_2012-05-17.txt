 "context": "The following article called 'Asian Stocks Rise on Japan Growth, Fed Stimulus Optimism' was published on 2012-05-17. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAsian  stocks  rose, with the regional\ngauge poised to end a six-day losing streak, as faster-than-\nestimated economic growth in Japan and optimism the  Federal\nReserve  will do more to stimulate the  U.S. economy  outweighed\nconcern Greece\u2019s debt crisis is worsening.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., rose\n1.8 percent.  Korea Gas Corp. (036460)  jumped 6.4 percent in Seoul after a\ngas discovery in Mozambique. Toshiba Corp., the maker of Regza\nbrand televisions, gained 5.6 percent in  Tokyo  after saying it\nwill stop television production in Japan.  Toll Holdings Ltd. (TOL) , an\nAustralian trucking company, slid 6.8 percent, extending\nyesterday\u2019s losses after forecasting lower full-year profit.  \u201cWe may see a huge buy-back if we see some end to Europe\u2019s\npolitical turmoil and people realize that stocks in Asia are\ncheap given their strong economies,\u201d said Koji Toda, chief  fund\nmanager  at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees about $68\nbillion. \u201cThe Fed is giving a signal to the market that there\u2019s\nno need for panic, by assuring it will do something before\nthings get really bad.\u201d  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 0.6 percent to 114.97 as\nof 7:59 p.m. in Tokyo, after falling as much as 0.2 percent.\nMore than twice as many stocks rose as fell on the measure,\nwhich yesterday closed more than 10 percent below its Feb. 29\nhigh, a retreat some traders call a correction.  Concern about Europe\u2019s crisis drove the MSCI Asia Pacific\nIndex down for the past six days, dragging the gauge to its\nlowest level since Jan. 2, as markets in South Korea and Hong\nKong entered a so-called correction from their recent highs. The\n European Central Bank  said it will temporarily stop lending to\nsome Greek banks to limit its risk as President Mario Draghi\nsignaled the ECB won\u2019t compromise on key principles to keep\nGreece in the euro area.  Japanese Growth  Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.9 percent after the\nCabinet Office reported the nation\u2019s economy grew an annualized\n4.1 percent in the first quarter, exceeding the 3.5 percent\nestimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 Index declined 0.2 percent and\nSouth Korea\u2019s Kospi Index rose 0.3 percent.

A\ngovernment report showed gross domestic product rose an\nannualized 10 percent in the three months through March 31 from\nthe previous quarter.  Fed Minutes  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index is about 1 percent away from\nerasing this year\u2019s gains. That compares with a 5.3 percent\nincrease by the  S&P 500  and a drop of less than 1 percent for\nthe Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are\nvalued at 11.7 times estimated earnings on average, compared\nwith a multiple of 12.6 for the S&P 500 and 10.1 times for the\nStoxx 600.  The uncertainty in  Greece  \u201cseems likely to confine equity\nmarkets to several weeks of nervous limbo,\u201d said  Michael Kurtz ,\nhead of global equity strategy at Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan\u2019s\nlargest brokerage. \u201cWe will look back on this juncture as an\nextraordinary buying opportunity even if events ultimately\nconspire to eject Greece from the euro.\u201d  In the U.S., several Federal Reserve policy makers said a\nloss of momentum in growth or increased risks to their economic\noutlook could warrant additional action to keep the recovery\ngoing, minutes of their last meeting showed.  Li & Fung gained 1.8 percent to HK$14.44 in Hong Kong,\nwhile Techtronic Industries Co., maker of Ryobi power tools and\nHoover vacuum cleaners, advanced 2.3 percent to HK$8.82.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.1 percent\ntoday. The index slipped 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday as\nconcern that Greece\u2019s debt crisis is worsening offset better-\nthan-estimated reports on U.S. housing starts and industrial\nproduction.

Toshiba rose 5.6 percent to 322 yen in Tokyo. The company\nhalted output at its sole domestic TV factory in Saitama, north\nof Tokyo, sometime in the year ended March 31, a spokesman,\nAtsushi Ido, said by phone today.  \u201cIt\u2019s the right strategy,\u201d said  Mitsushige Akino , who\noversees about $600 million at Ichiyoshi Investment Management\nCo. in Tokyo. \u201cThe company should just abandon overseas TV\nproduction altogether and have them built by Chinese or\nTaiwanese companies.\u201d  Link REIT (823) , a shopping-center operator in Hong Kong, dropped\n4.4 percent to HK$29.35 after a report an investor is selling as\nmuch as HK$1.98 billion ($255 million) of its shares.
