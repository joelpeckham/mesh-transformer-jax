 "context": "The following article called 'Delta Beats Profit Estimates as Ticket Prices Rise' was published on 2013-10-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDelta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  rose to a six-year high after the carrier posted third-quarter profit that\nbeat analysts\u2019 estimates as more people flew at higher fares and\nfuel prices declined.  The shares, already the top performer this year among major\nU.S. carriers, climbed to $25.49, the highest close since April\n2007. Earnings excluding some costs and gains were $1.2 billion,\nor $1.41 a share, the Atlanta-based airline said in a statement\ntoday, exceeding the $1.35 average of 15 estimates compiled by\nBloomberg.  Delta, the world\u2019s second-largest airline, has been working\nto control costs under a 2012 plan to cut $1 billion over two\nyears, with steps such as retiring older jets and replacing\ninefficient 50-seaters with larger planes. Rising ticket prices\nare helping reap more revenue from each passenger flown a mile.  \u201cAll things considered -- a weak job environment, a weak\neconomy -- there is still pretty good demand for  air travel ,\u201d\n Bob Mann , president of aviation consultant R.W. Mann & Co. in\n Port Washington ,  New York , said in an interview. \u201cThose who are\nmost adversely affected are clearly not in the market, but those\nwho are outside that group seem to be spending and willing to\ntolerate the price increases and fees out there.\u201d  Delta shares rose 3.2 percent at the close in New York and\nhave more than doubled this year. The 10-carrier Bloomberg U.S.\nAirlines Index climbed 2.2 percent to its highest close since\nOctober 2007. In the index, Delta\u2019s gain this year trails only\nthe 140 percent jump for  Spirit Airlines Inc. (SAVE) , a discounter\nwhose fleet is less than 1/10th as large.  Profit Outlook  \u201cWe expect to set an all-time profit record for Delta in\n2013 and in turn expect to improve on that performance in\n2014,\u201d Chief Executive Officer  Richard Anderson  said on a\nconference call.  Delta forecast an operating margin improvement in a range\nof 7 percent to 9 percent this quarter from a year earlier.  \u201cOur numbers for the quarter are closer to 7,\u201d  Michael Derchin , a CRT Capital Group LLC analyst in  Stamford ,\n Connecticut , said in an interview. \u201cIf they end up being closer\nto the high end, that means the entire quarter is going to come\nin better. We should have a really nice fourth quarter.\u201d  Derchin recommends buying Delta shares.  Delta said the temporary shutdown of the U.S. government\nthis month reduced October revenue by as much as $25 million.  Fleet Costs  Net income  rose 31 percent to $1.37 billion, or $1.59 a\nshare, from $1.05 billion, or $1.23, a year earlier, Delta said.\nThe third quarter included $128 million in costs, mainly for\n\u201cdomestic fleet restructuring,\u201d and a $285 million gain\nrelated to fuel hedges, Delta said.  Sales rose 5.7 percent to $10.5 billion, led by gains in\nthe U.S. and across the Atlantic.  Delta said its price paid per gallon of  jet fuel  fell\n5.4 percent in the quarter, helped by production from the\nairline\u2019s Trainer oil refinery. The refinery, bought last year,\nhad a $3 million operating profit, the company said. Yield, or\naverage fare per mile, climbed 4.6 percent.  Delta today told employees it will reduce unprofitable\nservice further at  Memphis ,  Tennessee , a former hub, to about\n40 peak-day flights as of Dec. 3. The change will eliminate 186\nflight attendant jobs and 126 airport and cargo positions.\nWorkers affected will be offered transfers with paid relocation,\nvoluntary furlough or voluntary retirement, Delta said.  Delta and five other largest U.S. carriers are expected to\nreport combined third-quarter net income of $2.6 billion, more\nthan twice that of a year earlier, according to Savanthi Syth, a\nRaymond James Financial Inc. analyst. Travel demand that didn\u2019t\ndrop in the usually slow month of September helped boost sales.  American Airlines parent AMR Corp. reported net income of\n$289 million and a 6.2 percent increase in sales last week. US\nAirways Group Inc. reports results tomorrow, followed by United\nContinental Holdings Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. on Oct. 24.\nJetBlue Airways Corp. is set for Oct. 29.
