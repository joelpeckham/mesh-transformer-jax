 "context": "The following article called 'Venezuela Bonds Gain as Chavez Rival Wins Primary Landslide: Caracas Mover' was published on 2012-02-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nVenezuelan bonds rallied after\nopposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski won more than 60\npercent of the vote in a nationwide primary, a margin of victory\nthat analysts said could strengthen his bid to unseat President\n Hugo Chavez  in October elections.  The yield on  Venezuela \u2019s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds due\nin 2027 fell 30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage point, to 11.80\npercent, the lowest since April 2010, at 3:30 p.m. in New York,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond\u2019s price rose\n1.75 cents to 82 cents on the dollar.  Capriles, a 39-year-old governor of Miranda state who\npromises to gradually unwind Chavez-imposed state controls on\nthe economy, won the South American country\u2019s first presidential\nprimary with 1.8 million votes. The margin of victory and\nstronger-than-expected voter turnout of almost 3 million people\nincrease the possibility of a \u201cdemocratic and peaceful\ntransition\u201d in 2013, providing support to Venezuelan assets,\nBarclays Plc said in a note to clients.  \u201cThe global risk rally has helped Venezuelan bonds but the\npolitical issue is beginning to be a catalyst that could give\nthem more of a boost,\u201d Alejandro Arreaza, an analyst at\nBarclays in  New York , said in a telephone interview. \u201cEven\nthough Capriles is behind in polls for the presidential\nelection, with this momentum he could close the gap quickly and\nhe emerges as a strong leader of a unified opposition.\u201d  Pablo Perez, who had 30 percent of the vote, and Maria\nCorina Machado, with about 5 percent of the vote, both announced\ntheir support for Capriles after yesterday\u2019s primary.  Yield Spread  Chavez, 57, has said that he will win a third-consecutive\nsix-year term in presidential elections on Oct. 7 regardless of\nwho the opposition candidate is. He says that he\u2019s now \u201ccancer\nfree\u201d after having a tumor removed in June and receiving\nchemotherapy treatment late last year.  The extra yield investors demand to own Venezuelan bonds\nover U.S. Treasuries narrowed 39 basis points to 1,045 today,\nthe lowest level on a closing basis since May 2010, according to\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBI Global index. That compares to a 30\nbasis point drop for  Argentina  and a 12 basis point decline on\naverage in  Latin America .  Venezuela has the highest borrowing costs of emerging-\nmarket countries in the EMBI Global after Belize and  Pakistan .  Bonds of state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA\nalso surged today. The yield on PDVSA\u2019s 4.9 percent bonds due in\n2014 fell 51 basis points to 10.72 percent today, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. The bond\u2019s price rose 1.08 cents to\n86.66 cents on the dollar.  \u2018Temporary Boost\u2019  \u201cWe expect a post-nomination boost in Capriles\u2019 poll\nnumbers, but also expect this boost to be temporary,\u201d  Francisco Rodriguez , an economist at Bank of America Corp. in New York,\nsaid in a note to clients. \u201cWe continue to see a Chavez victory\nin the October elections as the most likely scenario.\u201d  Nationally, Chavez was leading voter preferences with 47.3\npercent support, compared with 44.9 percent for Capriles,\naccording to a December poll by Caracas-based Consultores 21,\npublished by Barclays in a separate note to clients. The report\ndid not specify dates or a margin of error for the survey.  The cost of protecting Venezuelan debt against non-payment\nfor five years with credit-default swaps fell 28 basis points to\n794, according to data compiled by CMA in  London . Credit-default\nswaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying\nsecurities or the cash equivalent should a government or company\nfail to adhere to its debt agreements.  \u2018Country in Crisis\u2019  While pledging to reverse some of Chavez\u2019s economic\npolicies that have fueled an inflation rate of 26 percent, the\nhighest of 78 countries tracked by Bloomberg, and left the\neconomy dependent on oil-financed fiscal spending, Capriles has\nsaid the process would be gradual. He\u2019s cited the more than 70\nfree health clinics in poor neighborhoods of Miranda and a\nsubsidized food program for low-income families as proof of how\nhe\u2019d continue a more efficient version of Chavez\u2019s social\ninitiatives.  \u201cOur country is in crisis and we have a government that\nonly cares about politics,\u201d Capriles said last night in his\nvictory speech in front of thousands of supporters waving flags\nand dancing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take this country into the 21st\ncentury.\u201d  Capriles has said that he\u2019d temporarily maintain currency\ncontrols to avoid a plunge in the bolivar and leave subsidized\ngasoline prices unchanged.  \u2018Market Positive\u2019  \u201cThe result, although somewhat expected, is still market\npositive,\u201d  Alberto Ramos , an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group\nInc., said in a note to clients following yesterday\u2019s vote.\n\u201cPresident Chavez will face in October perhaps the most serious\nchallenge to his hitherto solid grip on power, the economy, and\nthe country overall.\u201d  Investors will probably begin to focus on polling data now\nto gauge Capriles\u2019 momentum in a head-to-head race against\nChavez and the president\u2019s public appearances as he recovers\nfrom cancer, Alfredo Viegas, managing director of  emerging\nmarkets  at  Knight Capital  in Greenwich,  Connecticut , said in a\ntelephone interview.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to phase into poll watching mentality and if\nit starts to show some significant momentum past the high 40\npercent levels, that\u2019s going to galvanize the market more,\u201d\nViegas said. \u201cThere\u2019s potential for the  risk premium  to erode\nsignificantly, especially where similarly trading emerging\nmarket dollar sovereigns are trading.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nDaniel Cancel in Caracas at \n dcancel@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDavid Papadopoulos at \n papadopoulos@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 28.58665657043457 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
