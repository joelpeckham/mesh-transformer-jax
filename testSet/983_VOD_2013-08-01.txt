The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTelefonica SA (TEF) \u2019s O2 will introduce\nfaster, fourth-generation wireless services in the U.K. at the\nend of this month, becoming EE\u2019s first challenger.  The subscriptions will be available in London, Leeds and\nBradford on Aug. 29, followed by 10 additional cities by the end\nof the year, O2 said in a statement.  Already behind their counterparts in Germany,  Sweden  and\nthe U.S., carriers in the U.K. are rushing to build 4G networks,\nwhich command a higher price for services and let customers\nstream video and television shows on tablets and mobile phones.\nEE, a venture of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  and  Orange SA (ORA) , has had a\nnine-month headstart, winning about 700,000 4G customers.  O2 said its 4G plans will start at 26 pounds ($40) a month.\nEE\u2019s cheapest 2-year plan for contract customers also costs 26\npounds a month and comes with a free smartphone and 500\nmegabytes of data. EE\u2019s so-called SIM-only plans, which don\u2019t\ninclude devices, start at 21 pounds a month. O2 didn\u2019t give\nadditional details for its price plans.  \u201cOver half of our customers say they use more data than\ntwo years ago and even more use Wi-Fi wherever they go, to\nalways stay connected,\u201d O2 Chief Executive Officer Ronan Dunne\nsaid in the statement.  Clearing Airwaves  Ofcom, the U.K. telecommunications regulator, yesterday\nsaid it had finished clearing the airwaves in the 800 megahertz\nfrequency band used by O2, removing interfering signals like\ndigital TV channels and wireless microphones. As part of the\nlicense rules, Telefonica must reach 98 percent of indoor\ncoverage in the U.K. by 2017.  EE received regulatory approval in 2012 to use its licenses\nin the 1,800 megahertz band of spectrum, which was already clear\nfor use, allowing it to offer 4G ahead of Telefonica and\n Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , its two biggest competitors.  The U.K. government raised 2.34 billion pounds from five\nbidders for the spectrum in February. Newbury, England-based\nVodafone bought the most, spending 790.8 million pounds, and has\nsaid it will offer 4G service by the end of the summer.\nTelefonica spent 550 million pounds. Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.\u2019s 3\nunit and  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  also paid for licenses.
