 "context": "The following article called 'Iron Ore-Shipping Costs Plunge 47% This Year Amid China Slowdown Risks' was published on 2012-01-09. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe cost of hauling  iron ore  and coal\nfell to a four-month low, extending this year\u2019s decline to 47\npercent, amid concerns a Chinese economic slowdown will curb\nsteel production, the biggest driver of global shipping demand.  Rates to hire a capesize ship, the largest in the fleet of\ndry-bulk vessels, dropped 6.1 percent to $14,535 a day,\naccording to the London-based Baltic Exchange. That\u2019s less than\nhalf the 2011 high of $32,889 reached on Dec. 12, according to\nexchange data.  \u201cConcerns about a Chinese economic slowdown mean that\nthere are real risks to weaker Chinese  steel production (CHMMCRST)  growth\nin 2012, which the capesize sector is highly leveraged to,\u201d\nNatasha Boyden, an analyst at New York-based  Cantor Fitzgerald \nLP, wrote today in an e-mailed report.  The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of charter costs for four\nclasses of vessels, declined 2.9 percent to 1,308 points,\naccording to the exchange, which publishes rates for more than\n50 maritime routes. That\u2019s the lowest level since Aug. 15. The\ngauge has fallen 25 percent in 2012, as earnings for the other\nvessel types also declined, while at a lower pace than\ncapesizes.  A surge in new vessels being delivered from shipyards in\nJanuary will entrench hire costs for the fleet of 1,335 capesize\nships at current lows, Cantor Fitzgerald said. Rainy weather in\nAustralia and  Brazil , the largest exporters of iron ore, also\ncut  shipments (AUITIROV)  amid falling demand ahead of the Chinese New Year\nshutdown later this month, the investment bank said.  China \u2019s  steel production (IISICHIN)  has declined for six straight\nmonths, falling to 49.8 million metric tons in November,\naccording to the most recent data from the World Steel\nAssociation.  Seaborne Trade  Iron ore, coking coal used in steel making, and steel\nproducts account for 51 percent of dry-bulk seaborne trade,\nestimated at 3.4 billion tons in 2011, according to  Germany \u2019s\n DVB Bank SE (DVB) , which specializes in transportation lending. An\nestimated 63 percent of the 1-billion tons of ore shipped by sea\nin 2011 went to China, according to UBS AG.  There may be a \u201csignificant slowdown in the coming\nmonths\u201d in global steel production if the world economy slips\ninto recession, DVB said in a report Jan. 6. Chinese steel\nproduction was expected to expand 11.6 percent to 700 million\ntons in 2011, DVB forecast.  Weakening Chinese demand for ore in the past two weeks\ncontributed to the \u201cfreefall\u201d in the Baltic Dry Index, BOCOM\nInternational, a Hong Kong-based subsidiary of China\u2019s Bank of\nCommunications Co., said in a report today. The index will\naverage 1,250 to 1,300 this year, as much as 19 percent lower\nthan 2011, as the oversupply of new ships weighs on freight\nrates, BOCOM forecast.  Fleet Expansion  The dry bulk fleet will expand by 4.5 percent in the first\nsix months, driving hire costs lower,  Maritime Strategies\nInternational Ltd . said in a report e-mailed Jan. 6. Capesize\nrates won\u2019t rise, on average, until March when they\u2019ll reach\n$18,000 a day, the London-based shipping consultancy said.  Contracts used to bet on or hedge future ore-shipping costs\nfor the first quarter of 2012 traded at $12,750 a day by 3:36\np.m. in London, according to Clarkson Securities Ltd.  Panamaxes, the largest ships that navigate the Panama\nCanal, fell 2.1 percent to $12,020 a day, according to the\n Baltic Exchange . Supramax vessels, which carry about 25 percent\nless cargo than panamaxes, slid 1.2 percent to $11,487 a day,\nthe lowest rate since Feb. 8. Handysize ships, the smallest\ntracked by the index, fell 0.7 percent to $8,062.
