 "context": "The following article called 'Fed Bank Presidents Reveal Assets From Ranchland to Inflation-Linked Bonds' was published on 2012-02-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFederal Reserve regional bank\npresidents revealed unprecedented details about their personal\nwealth, disclosing  Citigroup Inc. (C)  shares bought by accident and\nownership of a Missouri farm and  Texas  ranchland.  The regional bank chiefs, who manage Fed operations across\nthe country ranging from bank supervision to emergency lending,\ndisclosed the documents yesterday in response to requests from\nBloomberg News under the Freedom of Information Act. The Fed\nbanks said they weren\u2019t subject to the terms of the act, even as\nthey responded to the requests.  The 12 regional banks and their presidents aren\u2019t held to\nthe same level of public scrutiny as the Washington-based\nFederal Reserve Board and its governors. While Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Fed governors disclose information about their\nfinances and are subject to the FOIA, the regional banks don\u2019t\nroutinely make personal financial information public.  \u201cWhen it comes to financial disclosures for Federal\nReserve bank presidents, this is a step in the right\ndirection,\u201d said Sung Won Sohn, former chief economist at Wells\nFargo & Co. who is now a professor at California State\nUniversity-Channel Islands in Camarillo. \u201cTransparency is very\nimportant,\u201d he said. \u201cPolicy makers will bend over backwards\nnow to not have even the appearance of impropriety.\u201d  The Fed\u2019s regional presidents vote on monetary policy on a\nrotating basis, represent their districts at meetings of the\n Federal Open Market Committee  and play a front-line role in\ntasks such as circulating currency and maintaining the U.S.\npayments system.  \u2018Media Interest\u2019  When filing internal reports on their assets, regional bank\npresidents aren\u2019t required to list their personal residences or\nstakes in employee benefit plans.  The asset values listed by the officials for 2010 vary\nwidely. While St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  had no\nholdings that required disclosure, New York\u2019s William C. Dudley\nheld assets in excess of $9.5 million and  Richard Fisher  of\n Dallas  listed holdings exceeding $20 million.  Fisher\u2019s financial report showed millions of dollars in\nmunicipal bonds and 7,113 acres of land in states including\nIowa, Missouri and Texas.  The Government Accountability Office last year said that\nthe Fed needed to strengthen its conflict of interest policies,\nciting Dudley\u2019s receipt of a waiver in 2008 to keep his personal\nholdings in  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  after the insurer\nwas rescued by the central bank. The GAO said in a July report\nthat the example \u201chighlights the potential for appearance\nconcerns,\u201d even if the stake was a small percentage of the\nperson\u2019s total holdings.  AIG Stock  Dudley, who was the New York Fed\u2019s markets-group chief when\nhe received the waiver, owned $1,200 of AIG stock in September\n2008, according to waiver forms released yesterday. He hadn\u2019t\nbeen required to sell the shares under the central bank\u2019s code\nof conduct because the insurer wasn\u2019t supervised by the Fed.  After the central bank invoked its emergency-lending powers\nto rescue AIG in 2008, Dudley said in a September interview with\nBloomberg News that he brought the fact that he owned the shares\nto the central bank\u2019s attention.  \u201cI basically identified that I had the holdings and said,\n\u2018I will do whatever you want me to do,\u2019\u201d said Dudley, who\nworked on the $85 billion loan to the insurer.  Then New York-Fed President  Timothy F. Geithner  directed\nhim to keep the AIG shares until a later, predetermined date\nbecause selling them at that time would also pose a conflict\nsince he had access to inside information about the company\u2019s\ndire state, the GAO said. Dudley has since sold the shares as\ndirected by the bank.  GE Shares  The New York Fed chief had to seek approval to own $106,830\nof General Electric Co. stock in 2008. Fairfield, Connecticut-\nbased GE accessed a Fed emergency program for commercial paper.\nThe waiver for the GE stock was also disclosed last year by the\nGAO, though not the value.  Dudley also received a waiver to own Treasury Inflation\nProtected Securities because Fed officials \u201cwho participate in\ninterest rate decisions\u201d must get approval to own interest-rate\nsensitive government securities, the  New York  Fed said in a\nstatement yesterday. Dudley bought the TIPS before he joined the\nFed and agreed to hold the securities until their maturity,\naccording to the New York Fed.  The New York Fed\u2019s website says that \u201cannual financial\ndisclosures and related documents for the New York Fed\nPresident, beginning in 2008, are available upon request.\u201d  Lockhart Reports  Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  disclosed a series of\nirregularities in reports from 2007 to 2009, when managers of\ninvestment funds that he didn\u2019t directly control traded in bank\nand bank holding-company shares. Lockhart inadvertently held\nbank stocks in 2008 and traded during a \u201cblackout period\u201d\nafter independent managers working for him ignored his\ninstructions, Lockhart said in a memo in May 2009.  Merrill Lynch\u2019s private banking group in  Chicago  made the\ntrades in banks, Lockhart said. The group traded in numerous\nstocks and acted in ways similar to a mutual fund, he said. Fed\npolicy forbids ownership of shares in banks that it regulates.  \u201cIt is not an excuse, but the fact is I did not monitor\nthe trading activity of these accounts during 2008 and was\nunaware of the prohibited trades. I relied on Merrill Lynch,\u201d\nand in 2009 switched to another manager to increase control, he\nsaid.  A review by the ethics officer for the Atlanta Fed,\nconsulting with the board of governors, concluded Lockhart had\nnot violated federal ethics laws and that his \u201cremedial steps\nwere appropriate.\u201d  Lockhart\u2019s stock holdings in 2008 included U.S. Bancorp,\n Wells Fargo & Co .,  Bank of America Corp . and Citigroup.  Code of Conduct  The Fed Board\u2019s code of conduct for the regional banks bars\nconflicts of interest through gifts, investments and outside\nactivities such as other employment. Employees must \u201cavoid\naction that might result or create the appearance of using a\nposition for private gain, giving preferential treatment or\nlosing independence,\u201d according to the code.  In addition, the code prohibits \u201cownership of debt or\nequity interests of a depository institution, a primary\ngovernment securities dealer or their affiliates.\u201d The 12 banks\nset their own codes of conduct.  During the financial crisis, the regional banks helped\nimplement the emergency lending programs that peaked at $1.2\ntrillion on Dec. 5, 2008.  Chicago Fed President  Charles Evans  sold most of his stock\nduring the first full week of February 2008.  In 2007, Evans owned 11 stocks that included International\nBusiness Machines Corp., Duke Energy Corp., and drugmaker Wyeth,\nnow owned by Pfizer Inc., valued at a total of between $11,011\nand $551,001.  Holdings Sold  In February 2008, Evans sold all of his holdings in nine of\nthe stocks and kept two, then each valued at less than $1,000.\nBy 2010, he had moved most of his holdings into mutual funds and\ncertificates of deposit.  The bank presidents are responsible for supervising state\nmember banks and bank holding companies. At the end of 2010,\nsuch oversight encompassed 5,464 U.S. bank-holding companies\ncontrolling 5,443 commercial banks with approximately 99 percent\nof all insured commercial bank assets in the U.S., according to\nthe Fed\u2019s annual report released in June.  -- With assistance from Caroline Salas in New York,\n Steve Matthews  in Atlanta, and Vivien Lou Chen and Aki Ito in\n San Francisco .
