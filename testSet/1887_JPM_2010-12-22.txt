 "context": "The following article called 'Banks Dumping JGBs as Only Peripheral Europe Bonds Do Worse: Japan Credit' was published on 2010-12-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJapan\u2019s banks, which bought record\namounts of government debt as demand for loans dropped, are\nselling the bonds for the first time this year as prices tumble.  Lenders trimmed Japanese government debt holdings to 142.2\ntrillion yen ($1.7 trillion) as of Oct. 31 from a record 143.2\ntrillion yen a month earlier, Bank of Japan data show. They\nadded bonds in each of the previous nine months as  loans\noutstanding  fell 2.1 percent to 391.9 trillion yen, the lowest\nsince May 2008. Government bonds lost 1.5 percent since Sept. 30,\nset for the worst quarter in seven years, indexes compiled by\nBank of America Merrill Lynch show.  \u201cBanks may make some changes to their strategies as\ndeclining bond prices trim trading profits,\u201d said  Yoshinobu Yamada , a Tokyo-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. Lending will\nextend its longest slump since 2005 as \u201cthe economic outlook is\nweak, companies are building reserves and avoiding capital\nspending, and manufacturing is hollowing out and moving\nabroad,\u201d he said.  The double whammy means earnings at Japan\u2019s biggest banks\n Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. , Mizuho Financial Group Inc.\nand Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. will drop at least 4.3\npercent, while profit will rise at U.S. rivals including\n JPMorgan Chase & Co.  and Citigroup Inc., according to analysts\nsurveyed by Bloomberg. Japan\u2019s government bonds are performing\nworse this year than all but the European countries swept up in\nthe sovereign debt crisis, among developed nations.  Shinya Matsumoto, a spokesman for Mitsubishi UFJ, said the\nbank regularly monitors all risk assets, declining to give\ndetails of transactions.  Kyosuke Hattori , a spokesman for the\nbanking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui, declined to comment, as did\n Masako Shiono , a spokeswoman for Mizuho. The companies are all\nbased in Tokyo.  Bond Sales  The biggest banks in the world\u2019s second-largest economy sold\na net 3 trillion yen of Japanese government bonds in November,\nexcluding short-term securities, the Japan Securities Dealers\nAssociation reported on its website.  Investors in Japanese government bonds earned 3.3 percent\nin the first nine months of 2010, according to the Merrill\nindexes. The securities have since pared this year\u2019s gain to 1.8\npercent as of Dec. 20, ahead of only Ireland, Portugal, Spain\nand Italy among 20 developed nations tracked by the indexes. U.S.\nTreasuries returned 5.6 percent. Denmark\u2019s debt climbed 8.4\npercent to offer the largest profit.  Shrinking Lending  \u201cBanks may have sold more debt in November as part of a\nstrategy to lock in decent profits out of bond sales and to\ncounter sluggish lending demand,\u201d said  Takehito Yamanaka , a\nTokyo-based analyst at MF Global FXA Securities Ltd. \u201cSome\nmight have started offering loans to companies with narrower\nlending margins to capture the largest pie in a shrinking\nmarket.\u201d  The  yield  on Japan\u2019s 10-year bonds jumped 22 basis points\nthis quarter, the biggest increase since the second quarter of\n2008. Ten-year yields, which declined 1 basis point to 1.15\npercent as of 11:45 a.m. in Tokyo, will advance to 1.25 percent\nby the end of 2011, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Rising yields on Japanese government bonds and U.S.\nTreasuries may have an impact on banks\u2019 earnings in the second\nhalf of the year ending March 31,  Masayuki Oku , head of the\nJapanese Bankers Association, told reporters in Tokyo yesterday.\nOku, who is also chairman of Sumitomo Mitsui, added that yields\nare unlikely to \u201cchange drastically.\u201d  Bank lending  fell for a 12th month in November, extending\nthe worst streak since 2005, central bank figures show.\nCorporate  demand for loans  has slid for six quarters as\nbusinesses pare investments, according to a Bank of Japan survey\nof loan officers.  Spending Cuts  Loans outstanding at the 83 lenders in the Topix Banks\nIndex declined 2.5 percent to 5.44 trillion yen on average in\nthe year to Sept. 30. Capital spending for the 1,664 companies\nin the Topix Index shrank in the final three months of 2010,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Borrowing dwindled even after the Bank of Japan cut\ninterest rates to virtually zero and started three credit\nprograms totaling about 40 trillion yen to support the economy.\n Gross domestic product  is likely to shrink this quarter for the\nfirst time in more than a year because of a stronger yen and\ndeflation, according to a survey of 42 economists released Dec.\n8 by the government-affiliated Economic Planning Association.  \u201cThe biggest challenge facing Japanese lenders now is how\nto improve their profitability,\u201d central bank Deputy Governor\n Hirohide Yamaguchi  said at a forum in Tokyo on Dec. 10.  Smaller Earnings  Profit at  Mitsubishi UFJ , the country\u2019s largest bank, will\ndecline 4.3 percent to 509 billion yen in the year starting\nApril 1 from a projected 532 billion yen this fiscal year,\naccording to the median estimate of six analysts surveyed by\nBloomberg News over the past month. Sumitomo Mitsui\u2019s net income\nwill drop 24 percent to 410 billion yen and  Mizuho \u2019s will slip\n26 percent to 368 billion yen, the estimates showed.  Mitsubishi UFJ\u2019s two main banking units reported an average\nlending margin of 1.43 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30,\nthe lowest since March 2007. Interest rates on deposits stood at\n0.13 percent, also the smallest since March 2007.  The cost to protect banks\u2019 debt against default is rising\nthis quarter even as prices decline on average for contracts\ncovering the rest of the nation\u2019s investment-grade borrowers.  Credit default swaps covering Mitsubishi UFJ\u2019s subordinated\nbonds for five years climbed to 103 basis points yesterday, the\nmost for almost five months, from 97 on Sept. 30, CMA prices\nshow. Swaps on the subordinated debt of Mizuho Corporate Bank\nLtd., a Mizuho unit, rose to 120 from 113.  Wall Street Profit  The Markit iTraxx Japan index of credit-default swaps on 50\ninvestment-grade borrowers declined four basis points this\nquarter to 102. The contracts pay the buyer face value in\nexchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent\nshould a government or company fail to meet its obligations.  Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks are poised to report their\nsecond-highest earnings ever this year, according to Bloomberg\nsurveys of analysts. JPMorgan\u2019s profit will climb 15 percent to\n$19 billion in 2011 and Citigroup  earnings  are projected to gain\n26 percent to $14.6 billion, the surveys show.  Credit Suisse Group AG analyst  Shinichi Ina  downgraded\n Mizuho  and Mitsubishi UFJ to \u201cneutral\u201d on Nov. 29, citing\nworsening bond-trading profits. Tokyo-based Ina kept Sumitomo\nMitsui at \u201coutperform,\u201d estimating a higher return on equity\nthan its peers next fiscal year.  Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and  Sumitomo Mitsui  all raised their\nfull-year profit forecasts in November, as trading gains and\nlower bad-loan costs in the first half made up for declining net\ninterest income.  Banks Underperform  The  Topix Banks Index  has slid 2 percent this year,\ncompared with a 0.1 percent increase in the benchmark  Topix .\nMitsubishi UFJ rose 1.4 percent at the 11 a.m. break in Tokyo,\nparing this year\u2019s loss to 1.8 percent. Mizuho gained 2.7\npercent, trimming its decline for 2010 to 6.6 percent. Sumitomo\nMitsui added 1 percent, extending its gain to 11 percent.  In the U.S., the  KBW Bank Index  rose 20 percent this year,\noutpacing a 13 percent gain for Standard & Poor\u2019s 500. Citigroup\nhas climbed 43 percent, while JPMorgan fell 1.6 percent.  The BOJ, which held  interest rates  at between zero and 0.1\npercent yesterday, has said it will keep them unchanged until\ninflation reaches 1 percent.  Consumer prices  excluding fresh\nfood fell 0.6 percent in October from a year earlier.  Investors maintained bets the central bank won\u2019t end the\ndecade-long deflation that the government says is curbing\neconomic growth. The difference between yields on five-year\nJapanese government notes and inflation-linked debt, a gauge of\ntrader expectations for consumer prices, was minus 0.65\npercentage point today. The five-year average is minus 1.11\npercentage points.  The yen gained 11 percent against the dollar this year,\nreaching a 15-year high of 80.22 per dollar on Nov. 1. The\ncurrency traded at 83.81 as of 12:02 p.m. in Tokyo.
