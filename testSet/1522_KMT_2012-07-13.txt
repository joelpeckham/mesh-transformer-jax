 "context": "The following article called 'Wholesale Prices in U.S. Rise for First Time in Four Months' was published on 2012-07-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWholesale prices in the U.S.\nunexpectedly rose in June for the first time in four months,\nreflecting an increase in food costs.  The 0.1 percent gain in the producer price  index  followed a\n1 percent decrease the prior month, Labor Department figures\nshowed today in Washington. The  median  estimate in a Bloomberg\nNews survey of 70 economists called for a 0.4 percent fall.\nExcluding volatile food and energy, the so-called  core  measure\nincreased 0.2 percent as projected.  A. Schulman Inc. and  Kennametal Inc. (KMT)  are among companies\nanticipating  raw materials  costs will remain restrained as\nmarkets from  Europe  to  Asia  cool. Weakening growth in the U.S.\nalso may limit price pressures through the production pipeline,\nreinforcing Federal Reserve policy makers\u2019 projections that\ninflation is likely to be subdued.  \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about inflation at all at this point,\u201d\nsaid  Michael Moran , chief economist at Daiwa Capital Markets\nAmerica Inc. in  New York , who correctly forecast the gain in\nprices. \u201cSome decline in commodity prices and a slower rate of\ngrowth in both the U.S. and globally suggests restrained prices\nin coming months.\u201d  Stock-index futures held earlier gains after the report as\nslowing growth in  China  fueled speculation policy makers will\nboost stimulus measures. The contract on the Standard & Poor\u2019s\n500 Index maturing in September climbed 0.3 percent to 1,333 at\n8:44 a.m. in New York.  Treasury securities  were little changed,\nwith the yield on the benchmark 10-year note at 1.49 percent\ncompared with 1.48 percent late yesterday.  Survey Results  Economists\u2019 estimate for producer prices ranged from an\nincrease of 0.2 percent to a decline of 1.3 percent.  Compared with the same month a year earlier, companies paid\n0.7 percent more for goods, matching the 12-month gain in May as\nthe smallest since October 2009.  The core index increased 2.6 percent in the 12 months ended\nin June, the smallest year-to-year gain since June 2011.  The gains in the PPI were led by a 0.5 percent increase in\nfood, reflecting the biggest increase in meat prices since July\n2011, the report showed.  Energy costs dropped 0.9 percent from the prior month,\nwhich included a record 2.1 percent drop in residential\nelectricity.  About 70 percent of the increase in the core measure was\nattributed to a 1.4 percent advance in the cost of light motor\ntrucks, the biggest in a year.  Raw Materials  Expenses further down assembly lines continued to drop last\nmonth, indicating price pressures will remain restrained. The\ncost of intermediate goods decreased 0.5 percent, the third\nconsecutive decline. Crude goods fell 3.6 percent, the fourth\nstraight fall.  Akron, Ohio-based  A. Schulman (SHLM) , a supplier of plastic\ncompounds, anticipates raw-material costs will be relatively\nunchanged and said companies from which it buys goods seem to\nhave little pricing power.  \u201cEvery month somebody tells us they\u2019re going to increase\ntheir price,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Joseph Gingo said on a\nJuly 10 conference call with analysts. \u201cAnd every month,\nthey\u2019re not able to push it through because there is no demand,\nor soft demand.\u201d  Producers benefiting from retreating costs for oil and\nother materials include Kennametal, a Latrobe, Pennsylvania-\nbased supplier of cutting tools to manufacturers. The lower\nexpenses will be a \u201ctailwind,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Carlos Cardoso said on a June 6 conference call with analysts.  Fed Outlook  Contained price pressures give the Fed more room to try to\nspur the three-year expansion. Declining consumer inflation\nreflected reductions in the price of crude oil and gasoline, and\n\u201cmeasures of long-run inflation expectations continued to be\nstable,\u201d policy makers said in minutes of their June meeting\nreleased this week.  Producer prices are one of three monthly inflation gauges\nreported by the Labor Department. The import-price index fell\n2.7 percent in June, the biggest plunge since December 2008, a\nreport showed yesterday. Prices excluding fuel fell 0.3 percent,\nthe most in almost two years.  The cost of living index, the broadest of the three\nmeasures, may have been little changed last month, economists\npredicted ahead of the July 17 data.
