The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. equities pared early gains as a\nsurge in oil dragged down transportation and consumer shares\nwhile Greece\u2019s approval for a second bailout failed to spur\nenough confidence to keep the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index at an\nalmost four-year high. Treasuries declined.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent to 1,362.21 at 4 p.m. in New\nYork after earlier climbing as much as 0.5 percent to top its\nhighest closing level since June 2008. The  Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage  trimmed its advance after climbing above 13,000 for the\nfirst time since May 2008. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.5\npercent. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield jumped six basis points\nto 2.06 percent. Oil reached a nine-month high near $106 a\nbarrel as  Iran  said it stopped selling to  France  and Britain.  European finance ministers approved 130 billion euros ($173\nbillion) in aid for Greece by tapping into European Central Bank\nprofits and coaxing investors into providing more debt relief to\nshield the region from a default. The early rally in U.S.\nequities was also triggered by better- than-estimated earnings\nat companies from Home Depot Inc. to Macy\u2019s Inc.  \u201cWhen you reach a headline level, there\u2019s always some\nfall-back in the short-term,\u201d Madelynn Matlock, who helps\noversee about $14.5 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in\nCincinnati, said in a telephone interview. \u201cHaving a deal in\n Greece  means that at least in March we don\u2019t have the prospect\nof a disorderly default facing us. Obviously, this doesn\u2019t solve\nany long-term problems. On top of that, in a climate where\nnobody in the developed world has wonderful growth, the last\nthing you need is higher  oil prices .\u201d  Energy, Airline Shares  Energy companies in the S&P 500 rallied 0.8 percent as a\ngroup, paced by gains of more than 1 percent in Exxon Mobil\nCorp. and Chevron Corp.

(AA) \nrose 2.6 percent for the biggest gain in the Dow, which closed\n15.82 points higher at 12,965.69 after climbing as high as\n13,005.04.  European Stocks  About three shares fell for each that advanced in the  Stoxx\n600 (SXXP) . Segro Plc, the U.K.\u2019s largest publicly traded owner of\nindustrial properties, sank 2.1 percent after saying net asset\nvalue declined 9.8 percent. Real-estate companies fell 1.5\npercent as a group for the biggest drop among 19 industries.  Europe  is still struggling to avoid the threat of default\nas investors warned Greece will soon risk violating the terms of\nits second bailout in three years. The nation signed up to a\nprogram of austerity and economic reform aimed at slashing debt\nto 120.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from about\n160 percent last year.  Economists from Citigroup Inc. to Commerzbank AG concluded\nGreece may again fail to deliver on austerity goals amid a fifth\nyear of recession, looming elections and social unrest.  \u201cThe Greek bailout keeps the wheels on the bus,\u201d James Dunigan, who helps oversee $107 billion as chief investment\nofficer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said in a\nphone interview. \u201cThe ride is a little smoother, but it doesn\u2019t\nsolve the longer-term issues.\u201d  Treasury Auction  The two-year Treasury yield increased less than one basis\npoint to 0.303 percent following an auction of $35 billion of\nthe notes. The notes yielded 0.310 percent, matching 0.310\npercent in pre-auction treading and compared with 0.25 percent\nat the previous sale on Jan. 24. The Treasury auction drew a\nbid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids\nwith the amount of securities offered, of 3.54 compared with an\naverage of the past 10 auctions of 3.49 percent.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against\nthose of six trading partners, fell 0.3 percent. The Australian\ndollar weakened against all 16 of its major counterparts, losing\n0.8 percent versus the U.S. currency, after minutes of the\nnation\u2019s most-recent central bank policy meeting showed there is\nscope for monetary easing.
