The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDNO International ASA  said a\nbreakthrough in talks to form a government in Iraq will be an\n\u201cimportant milestone\u201d in paving the way for the resumption of\noil exports from the Kurdish region.  \u201cGetting a government in place is a necessary step for\nthis process to move on,\u201d Chief Executive Officer  Helge Eide \nsaid in an interview in Oslo today. \u201cIf this happens, it\u2019s a\nvery positive development, and we hope things can now be\nresolved.\u201d  Legislators in Baghdad reached an agreement on a government\nlast night after eight months of deadlock. The new coalition\nwill have to resolve a dispute over the passage of a law\ngoverning the use of Iraq\u2019s oil and gas reserves. The semi-\nautonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq suspended oil exports\nlast year following a row over payments to foreign companies,\nincluding Oslo-based DNO.  \u201cIf we\u2019re able to get a viable government in place I\nbelieve everyone, including the Kurds, will have the issues that\nare important to them heard,\u201d Eide said. \u201cAnd we know what\nposition they\u2019ve taken with regards to oil exports.\u201d  DNO\u2019s chief executive said negotiations between the Kurdish\nRegional Government, or KRG, and Iraq\u2019s central authorities on\noil exports meant a foundation was in place for an agreement\nthat would enable exports to resume more rapidly.  \u201cWe can assume that there have been a lot of discussions\naround this and perhaps some agreements have been reached, but\nthis can\u2019t be implemented until we have a government,\u201d Eide\nsaid.  Shipments Halted  \u201cThe Kurds have likely secured a deal regarding\nconcessions on the oil law and approving the Kurdish oil\ncontract in return for their support of\u201d Iraqi Prime Minister\n Nuri al-Maliki ,  Trond Omdal , an analyst at Arctic Securities\nASA, said in a note. \u201cWe therefore regard a new Maliki-\ngovernment supported by the Kurds as positive for DNO.\u201d  DNO has pumped oil in the Kurdish region since 2007 and in\nJune 2009 started exports through Turkey until shipments halted\nin September of that year.  The company had been delivering about 45,000 barrels a day\nthrough a pipeline to Ceyhan in Turkey. Eide said DNO could\nbring production at its Tawke field up to full capacity \u201cquite\nquickly\u201d once the company received permission to resume\nexports. DNO recently reached capacity of 56,000 barrels a day\nin production at Tawke\u2019s central processing facilities, Eide\nsaid today.  Quarterly Loss  Earlier today, DNO  reported  a third-quarter net loss of 146\nmillion kroner ($25 million), down from a restated loss of 138\nmillion kroner a year prior. The company in February restated\nsales for last year after an estimated $133 million in Iraqi\nrevenue failed to materialize.  The stock fell 0.275 krone, or 2 percent, to 8.830 kroner\nas of 4:03 p.m. in Oslo, capping this year\u2019s advance at 74\npercent.  The company\u2019s earnings were affected by a provision of 322\nmillion kroner related to claims and legal costs in connection\nwith a case at the London Court of International Arbitration\nagainst undisclosed parties that had held stakes in its assets.\nDNO is disputing the terms and conditions of the award ruled by\nthe court, Eide said at a press conference today.  Sales rose 73 percent to 407 million kroner, buoyed by a 79\npercent increase in net entitlement production to 16,161 barrels\nof oil equivalents a day. DNO\u2019s realized oil price slipped 8.5\npercent to $44.99 per barrel due to an increased shared of its\nproduction being delivered to the local market in Kurdistan,\nwhere it is sold at a discounted price.
