Announces Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results; Net Investment Income of $0.60 Per Share; Board Declares Second Quarter 2018 Distribution of $0.25 Per Share ($0.083 Per Share Per Month)' was published on 2018-03-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWALTHAM, Mass., March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Great Elm Capital Corp. (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cour\u201d or \u201cGECC\u201d), (NASDAQ:GECC), today announced its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and filed its annual report on Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nNet investment income (\u201cNII\u201d) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $6.4 million, or $0.60 (1) per share, which was in excess of our declared monthly base distribution of $0.083 per share (or approximately $0.25 per share for the quarter) for the same period, which equated to a 2.4x base distribution coverage or 1.3x coverage when including the special distribution. Net investment income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $17.6 million, or $1.52 per share, which equated to a 1.5x base distribution coverage or 1.2x coverage when including the special distribution. In March, the Board of Directors declared monthly distributions of $0.083 per share for the second quarter of 2018, representing a yield of approximately 8.02% of December 31, 2017 NAV. Net assets on December 31, 2017 were approximately $132.3 million. Net asset value (\u201cNAV\u201d) per share on December 31, 2017 was $12.42, as compared to $12.38 per share on September 30, 2017. We had approximately $213 thousand of net realized gains on portfolio investments that were monetized during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, or approximately $0.02 per share, and net unrealized depreciation of investments of approximately ($1.6) million, or approximately ($0.16) per share. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we purchased an aggregate of 77,430 shares through our stock buy-back program at an average price of $10.24, utilizing approximately $792.5 thousand of our $15.0 million 10b5-1 program and our overall $50 million stock repurchase program. From the commencement of the stock buyback program through March 8, 2018, including the tender offer, we have purchased an aggregate of 2,236,651 shares at a weighted average price of $11.18 per share, resulting in approximately $25 million of cumulative cash paid to purchase shares and $0.43 per share in accretion to our NAV. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we invested approximately $46.1 million across 11 portfolio companies (2) , including four new portfolio investments. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we monetized approximately $39.7 million across 16 portfolio companies (in part or in full). (3)\n\u201cAs we reflect on our first full year in managing GECC, we are proud to highlight some significant accomplishments: the successful monetization of a number of legacy Full Circle investments; out-earning our regular monthly distribution each quarter of 2017, which we supplemented with a special distribution in Q4 to bring our annual distribution yield to 9.63% of our December 31st NAV; and the on-going thoughtful deployment of capital into a number of attractive risk-adjusted opportunities,\u201d said Peter A. Reed, GECC\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThrough these actions, we continue to demonstrate our intense focus on creating long-term shareholder value.\u201d\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of December 31, 2017, we held 24 debt investments across 19 companies, totaling approximately $164.5 million and representing 99.8% of invested capital. First lien and / or senior secured debt investments comprised 99.8% of invested capital as of the same date.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average current yield on our debt portfolio was approximately 15.3% with approximately 48.1% of invested debt capital in floating rate instruments.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we deployed approximately $46.1 million (2) into new and existing investments across 11 companies (four new investments, seven additional investments). The weighted average price of the new debt investments was 97% of par, carrying a weighted average current yield of 11.4%. All of these investments are first lien and / or senior secured investments.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we monetized 16 investments, in part or in full, for approximately $39.7 million (3) , at a weighted average current yield of 10.4%. Our weighted average realization price was par.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $9.7 million, or $0.92 per share. Net expenses for the period ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $3.3 million, or $0.32 per share.\nNet realized gains for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $213 thousand, or $0.02 per share. Net unrealized depreciation from investments for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was approximately ($1.6) million, or ($0.16) per share.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2017, available liquidity from cash and money market investments was approximately $18.9 million, exclusive of our holdings of United States Treasury Bills.\nTotal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2017 was $32.6 million. Pro forma for the issuance of the GECCM notes in January and February 2018, total debt outstanding as of March 2018 was approximately $79.0 million, comprised of the 6.50% notes due September 2022 (NASDAQ:GECCL) and the 6.75% notes due January 2025 (NASDAQ:GECCM).\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDistributions:\nOur board of directors declared the monthly distributions for the second fiscal quarter of 2018 at $0.083 per share. The schedule of distribution payments is as follows:\nMonth Rate Record Date Payable Date April $0.083 April 30, 2018 May 15, 2018 May $0.083 May 31, 2018 June 15, 2018 June $0.083 June 29, 2018 July 16, 2018 Our distribution policy has been designed to set a base distribution rate that is well-covered by NII. From time to time, as catalyst-driven investments are realized or when we out-earn our declared distributions, we intend to supplement monthly distributions with special distributions from NII generated in excess of the declared distributions, such as the $0.20 per share special distribution that was declared in December 2017 and paid in January 2018.
