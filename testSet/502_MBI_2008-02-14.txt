 "context": "The following article called 'New York's Dinallo Considers Splitting Bond Insurers' was published on 2008-02-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBond insurers may be split into two\nbusinesses in what would be the biggest overhaul of the industry\nsince it was created almost four decades ago.  \n New York Insurance Department Superintendent Eric Dinallo\nsaid such a separation is one of the proposals regulators have\nbeen discussing with bond insurers, including  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  and  Ambac\nFinancial Group Inc. (ABKFQ)   \n ``One would have the municipal bond policies and any other\nhealthy parts of the business,'' Dinallo said in prepared\ntestimony for a hearing today of the House Financial Services\nsubcommittee on  capital markets  in  Washington . ``The other would\nhave the structured finance and problem parts of the business.''  \n New York Governor  Eliot Spitzer  told the committee that the\nstep, while ``not optimal,'' may be necessary if the companies\ncan't raise the capital needed to stave off credit-rating\ndowngrades. The world's largest bond insurers may lose the AAA\nratings they use to guarantee $2.4 trillion of municipal and\nmortgage-backed debt, casting doubt on the rankings of thousands\nof schools, hospitals and local governments around the country.  \n Dinallo said his main goal is to protect the municipal\nborrowers and debt holders. Executives of Armonk, New York-based\nMBIA and Ambac are also scheduled to appear before the committee\nand will say they can survive the slump in mortgage securities.  \n Recapitalization  \n The best option is to recapitalize the bond insurers and\nstabilize the companies without dividing them, Spitzer told\nreporters after his testimony. ``That could happen within a\ncouple of days,'' he said.  \n Dinallo last month organized banks to begin plans for a\nrescue of the insurers and said he may consider tightening\nrestrictions on what bond insurers can guarantee.  \n Splitting the companies in two was proposed by billionaire\ninvestor  Warren Buffett , who this week said he offered to take\nover $800 billion of the municipal debt guaranteed by MBIA, Ambac\nand FGIC Corp., the fourth-largest bond insurer. The plan would\nleave behind the guarantees on mortgage-backed securities and\nother corporate debt responsible for the companies' losses.  \n Spitzer told the committee that such a ``good bank, bad bank\nstructure,'' may be necessary if other rescue plans fail. Federal\nregulation may also be needed, he said.  \n ``I am not opposed to federal regulation but how and when it\nis done needs to be thought through,'' Spitzer said in an\ninterview with Bloomberg Television.  \n Insurers are supervised by states rather than the federal\ngovernment, with New York often taking a lead role. New York\nregulates bond insurers under Article 69 of the state insurance\nlaw, Spitzer said in his testimony, calling the statute ``the\nstandard for state insurance departments around the country.''  \n Policy Options  \n U.S. lawmakers at the hearing today criticized the practices\nof the bond-insurance industry, saying they turned good debt bad\nand need to be put under the supervision of a federal regulator.  \n The expansion by the industry beyond their traditional\nmunicipal-bond businesses to guaranteeing debt linked to riskier\nsubprime mortgages and home-equity loans, ``has had disastrous\nconsequences,''  Spencer Bachus  of  Alabama , the top Republican on\nthe House Financial Services Committee, said.  \n Representative Paul Kanjorski of  Pennsylvania , who is\npresiding over the hearing today, proposed enacting a law that\nwould allow the  Federal Home Loan Banks  ``to enhance municipal\nbonds with letters of credit like  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac \nalready do.''  \n Spitzer said that would be a ``very worthy idea.''  \n ``Other policy options include imposing new requirements for\n credit rating agencies  and addressing the differences between\nratings on structured finance products, corporate debt and\nmunicipal bonds,'' Kanjorski said.  \n Approaching Buffett  \n Dinallo said he approached Buffett to value the municipal\nbond portfolio of the three largest insurers.  \n ``There may be other investors who would be interested in\ninvesting in the municipal side of the business,'' Dinallo said\nin his testimony.  \n MBIA and New York-based Ambac, the two largest bond insurers\nare reeling from their expansion beyond guaranteeing municipal\ndebt to collateralized debt obligations, which repackage assets\nsuch as mortgage bonds and buyout loans into new securities with\nvarying risk. As the value of some CDOs plummets, ratings\ncompanies are pressing insurers to add more capital.  \n MBIA  rose  98 cents to $12.62 today in  New York  Stock\nExchange composite trading. Ambac  climbed  $1.16 to $10.53. MBIA\nand Ambac tumbled more than 80 percent in the past year as they\nposted record  losses  of more than $5 billion and concern grew the\ncompanies may not get enough capital to sustain their ratings.  \n No Bailout Needed  \n MBIA Chief Financial Officer Charles Chaplin dismissed\nsuggestions that the industry needs a rescue or stronger federal\noversight, according to his prepared remarks.  \n ``A bailout of highly credit-worthy companies who, at most,\nare at risk of losing the very highest ratings available, is\nmisplaced,'' Chaplin said.  \n MBIA has raised $2.6 billion through investors and an\nadditional $500 million in capital has been generated as existing\npolicies have run off and through gains in the investment\nportfolio, Chaplin said in an interview ahead of his scheduled\ntestimony before the hearing.  \n ``That gives us a cushion of more than a $1 billion to each\nof the rating agency's stated requirements,'' Chaplin said. ``No\nreasonable person would say MBIA won't be able to pay claims.''  \n Chaplin and Ambac Chief Executive Officer Michael Callen are\ntrying to fend off critics who say the companies may be headed\nfor bankruptcy. One of the most vocal skeptics, hedge fund\nmanager  William Ackman , will also deliver remarks today.  \n Municipal Focus  \n Spitzer told the committee that the economy may face a\n``financial tsunami'' as a result of potential downgrades to bond\ninsurers and a tightening of credit markets that resulted from\nbad loans to homebuyers.  \n Federal regulators blocked earlier efforts to tighten rules,\nand the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allowed ``the\nproblem to grow and the bubble to inflate,'' Spitzer said.  \n Spitzer and Dinallo both said their focus is on the\nmunicipal market rather than banks and financial institutions\nthat sought insurance on structured-finance securities.  \n ``We cannot allow the millions of individual Americans who\ninvested in what was a low-risk investment lose money because of\nsubprime excesses,'' Dinallo said. ``Nor should subprime problems\ncause taxpayers to unnecessarily pay more to borrow for essential\ncapital projects.''  \n Demand for AAA rated securities still exceeds the supply and\nNew York has invited new companies to provide bond insurance,\nDinallo said.  \n ``It has become clear that the loss of the AAA rating\nessentially cripples the company's ability to do business as a\ngoing concern,'' Dinallo's testimony said.  \n FGIC Corp., the bond insurer owned by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) \nand PMI Group Inc., lost its Aaa insurance rating at Moody's\nInvestors Service today after failing to raise enough capital to\ncompensate for losses on subprime-mortgage guarantees.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nChristine Richard in Washington at \n crichard5@bloomberg.net ;\nJames Tyson in Washington at \n jtyson@bloomberg.net   \n To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nEmma Moody at \n emoody@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Eric R.
