 "context": "The following article called 'Sandy Cost Spurs N.J. Shore Borrowing at \u201960s Yield: Muni Credit' was published on 2012-11-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrick Township, on the New  Jersey Shore , estimates its costs to clean up from  Hurricane Sandy  equal more than half its $87 million annual budget.  The town of about 75,000 authorized $18 million in short- term borrowing to help pay bills as it awaits federal aid. Its southern neighbor, Toms River, approved a $35 million emergency appropriation Nov. 16 to cover Sandy-related costs after the storm damaged about 30 percent of its tax base.  The biggest Atlantic storm in history cost New Jersey an estimated $36.9 billion after sweeping ashore Oct. 29, killing 38 people in the state and blacking out 2.7 million. While states and localities expect the federal government to reimburse at least 75 percent of their response and cleanup expenses, some towns are borrowing to cover bills before those payments arrive.  \u201cEvery municipality in this area is going to be hitting the market for temporary financing,\u201d Paul Shives, Toms River\u2019s administrator, said at a Nov. 26 hearing.  Cities and towns tapping investors stand to benefit from the lowest municipal  interest rates  since 1965, according to Bond Buyer  data . The $3.7 trillion market rallied the past four weeks on bets taxes will rise to help trim the federal deficit.  Municipalities affected by the storm could temporarily have less cash or more debt after dealing with power outages, fires, water damage and debris removal, Moody\u2019s Investors Service said in a Nov. 13 report.  Costs Recouped  Such expenses \u201cdo not fundamentally threaten long-term  credit quality \u201d because issuers will recoup most of those costs, the company said.  Still, a limited number of issuers have been \u201cso heavily impacted by Sandy that their ratings could be affected,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.  New Jersey  towns cited include Brick,  Atlantic City  and Seaside Heights along the shore and Woodbridge, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from  Manhattan .  Atlantic City, which had to evacuate some of its 40,000 residents and shut seaside casinos, will delay projects such as road-paving and pay for repairs from a capital fund rather than short-term borrowing, said Michael Stinson, the finance director.  The municipality will get a sense of investor appetite for its debt next week in a sale, planned before Sandy, of about $98 million of bonds to cover property-tax appeals from casinos.  Yield Offer  In preliminary marketing, the city was offering tax-exempt debt maturing in 2022 to yield 2.36 percent, according to three people familiar with the sale. That interest rate is about 0.9 percentage points above a Bloomberg index of AAA munis.  In comparison, investors required 1.28 percentage points of extra yield on 10-year bonds in a January 2011 general- obligation sale, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Atlantic City is rated A- by  Standard & Poor\u2019s , seventh-highest.  Woodbridge Mayor John McCormac, a Democrat and former state treasurer, said the town is pulling cash from its snow-removal account to pay Sandy costs and he doesn\u2019t see a need for borrowing right now.  In Brick, business administrator Scott Pezarras said he doesn\u2019t expect Moody\u2019s to cut the township\u2019s rating of Aa2, the third-highest grade. An estimated 109 to 140 of the community\u2019s homes were destroyed, out of 34,000.  Brick Destruction  \u201cIt\u2019s tragic to the people whose homes that happened to, but it\u2019s not fiscally tragic to the town,\u201d Pezarras said by phone Nov. 19.  Governor  Chris Christie , a first-term Republican, in 2010 placed a 2 percent limit on how much towns can raise property taxes each year, allowing exemptions for natural disasters. The governor on Nov. 13 said that residents may face higher bills as localities seek to cover Sandy costs.  Property-tax caps have strained local finances in places like California and  Massachusetts , said  Peter Hayes , head of muni debt at New York-based  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , which oversees about $105 billion of munis. New Jersey\u2019s exemption for major storms should make the latest issues more sought-after, Hayes said in an interview.  \u201cWaiving that cap would theoretically give them more flexibility, so my guess is that investors would respond favorably to that,\u201d Hayes said.  Crowd Avoidance  Shives, the Toms River administrator, said he is concerned that \u201ceveryone is going to hit that market at the same time.\u201d  He said the township\u2019s bond counsel has also warned him that banks may be concerned about municipalities\u2019 ability to repay the debt and may be reluctant to bring those transactions to market.  \u201cI\u2019m told by our bond counsel that\u2019s something we need to look out for,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may take state legislation to make sure we can have those markets open to us.\u201d  Christie said Nov. 26 that the state has begun working with municipalities to help them access  capital markets . In addition, he said the state is reaching out to banks to solicit their involvement and assistance.  New Jersey postponed its own sale of $2.6 billion of notes after Sandy struck the state. It completed the offering, which helped repay a loan, on Nov. 15 after underwriter JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to buy any unsold debt.  New Jersey municipalities using short-term borrowing include the shore town of Belmar, which plans to issue $20 million of six-to-12-month notes starting next month. About $3 million will cover cleanup and the rest will help rebuild 1.3 miles of boardwalk. Contracts should be in place by year-end, said Mayor Matt Doherty.  Market Move  \u201cBy being aggressive, we\u2019re going to get to the market sooner,\u201d Doherty, a Democrat, said by telephone on Nov. 27.  Little Ferry, about six miles west of Manhattan, was inundated by  storm surge  from the Hackensack River. The council approved $3 million in financing over five years to cover costs, including replacing vehicles and fixing public buildings. It doesn\u2019t expect federal relief by the end of the year, said the borough administrator, Michael Capabianco.  Capabianco estimated the cleanup costs at $2.4 million to $2.7 million, and the borough made bigger borrowing plans as a precaution.  \u201cWe made sure it was high enough to cover everything,\u201d he said by telephone Nov. 19.  Following are pending sales:  NEW JERSEY TRANSPORTATION TRUST FUND AUTHORITY plans to sell $1.25 billion of revenue debt as soon as next week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The bonds are backed by gas-tax revenue the legislature appropriates annually. Proceeds help finance highways, bridges and mass-transit. (Added Nov. 28)  TEXAS is set to offer $939 million in general-obligation bonds, including $100 million of taxable debt, as soon as next week to finance roads, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt will be issued through the Texas Transportation Commission.
