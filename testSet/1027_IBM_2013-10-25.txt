 "context": "The following article called 'CGI Group Seen Rebounding From Obamacare Website Failure' was published on 2013-10-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCGI Group Inc. (GIB/A)  Chief Executive\nOfficer Michael Roach told investors at a conference two weeks\nbefore the debut of the Obamacare website that the contract\nmarked the start of a \u201clong-term relationship\u201d and a\n\u201csignificant growth opportunity.\u201d  Instead,  Canada \u2019s biggest technology company is now a\nvisible face for software snags on the U.S. government site for\nthe 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s made\nCGI known in the U.S. for the wrong reasons, prompting a five-day stock slide and threatening to dent its reputation.  \u201cCGI is the scapegoat,\u201d money manager Brandon Snow of CI\nInvestments Inc.\u2019s Cambridge Advisors unit said in a telephone\ninterview. Cambridge oversees about C$9 billion ($8.64 billion)\nin assets in Toronto and owns shares of Montreal-based CGI.  The Obamacare software breakdowns are a setback for CGI,\nwhich has the  backing  of Caisse de Depot et Placement du  Quebec ,\nthe province\u2019s largest pension-fund manager, and which made more\nthan 20 acquisitions in the last decade to challenge companies\nsuch as  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  Created in 1976 by\nbillionaire founder Serge Godin, CGI is the world\u2019s fifth-largest information technology services company, according to an\nOct. 16 report by  Jason Kupferberg  of Jefferies LLC.  About 8.6 million people visited  www.healthcare.gov  in the\nfirst week, running into long waits that prevented many from\nregistering to check out insurance options. At one point, the\nsite posted error messages in at least 24 states.  \u2018Nobody\u2019s Madder\u2019  \u201cNobody\u2019s madder than me,\u201d U.S. President  Barack Obama \nsaid this week, while Republican critics of the health law\nrenewed their denunciations. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor\nof Virginia called the rollout \u201cnothing short of a debacle.\u201d  That was the political backdrop for a CGI executive\u2019s\ntestimony to Congress yesterday in  Washington  that \u201cend-to-end\ntesting\u201d by a U.S. government agency of all the site\u2019s systems\ndidn\u2019t occur until less than two weeks before the Oct. 1 debut.  \u201cIt would have been better to have more time,\u201d Cheryl Campbell, a senior vice president at CGI Federal, the site\ndesigner, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee. She\ndeclined to say when the site would be free of impediments, and\nsaid it would be ready to meet all deadlines in the health law.  Assessing Blame  Inadequate testing \u201cappears to be the root of the\nproblem,\u201d Thanos Moschopoulos, a BMO Capital Markets analyst in\nToronto who rates CGI as outperform, said yesterday in a note to\nclients. The risk for CGI is \u201cdifficult to assess\u201d and \u201cwill\nultimately depend on what comes out of the hearings, and how\nmuch blame sticks to CGI.\u201d  The hearing was meant to determine whether breakdowns at\nthe Obamacare website were caused by the contractors or \u201cwere\nthey told to do it this way\u201d by the Department of Health and\nHuman Services, Representative Tim Murphy, a Pennsylvania\nRepublican, told reporters Oct. 23 in Washington.  In addition to CGI Federal and the Quality Software\nServices unit of Minnetonka, Minnesota-based  UnitedHealth Group (UNH) ,\nlawmakers heard from a division of Atlanta-based Equifax Inc.\nand a U.S. unit of Serco Group Plc, a U.K. services provider.  The U.S. delays come about a year after Ontario abandoned a\nCGI-managed effort to start a diabetes registry. CGI\nunderestimated how long the work would take and failed to\neffectively manage completion of project components, the\nprovince\u2019s auditor said in a 2012  report . Lorne Gorber, CGI\u2019s\nsenior vice president of investor relations in Montreal, didn\u2019t\nreturn messages seeking comment yesterday.  Small Portion  Even with the negative publicity, Snow and other investors\nsay the Obamacare incident is unlikely to have a lasting effect.\nScott Penner, a TD Securities Inc. analyst in Toronto, estimated\nyesterday in a note that the contract is valued at about C$290\nmillion, or less than 3 percent of CGI\u2019s annual sales of about\nC$10 billion.  Excluding some costs and gains, CGI probably will post a\nprofit of 62 cents a share, the average estimate in a Bloomberg\n survey  of 15 analysts, when it reports fiscal fourth-quarter\nresults on Nov. 14. Revenue is projected to more than double to\nC$2.52 billion. CGI employs about 69,000 people globally.  CGI dropped 0.8 percent to C$35.59 at the close in Toronto,\nparing the stock\u2019s surge  this year  to 55 percent and leaving the\ncompany\u2019s market value at about C$11.1 billion.  Watching Lemmings  \u201cThere\u2019s near-term noise but I don\u2019t think this hurts the\ncompany in the long term,\u201d said Snow of CI\u2019s Cambridge\nAdvisors. \u201cThey worked on the federal website, but they also\nworked on a lot of state websites and a lot of these have\nactually been performing well. I\u2019m just waiting for the lemmings\nto get off the cliff before I add to my holding.\u201d  CGI gained the most among Canadian information-technology\nstocks through September, rising  58 percent  to more than double\nthe 27 percent jump of the seven-member Standard & Poor\u2019s/TSX\ninformation technology  index . Since then, CGI has fallen about\n1.6 percent, trailing the index\u2019s 2 percent  advance .  Health care made up 8 percent of CGI\u2019s revenue and 10\npercent of its backlog of future contracts in the fiscal third\nquarter. Sales in that business climbed 90 percent in the third\nquarter from a year earlier, mostly driven by the impact of\nchanges in U.S. law.  CEO Roach told analysts on a July 31 conference call he\nexpected the pattern to continue \u201cas additional states stand up\nnew health exchanges, while others expand the capabilities of\nthose already in place or under development.\u201d  U.S. Sales  U.S. sales accounted for 26 percent of third-quarter\nrevenue, according to a July 31 filing. The company has offices\nin 22 states from  Vermont  to  Hawaii , as well as the District of\nColumbia, according to CGI\u2019s  website .  \u201cThere is a reputational risk for them with this Obamacare\nstory,\u201d Philippe Le Blanc, president of Cote 100 Inc., said in\na telephone interview from Saint-Bruno, Quebec. \u201cIt will all be\nforgotten in a few months. I remain confident in their long-term\nprospects,\u201d said Le Blanc, whose firm owns CGI stock among the\nC$400 million it manages.  Those prospects depend on CGI\u2019s success in integrating its\nbiggest takeover: Logica Plc of the U.K., bought last year for\n1.7 billion pounds ($2.8 billion). CGI said in April it\u2019s\ntargeting annual savings of C$375 million at Logica by the end\nof fiscal 2014, up from a previous goal of C$300 million.  Roach and Chairman Godin have spent at least $6 billion in\nthe past decade on acquisitions, gaining scale to compete with\nthe likes of IBM in selling information technology services. CGI\nhas added more than 70 companies since its start in 1976, Godin\nsaid last year.  \u201cIn the long term, the story at CGI is more about the\nintegration of Logica,\u201d said Le Blanc at Cote 100. \u201cIn the\nshort term there\u2019s a problem in the U.S., but I\u2019m confident it\nwill get sorted out.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nFrederic Tomesco in  Montreal  at \n tomesco@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nEd Dufner at \n edufner@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was 122.42089080810547 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was ",
