The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n2 COMMENTS WASHINGTON\u2014The Central Intelligence Agency on Friday released a six-year-old internal memo saying Gina Haspel wasn\u2019t to blame for the destruction of videotaped interrogations of terror suspects , an effort to shore up support on Capitol Hill for her nomination to lead the spy agency.\nThe agency declassified and released a 2011 disciplinary review , written by then-Deputy Director Michael Morell, finding that Ms. Haspel, now the deputy director, didn\u2019t order the destruction of tapes of interrogations containing evidence of what critics say is torture. \nRelated \nHere is the 2011 CIA memo clearing Gina Haspel of wrongdoing for her role in the 2005 destruction of detainee interrogation tapes. The review instead said the decision to destroy the tapes was made by Ms. Haspel\u2019s boss, Jose Rodriguez, who was then the director of the National Clandestine Service. The CIA issued Mr. Rodriguez a letter of reprimand over his behavior, which involved drafting an order to CIA field stations to destroy videotapes of interrogations of two suspects.\n\u201cI have found no fault with the performance of Ms. Haspel,\u201d Mr. Morell\u2019s review said, adding: \u201cShe drafted the cable on the direct orders of Mr. Rodriguez; she did not release that cable. It was not her decision to destroy the tapes; it was Mr. Rodriguez.\u201d\nAt issue were tapes of interrogations of two high-profile detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who were said to have been held at a CIA \u201cblack site\u201d in Thailand. During their interrogations, which took place after their captures in 2002, they were waterboarded by the CIA, a technique that simulated drowning and that many critics say amounts to torture.\nThe treatment of both prisoners was documented in reports from the CIA inspector general, as well as an exhaustive 2014 report by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which concluded that the techniques used amounted to torture.\nMr. Rodriguez has publicly defended his decision to order the destruction of the tapes in a cable drafted by Ms. Haspel, writing in his 2012 book about the decision: \u201cI was not depriving anyone of information about what was done or what was said, I was just getting rid of some ugly visuals that could put the lives of my people at risk.\u201d He has since retired from the agency.\nThe destruction of the tapes was opposed by many in Congress and the executive branch, though Mr. Rodriguez has said that nobody ordered him not to destroy the tapes.\nA special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, John Durham, to investigate the matter decided against bringing charges in the case, the Justice Department said in 2010.\nMs. Haspel is facing a tough confirmation battle on Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers are concerned about her participation in the CIA\u2019s post-9/11 interrogations and her role in the destruction of the videotaped evidence.\nSen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said in a recent statement that senators should seek assurances from Ms. Haspel during the confirmation process that the CIA would comply with guidelines prohibiting torture, and he wants her to \u201cexplain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA\u2019s interrogation program.\u201d\nMs. Haspel was in the clandestine service most of her career, meaning her public record was nonexistent until last year, when she became the deputy director. Clandestine operators are so secret that the CIA doesn\u2019t even publicize their names when they get killed. Rather, they are recognized with the addition of a star on a memorial inside the agency\u2019s Virginia headquarters, and their identities as CIA operatives often aren\u2019t disclosed until decades later.\nSince Ms. Haspel was named deputy director, she has kept a low public profile. As a result, her background is clouded in mystery, even among CIA agents.\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on her nomination May 9.\nMany members of Congress\u2014particularly Democrats critical of the interrogation program\u2014have expressed frustration that the CIA is selectively declassifying material that the agency believes is favorable to her.\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), who wrote the 2014 committee report on torture, called the disclosure \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d while the agency is \u201cstonewalling our efforts to declassify all documents related her involvement in the torture program.\u201d\nSeveral other Republicans have told The Wall Street Journal they have concerns about Ms. Haspel and haven\u2019t decided whether to support her nomination. One Democrat was unsatisfied with her answers in a private briefing about her role in the destruction of tapes of the interrogations.\nSome suggested she was the chief of the supposed black site in Thailand. Records and interviews with those who served with her indicate she wasn\u2019t there during the detention of Mr. Zubayadah, who was allegedly a high-ranking operative with the al Qaeda terror group.\nHowever, she did oversee CIA personnel who were involved in the interrogation of other suspects, current and former officials have said. Her defenders have said she was carrying out lawful orders.\nWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Nancy A.
