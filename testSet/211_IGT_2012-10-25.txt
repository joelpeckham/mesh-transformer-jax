(BYI)  settled a\npatent-infringement lawsuit brought by rival slot-machine maker\nInternational Game Technology over technology used in U.S.\ncasinos.  Bally, based in Las Vegas, will get a license to IGT\u2019s\ntechnology for monitoring slot-machine use to help decide which\nplayers deserve promotional bonuses, Mariya Barnes, an IGT\nspokeswoman, said today in a statement. Other terms of the\nsettlement were confidential, she said.  Bally said today that sales in the quarter ended Sept. 30\nrose 21 percent from a year earlier to $235.2 million, while\noperating income jumped 43 percent to $53.6 million. Gambling\nrevenue at U.S. casinos climbed 6 percent to $23.8 billion\nthrough August, the American Gaming Association said this month.  Delaware, Indiana,  Missouri  and  New Jersey  registered\ndeclines, while  Nevada , the biggest U.S. casino market, posted a\n2.4 percent increase through July, the group said Oct. 2.  Mike Trask, a Bally spokesman, didn\u2019t immediately return a\ncall for comment on the IGT settlement today.  IGT, the world\u2019s largest slot-machine maker, sued Bally in\n2006 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, seeking to block\nthe use of Bally\u2019s \u201cPower Bonusing\u201d system in casinos on the\nEast Coast and in Nevada. IGT, based in Reno, Nevada, alleged\nthat Bally infringed IGT\u2019s \u201cACSC Power Winners\u201d technology.  U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson ruled in 2009 that IGT\u2019s\npatents on the slot-machine technology were valid and Bally had\ninfringed them. She also ruled that Bally\u2019s \u201cSDS Power\nWinners,\u201d \u201cPower Bank\u201d and \u201cPower Promotions\u201d technologies\ndidn\u2019t infringe IGT patents, IGT said at the time.
