The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTempleton Asset Management Ltd.\u2019s\n Mark Mobius  plans to increase his holdings of Turkish stocks,\nwhich rank among the cheapest in emerging markets even after\ngains pushed prices to record highs.  \n Turkey\u2019s  ISE National-100  index rose 15 percent this year,\nthe most among major European gauges, to an all-time peak today.\nValuations at 10.7 times reported earnings, the  highest  since\nMarch, are 30 percent below the 15.3 times multiple for the\nbenchmark  MSCI Emerging Markets Index , according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  \n \u201cWe already have over $1 billion invested in Turkey today\nand expect to invest more,\u201d said Mobius, who oversees about $34\nbillion as the Singapore-based chairman of Templeton, in an e-\nmailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. \u201cWe remain\noptimistic about the long term potential of the Turkish\neconomy\u201d and prices are attractive, he said.  \n The ISE-100 climbed after the government said June 30 that\n gross domestic product  increased 11.7 percent in the first\nquarter from a year earlier and inflation slowed to the lowest\nsince January as the country pulled out of its deepest recession\nin more than a decade. The growth rate was the fastest among the\nGroup of 20 major economies, excluding China, and compares with\nan average contraction of 0.03 percent in 14 central and eastern\nEuropean countries, Bloomberg data show.  \n Turkey\u2019s $620 billion economy probably expanded at an\nannual rate of 9 percent to 10 percent in the second quarter,\nsaid  Ziya Akkurt , chief executive officer of  Akbank TAS , the\ncountry\u2019s second-biggest publicly traded bank by market value,\nin an interview with Bloomberg HT television yesterday.  \n Economic Bounce  \n \u201cGrowth is recovering very nicely and we are still\npositive on Turkey as valuations are very attractive,\u201d said\n Thomas Wilson , who runs an emerging Europe fund at Schroders\nInvestment Management in London and helps oversee about $23\nbillion. \u201cThe market re-rated to a certain extent and there is\nscope for further positive re-rating.\u201d  \n The economy is rebounding after shrinking at the fastest\npace on record in the first quarter of 2009 as the global\nfinancial crisis reduced the capital inflows needed to curb the\ncountry\u2019s  current account deficit . Turkey imports almost all the\noil and gas it consumes, swelling the current account gap.  \n While government budget deficits widen across Europe,\nraising concern for debt sustainability, Turkey is collecting\nmore taxes as the economy expands, helping to curb its own\nfinancing gap and reduce the cost of borrowing.  \n Crisis Management  \n Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s  management of the\ncountry\u2019s debt, which has remained below the Maastricht criteria\nof 60 percent of economic output since 2004, prompted ratings\nupgrades by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Standard & Poor\u2019s and\nFitch Ratings in the past seven months. The country\u2019s debt level\nmay peak at 49 percent of GDP this year and decline to 48\npercent by 2012, according to government projections.  \n Turkey, which needed about $55 billion in  loans  from the\nInternational Monetary Fund from 1999 to 2008 to finance budget\ndeficits, abandoned plans to sign a new loan accord in March.\nThe country has no need for more lending, IMF Managing Director\n Dominique Strauss-Kahn  said during a June 9 interview.  \n The budget deficit in the first six months of the year\nnarrowed by a third from the same period of 2009 to 15.4 billion\nliras ($10.2 billion), the  Finance Ministry  said on July 15. The\ngovernment\u2019s year-end goal is a deficit of 50.2 billion liras,\nor about 5 percent of GDP.  \n Projected Value  \n Stocks in Istanbul trade below the 11.5 times projected\n2010 earnings for Poland\u2019s  WIG20 Index  and 14.5 times for\nBrazil\u2019s  Bovespa .  \n The ISE-100 rose 0.6 percent to 60,734.47 at 2:05 p.m. in\nIstanbul today.  \n Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS , Turkey\u2019s biggest bank by market\nvalue, led gains on the ISE this year, returning 30 percent\ncompared with a 2.7 percent gain for  OAO Sberbank , Russia\u2019s\nlargest bank, and a gain of 5.5 percent for Poland\u2019s  PKO Bank\nPolski SA . Garanti trades at 10.2 times 2010 estimated earnings,\ncompared with 13 for Sberbank and 16.5 for PKO Bank.  Turkiye Is\nBankasi AS , Turkey\u2019s biggest publicly traded lender by assets,\nhas risen 33 percent this year to trade at 9.35 times estimated\nearnings.  \n Is Investment, the country\u2019s biggest broker, raised its\nrecommendation to \u201cbuy\u201d for the ISE-100 index and projected\nthe gauge may rally 23 percent in the next 12 months from\nyesterday\u2019s close,  Emre Sezan , a research manager at Is\nInvestment said in a press conference today. Sezan recommended\nbuying Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS, and state-run lenders Turkiye\nHalk Bankasi AS and Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi AS.  \n Vulnerable  \n Turkey\u2019s markets are vulnerable to any worsening in the\ncredit crisis in Greece, Portugal and Spain, said  Mehmet Buyukeksi , head of the Turkish Exporters\u2019 Assembly.  \n \u201cSome sort of event in the eurozone periphery is the\nbiggest risk factor for the country as it still depends on\nraising money externally,\u201d said  Paul Biszko , an emerging\nmarkets strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, in a\ntelephone interview. \u201cTurkey still has structural issues it has\nto work through.\u201d  \n Moody\u2019s rates Turkey Ba2, two levels below investment\ngrade, after lifting the country in January. Fitch raised its\nrating to BB+ in December, or one step below investment grade,\nand S&P boosted its ranking in February. All three cited budget\nmanagement and the strength of Turkey\u2019s banking system, which\nposted record profits last year and required no government funds\nafter the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.  \n \u2018Transforming Itself\u2019  \n The stock rally is occurring as banks lend more to\nconsumers and companies. The central bank has kept the  benchmark\ninterest rate  at an historic low of 7 percent and  inflation  has\nslowed to a three-decade low.  \n \u201cTurkey is in the process of transforming itself into a\nvery competitive and fast-growing economy, backed by manageable\ninflation, low interest rates and a stable government,\u201d Mobius\nsaid.  \n Economic growth rates mean Turkey created as many new jobs\nin the past year as the whole of Europe, Sabah newspaper\nreported on July 19, citing Finance Minister  Mehmet Simsek .  \n \u201cWe continue to see Turkey leading the way in the\nregion,\u201d said  Simon Quijano-Evans , head of emerging-market\nresearch at Credit Agricole Cheuvreux in Vienna, in an\ninterview. \u201cMarkets are rewarding low debt and political\ncredibility.\u201d  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Seda Sezer  in Istanbul at \n ssezer2@bloomberg.net .  \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management Ltd.
