 "context": "The following article called 'AIA Advances to Record on New Business Growth: Hong Kong Mover' was published on 2013-10-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAIA Group Ltd. (1299) , the  second-largest \nAsia-based insurer by market value,  rose  to a record in Hong\nKong trading after its value of new business climbed a stronger-than-expected 26 percent in the third quarter.  The insurer surged 4.4 percent, the most in more than 13\nmonths, to close at HK$40.05. The stock, which touched HK$40.10\nearlier in the day, was the  most  actively-traded stock by value\nin the 50-member benchmark  Hang Seng Index  today.  AIA\u2019s new business value, measuring projected future\nprofitability of new policies, increased to a record $379\nmillion from $300 million a year earlier, the Hong Kong-based\ncompany said in a statement to the city\u2019s stock exchange today.\nThe increase beat the consensus estimate of about 20 percent,\naccording to a Credit Suisse Group AG research note today.  Credit Suisse analysts Arjan van Veen and Frances Deng\nraised the insurer\u2019s earnings estimate this year by 9 percent,\nciting in their report \u201csubsiding macro headwinds in the last\ncouple of months\u201d.  AIA has sustained a quarterly  rise  of more than 20 percent\nin new business value even as currencies in several of its major\nmarkets depreciated against the dollar amid anticipation of a\nreduction of monetary stimulus in the U.S. The insurer sells\npolicies in local currencies and reports its financial results\nin dollars.  \u201cDebate over the timing of supportive U.S. monetary policy\ncaused capital market volatility in the third quarter and tested\nthose countries running current account deficits,\u201d AIA\u2019s\nmanagement said in today\u2019s statement. \u201cAsian central banks\nresponded appropriately.\u201d  Asian Currencies  Larger regional economies continue to benefit from a shift\ntoward domestic sources of growth and the more trade-dependent\nmarkets will benefit from a pickup in global trade as a result\nof an improved economic outlook in  China  and  Japan , AIA said in\nthe statement.  Depreciating Southeast Asian currencies may moderate AIA\u2019s\nnew business value growth over the short term, Goldman Sachs\nGroup Inc. analysts Mancy Sun and Yao Lu wrote in an Oct. 16\nreport. AIA generates about half of its new business value\ngrowth from  Southeast Asia , they said.  The Thai bhat and  Singapore  dollar have depreciated more\nthan 1.3 percent against the dollar this year.  Thailand , which\nhas seen a widening current-account deficit, and Singapore are\nAIA\u2019s second- and third-largest markets by new business value in\nthe first half, behind Hong Kong.  ING Purchase  The currency in  Malaysia , where AIA completed a $1.7\nbillion  acquisition  of ING Groep NV\u2019s business in December to\nbecome the largest life insurer in the market, lost 3 percent of\nits value against the dollar this year.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\nwarned earlier this month that emerging  Asia \u2019s medium-term\neconomic growth faces risks from the reduction of monetary\nstimulus by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Exchange-rate fluctuations\nand rapidly rising wages in Southeast Asia and China may curb\ndemand from advanced economies for their manufacturing exports\nover the next five years, it added.  AIA\u2019s annualized new premium, the sum of first-year\npremiums and 10 percent of single-premiums, grew 21 percent to\n$839 million, it said.  New business margin, or the value of new business as a\npercentage of annualized new premium, expanded by 2.1 percentage\npoints to 44.7 percent on improved product mix.
