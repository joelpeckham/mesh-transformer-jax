 "context": "The following article called 'Stocks Rise, Treasuries Fall; Oil Slides to Two-Month Low' was published on 2013-03-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. stocks rose, with the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average closing within 40 points of a record, amid\noptimism the Federal Reserve will continue to provide monetary\nstimulus. Commodities dropped on concern changes in  China \u2019s\npolicies may slow growth and hurt the global recovery.  The Dow rose 38.16 points to 14,127.82 while the Standard &\nPoor\u2019s 500 Index advanced 0.5 percent to 1,525.20 after\nretreating 0.4 percent earlier. The S&P GSCI Index of\ncommodities fell for a fifth day, the longest slump of the year,\nas oil dipped below $90 a barrel for the first time this year.\n Japan \u2019s five-year rate  slid  two basis points to a record 0.095\npercent.  Italy \u2019s 10-year  yield  rose amid concern the country may\nneed to hold another election. U.S. Treasuries fell.  Financial stocks helped lead gains as Federal Reserve Vice\nChairman Janet Yellen said the central bank should press on with\n$85 billion in monthly bond buying while tracking possible costs\nand risks from the program. Earlier losses in global stocks\nfollowed data showing China\u2019s service industries grew last month\nat the slowest pace since September and the cabinet last week\ntightened mortgage rules to cool the property market.  \u201cThe Fed is going to be our friend for an extended period\nof time,\u201d Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Boston-\nbased Fiduciary Trust Co., which manages $9.5 billion, said by\ntelephone. \u201cAnd as the old adage goes, don\u2019t fight the Fed,\u201d\nhe said. \u201cRisk assets are going to do reasonable well as long\nas the Fed and other central banks have got their checkbooks\nopen, which is what they have right now.\u201d  Budget Talks  While President  Barack Obama  phoned Democratic and\nRepublican legislators over the weekend, his aides and\ncongressional leaders signaled automatic spending cuts would\ncontinue for weeks, possibly months. Both sides indicated that\nrevisiting the reductions would begin after they resolve a\nlooming confrontation over legislation that\u2019s needed to keep\nfederal agencies running beyond March 27, placing a premium on\navoiding a government shutdown.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to be choppy this month,\u201d said Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Boston-based Fiduciary\nTrust Co., which manages $9.5 billion. \u201cWe have this March 27th\ndebt ceiling limit coming up. The partisan rancor is probably\ngoing to be pretty active coming out of  Washington  for the next\nfew weeks.\u201d  Investors have reduced bearish stock bets to the lowest\nlevel since at least 2007 as the bull market in American\nequities begins its fifth year.  Short Interest  Short sales in the S&P Composite 1,500 Index fell to 5.6\npercent of shares available for trading in February, down from a\nrecord 12 percent during the credit crisis and the lowest ever\nin data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group and Bloomberg\nstarting six years ago. The last time the number of shares\nborrowed and sold short approached this level, the equity gauge\nlost 3.3 percent in the next three months.  Bulls say the capitulation by market bears shows the rally\nremains intact and that more money will flow into stocks after\nindividuals sent $37.9 billion to mutual funds in January, the\nmost since 2004. It also means a source of demand is\ndiminishing, a traditional signal for caution in an aging bull\nmarket. Less than 1 percent of the shares of Ford Motor Co. and\n Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  have been borrowed and sold short by\nspeculators hoping to return them to owners once prices fall.  Billionaire investor  Warren Buffett  said stocks will do\nwell and the greater risk is to sit out the market\u2019s rally.  \u2018Do Fine\u2019  \u201cAmerican business will do fine over time. And stocks will\ndo well just as certainly,\u201d Buffett said in his annual letter\nto shareholders. \u201cSince the basic game is so favorable, Charlie\nand I believe it\u2019s a terrible mistake to try to dance in and out\nof it based upon the turn of tarot cards, the predictions of\n\u2019experts,\u2019 or the ebb and flow of business activity. The risks\nof being out of the game are huge compared to the risks of being\nin it,\u201d he said, referring to Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman\nCharles Munger.  The S&P 500 Financials Index climbed 0.9 percent and the\nconsumer-discretionary gauge rose 1 percent to a record to help\nlead gains among the  10 main groups  in the S&P 500 today. Home\nDepot Inc. and Citigroup Inc. rallied almost 2 percent paced the\nadvance.  Airlines Rally  Delta Air Lines Inc. rose 5.6 percent to a five-year high\nof $15.65, pacing a rally in airlines, after increasing the\nlower end of its guidance for unit revenue.

Repsol Gains  Repsol SA added 2.5 percent as Spain\u2019s largest oil producer\nsold a 5.04 percent stake to Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore \u2019s\nstate-owned investment company. The oil producer had said it\nwould consider selling shares after  Argentina \u2019s government\nseized its YPF business last April.  European finance ministers were meeting in Brussels today,\nwhile a top aide to Italy\u2019s Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani said the country may need to hold another election this\nyear.
