 "context": "The following article called 'Dated Brent Falls as Forties Offers Slide; Urals at 2-Month Low' was published on 2007-11-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDated Brent fell for the first time\nin a week relative to the cost of January oil as sellers of\nNorth Sea cargoes including Chevron Corp. failed to attract\nbuyers.  Russia 's Urals fell to a 2-month low.  \n Dated Brent for loading in 10 to 21 days was at a premium of\n35 cents to January oil today, compared with a 75-cent premium\nyesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd. Physical crude\nfor January delivery was at $88.85 a barrel at 12:45 p.m. London\ntime.  \n The cost of a cargo of Urals crude for delivery in\nnorthwest Europe was at a discount of $3.35 to Dated Brent\ntoday, compared with a discount of $3.18 yesterday, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. That's the biggest discount since\nSept. 28.  \n Dated Brent, a price benchmark for about two-thirds of the\nworld's oil, from Europe,  Africa  and Russia, is set by the\ncheapest of four crude grades: Shell's Brent blend, the BP Plc-operated Forties, StatoilHydro ASA's Oseberg and\n ConocoPhillips (COP) 's Ekofisk blend. Forties is the cheapest grade.  \n The price of Forties fell, causing the drop in Dated Brent,\nafter companies including Chevron Corp. reduced offers for\ncargoes without attracting buyers. Chevron offered a shipment\nloading between Dec. 11 and Dec. 13 at a premium of 25 cents to\na forward price for oil, the company said. Two other cargoes\nwere offered by unconfirmed sellers.  \n As a result, the so-called Forties differential, the spread\nbetween the cost of a Forties cargo loading in 10 to 21 days and\na forward price for Dated Brent, was at a premium of 27 cents,\ncompared with a premium of 55 cents yesterday. The Brent blend\ndifferential, the next cheapest grade, was unchanged at a\npremium of 60 cents.  \n The price of Urals in northwestern  Europe  has weakened\nbefore a scheduled rise in the supply of cargoes in December.\nPreliminary loading programs showed last week that Urals\nshipments will rise 4.3 percent next month.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\nAlexander Kwiatkowski in London at \n akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net   \n To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nStephen Voss at   sev@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was 21.29361915588379 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of ASA  Gold and Precious Metals Limited was ",
