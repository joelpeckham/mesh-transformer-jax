 "context": "The following article called 'Ex-Siemens Executive Chapero Said to Attempt Hearing-Aids Deal' was published on 2013-08-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nValentin Chapero, the former chief\nexecutive officer of  Siemens AG (SIE) \u2019s hearing-aids  business ,\napproached the company to broker a sale of the unit to a\nprivate-equity firm, said people familiar with the matter.  Chapero, who left the company in 2002 to run Swiss hearing-aid maker  Sonova Holding AG (SOON)  and then went on to start investment\ncompany Valamero last year, is trying to persuade Siemens to\nsell the unit, the people said. The Munich-based company ended\ntalks with buyout firms in 2010 because bids didn\u2019t meet a\ntarget for least 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion), people familiar\nwith the matter said at the time.  The former Siemens executive would offer to take a\nleadership role and the private-equity partner would provide\nmost of the money, the people said, asking not to be identified\nas the talks are private. Siemens spokesman Alexander Becker and\nChapero yesterday declined to comment.  Siemens, which last month appointed former Finance Chief\nJoe Kaeser as new CEO, first wants to complete already announced\ndisposals for assets in water treatment, parcel automation,\nairport logistics and air freight, before considering another\nattempt to dispose of the hearing-aid division, the people said.\nA potential sale of the hearing-aid business is therefore\nunlikely to happen this year, they said.  \u2018Attractive Multiples\u2019  \u201cThe company failed to sell its hearing aids unit in 2010,\nbut we believe that it may once again consider a divestment,\u201d\nCommerzbank analyst Ingo-Martin Schachel said in a note to\nclients this month. \u201cThe hearing aids segment is the only\nremaining business-to-consumer activity of the company.\nAdditionally, the hearing aids sector trades on attractive\nmultiples, which would make a divestment appear even more\nattractive.\u201d  Schachel said the unit may have an enterprise value of 1.7\nbillion euros, based on estimated annual sales of 800 million\neuros and earnings before interest and taxes of 136 million\neuros.  Siemens may also consider an initial public offering or a\nspin-off of the unit, one of the people said.  \u201cWe regard the listing of the unit as the most likely\noption, which could involve either an IPO or as a spin-off,\u201d\nSchachel said.  Siemens shares yesterday reversed losses in Frankfurt\ntrading and ended up 0.3 percent at 81.46 euros after earlier\ndeclining as much as 0.8 percent. The stock has gained 2.3\npercent this year, valuing the company at 72 billion euros,\nwhile the German DAX index rose 7.7 percent.  Independent Unit  During the 2010 process, the asset drew interest from\nbuyout firms including Permira Advisers LLP,  KKR & Co. (KKR) ,  Nordic\nCapital , Hellman & Friedman, Cinven Partners,  Bain Capital  and\n BC Partners , people familiar with the matter said at the time.  In addition to private-equity firms, makers of medical\nequipment such as Hansaton GmbH and Cochlear Ltd. were also\ninterested, the people said. Other competitors of the Siemens\nunit include Sonova and William Demant of  Denmark .  Siemens,  Europe \u2019s biggest engineering company, is revamping\nits health-care unit to focus more on cheaper clinical products\nsuch as x-ray and ultrasound that are in higher demand in\n emerging markets . After the failed 2010 sale, the company said\nit will run the hearing-aid division as an independent unit\nwithin the healthcare sector.  Siemens, which also makes high-speed trains and power\ngrids, has been making the hearing products for more than 100\nyears, and the business is based in Erlangen in southern\n Germany , home to some of the company\u2019s largest production sites.  Insider Probe  Chapero this year has been in contact with private-equity\ncompanies to see if they would be interested in the asset, two\nof the people said, adding that he has also approached senior\nSiemens managers several times, including as recently as this\nmonth.  Chapero resigned as CEO of Sonova in March 2011 along with\nthe chief financial officer and chairman amid an investigation\nof insider sales at the Staefa, Switzerland-based hearing-aid\nmaker. The Zurich prosecutor later determined the executives\ndidn\u2019t use insider knowledge to earn money.
