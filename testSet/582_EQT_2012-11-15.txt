The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCharterhouse Capital Partners LLP, a\nLondon-based buyout firm, is seeking financing of more than 2\nbillion euros ($2.5 billion) for potential buyers of German\nenergy-metering business Ista International GmbH, according to\npeople familiar with the offer.  Banks are offering so-called staple financing of about 7\ntimes Ista\u2019s estimated earnings before interest, tax,\ndepreciation and amortization of about 315 million euros, said\nthree of the people, who asked not to be identified as talks are\nprivate. Private-equity firms often arrange staple financing to\nsupport a sale, as it shows other buyout firms an estimate of\nhow much debt the deal can draw and the return they can achieve.  Charterhouse plans to kick off the Ista sale in the first\nhalf and will seek more than 3 billion euros, the people said.\nThe banks offering the most attractive staple financing will\nprobably get the advisory mandate, which could be awarded by the\nend of this year, the people said. Some of the banks approached\nfor staple financing have offered put up the full amount, one\nperson said.  Ista, based in Essen,  Germany , provides electricity, water,\nheat and gas-meter reading services and hardware to property\nmanagers, home owners and utilities in 25 countries. The company\nmay benefit from tougher European Union rules that require\nenergy distributors to save 1.5 percent of their sale volumes\nannually, as part of efforts to meet the EU\u2019s target of 20\npercent energy savings by 2020.  Large Transaction  Charterhouse declined to make officials available for\ncomment. A CVC Capital Partners Ltd. spokeswoman declined to\ncomment. An Ista spokesman couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for\ncomment.  Ista could be one of the largest private-equity asset\ntransactions in Germany next year. Springer Science & Business\nMedia, the German academic publisher being sold by EQT Partners\nAB and state owner, may fetch between 3 billion euros and 4\nbillion euros, people familiar with the sale said last month.  Charterhouse bought Ista from CVC Capital Partners Ltd. for\n2.4 billion euros in 2007. CVC re-invested part of the proceeds\nto buy a stake in Ista.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Deutsche\nBank AG advised CVC on the sale at the time, which may make them\nwell positioned to win the M&A mandate, the people said.
