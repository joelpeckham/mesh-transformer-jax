Re/Max\nhad net income of $33.3 million last year, compared with income\nof $24.2 million in 2011 and a loss of $2.75 million in 2010.  \u201cThe company is very cash-rich so it is our intention to\nuse the money for further acquisitions and to accelerate the\ngrowth and our market share throughout the U.S. and  Canada ,\u201d\nRe/Max Chairman David Liniger said in a telephone interview\ntoday. \u201cWe have to be franchising in the real estate sector and\nwith the improving market, virtually worldwide, the timing was\nabsolutely perfect.\u201d  Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose 1.7 percent in\nAugust to the highest level in more than six years, the National\nAssociation of Realtors said on Sept. 19.  Home prices  in 20 U.S.\ncities rose 12.4 percent in the 12 months through July, the most\nin more than seven years, the S&P/Case-Shiller index showed on\nSept. 24.
