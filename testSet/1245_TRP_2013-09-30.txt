 "context": "The following article called 'Oil Sands Deals Dive as State Firms Scrutinized' was published on 2013-09-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOil-sands deals are getting done at\nthe slowest pace in nine years as the Canadian government\u2019s\nheightened scrutiny of investments by foreign state-owned\ncompanies hinders transactions.  Industry Canada officials are now vetting deals that don\u2019t\nrequire approval under the nation\u2019s foreign-takeover law,\naccording to two people who have advised on transactions\ninvolving state-owned companies. Even foreign investors not\nusually deemed state owned are being asked to prove they aren\u2019t\ncontrolled or influenced by government, including whether the\nstate has the power to appoint directors, said another person\nfamiliar with the process. The people asked not to be identified\nas the details aren\u2019t public.  The federal government is also probing more proposed\nacquisitions involving state-owned firms to see if they pose a\nthreat to national security, said Julie Soloway, a partner at\nBlake, Cassels & Graydon LLP in Toronto.  \u201cThey are definitely digging deeper on these\ntransactions,\u201d Soloway said in a phone interview on Sept. 12.  Mergers and acquisitions in the oil sands fell this year to\nthe lowest since 2004, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Smaller\ndevelopers including  Athabasca Oil Corp. (ATH)  and  BlackPearl\nResources Inc. (PXX)  are lagging behind peers after the government\nintroduced rules to block state-owned buyers from purchasing\noil-sands companies. Athabasca fell 24 percent since the rules\nwere made public on Dec. 7, versus a 6.4 percent gain on the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s/TSX Energy Index.  Additional Challenge  \u201cYou\u2019ve had companies that have taken a step back and\nlooked at what they can do and what they can\u2019t do and I think a\nfew transactions that were going to proceed have not proceeded\nbecause of this,\u201d said George Gosbee, chief executive officer\nof AltaCorp Capital Inc., a Calgary-based investment bank.  The additional government scrutiny adds to challenges\naffecting Canadian energy stocks, including a slower economy in\n China  and pipeline shortages that have helped push Canadian\nheavy crude prices to $31.20 a barrel  below  the U.S. benchmark.\nSpot prices for Western Canadian Select, the heavy grade, closed\nat $71.12 on Sept. 27, versus $102.32 for West Texas\nIntermediate, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is examining whether the\nadded scrutiny is contributing to a drop in investment by state-owned companies in a sector that depends on foreign cash, Jim Prentice, vice chairman of the bank and a former Canadian\nindustry minister, said in Calgary.  \u2018Energy Superpower\u2019  \u201cIt behooves us to look at this and to assess what the\ncauses are and to make sure that, as a country, we\u2019re careful,\u201d\nPrentice said in an interview on Sept. 18.  Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who has called Canada an\nemerging \u201cenergy superpower,\u201d is asserting control over the\nnation\u2019s resources after about $51 billion in investments by\nstate-owned firms in the Canadian oil and gas industry over the\nlast seven years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The\nnation\u2019s oil sands in Alberta are the world\u2019s third largest\nsource of crude reserves and the starting point for the proposed\nKeystone XL pipeline to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Canada in December approved  Cnooc Ltd. (883) \u2019s $15.1 billion\nacquisition of Calgary producer Nexen Inc., and the C$5.2\nbillion ($5.05 billion) purchase of Progress Energy Resources\nCorp. by Petroliam Nasional Bhd.,  Malaysia \u2019s state-owned energy\ncompany. At the same time, Harper said the government would\npermit further purchases of oil-sands businesses by state-owned\nenterprises only under \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d  \u2018Perfect Storm\u2019  The government, which already vets foreign takeovers above\nC$344 million, also said it will \u201ccarefully monitor\u201d deals\ninvolving state-owned enterprises in the world\u2019s 11th-largest\neconomy, and will \u201cact to safeguard Canadian interests\u201d when\nit appears that such acquisitions will \u201cundermine the private\nsector orientation of an industry.\u201d  The rules created a \u201cperfect storm\u201d to reduce deal\nactivity in the oil sands, where stocks had already been dragged\ndown by lower oil and gas prices, said Dan Cheng of Matco\nFinancial Inc., who helps manage C$430 million from Calgary.  Canadian energy companies have underperformed U.S. peers by\n27 percentage points on Standard & Poor\u2019s indexes during the\npast five years, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) \u2019s $5.3 billion Keystone XL pipeline is in\nits sixth year of U.S. review, a delay that has led to pipeline\nbottlenecks. Economic growth in China, the world\u2019s largest\nenergy consumer, is projected by analysts to rise 7.6 percent in\n2013, the lowest annual increase since a 7.6 percent expansion\nin 1999, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Voting Rights  Now Industry Canada is reviewing transactions involving\nstate-owned enterprises that fall below the C$344 million\nthreshold that triggers an automatic review, according to two\npeople familiar with discussions with the department.  All foreign investors are also now being asked a set of\nquestions on state control, including whether a state owns a\nthird or more of the investor\u2019s voting rights and whether a\ngovernment has the power to appoint managers and members of the\ncompany\u2019s board, said one of the people familiar with the talks.  Industry Minister James Moore said foreign takeovers have\nbeen \u201celevated to a new degree of sensitivity\u201d since the Nexen\nand Progress decisions.  \u201cThis is something that has greater attention than ever\nbefore, and we want to make sure that any decision is given the\nweight and consideration that it\u2019s due and the department is\nallocating the resources and talent to these kinds of\ndecisions,\u201d Moore said in an interview last month at his Ottawa\noffice.  Pipeline Venture  TransCanada and a unit of  PetroChina Co. (857)  said in October\nthey would work together on a C$3 billion ($2.9 billion) oil\npipeline through Alberta. After Harper announced the new\nforeign-takeover rules in December, the government asked the\ncompanies to halt the project while it examined the deal on\nnational security grounds, said a person familiar with the\nissue.  The review surprised company officials, because the\ngovernment initially welcomed the project, said the person, who\nasked not to be identified because the discussions aren\u2019t\npublic. The project didn\u2019t involve oil-sands production and was\na joint venture, not a takeover.  The pipeline is still on schedule, said Davis Sheremata, a\nTransCanada spokesman, declining to comment on discussions with\ngovernments. Mao Zefeng, a spokesman in Beijing for PetroChina,\nthe publicly traded arm of state-owned China National Petroleum\nCorp., said by phone the company has no comment on the project.  Athabasca, BlackPearl  Industry Canada\u2019s media relations office didn\u2019t immediately\nrespond to a request for comment on the department\u2019s scrutiny of\ntransactions involving state-owned enterprises, including the\ndeal between TransCanada and PetroChina.  The C$751 million purchase by Exxon Mobil Corp. and\nImperial Oil Ltd. of ConocoPhillips\u2019 Clyden property in  Alberta \nmarked the first \u201csignificant\u201d oil-sands transaction in 2013,\naccording to a report this month by Peters & Co., a Calgary\ninvestment adviser. The deal activity compares with $16.1\nbillion in mergers and acquisitions involving the oil sands last\nyear, including the Nexen takeover.  Investors betting on an Athabasca Oil takeover have left\nthe stock, Andre De Leebeeck, a company spokesman, said in a\nphone interview.  BlackPearl has had similar share price declines to\nAthabasca, falling 35 percent since the rules were announced.\nJohn Festival, chief executive officer of the company, didn\u2019t\nreturn a phone message seeking comment.  Seeking Clarity  Athabasca, which did two joint venture deals with\nPetroChina in the oil sands, has been seeking clarity for months\non how the government defines control by a state-owned company\nto speed talks on potential new partnerships, De Leebeeck said.  Canada\u2019s new foreign-takeover policies were more stringent\nthan expected and have resulted in lower investment from state-owned companies even outside the oil sands, said John Brussa,\nvice chairman at Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP in Calgary.  \u201cThat policy came a bit out of left field,\u201d Brussa said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s made the SOEs quite reticent to stick their toe in the\nwater, generally,\u201d he said, referring to state-owned\nenterprises.
