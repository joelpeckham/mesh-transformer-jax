 "context": "The following article called 'F-22 Oxygen System May Cause Pilot Ills, Lawmakers Say' was published on 2012-07-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe investigation into why pilots\nflying  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) \u2019s F-22 Raptor keep getting dizzy\nand disoriented is focusing again on whether the plane\u2019s oxygen\nsystem works well enough at high altitudes, lawmakers said.  Senator  Mark Warner , a  Virginia  Democrat, and\nRepresentative Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, said\ntoday that  Honeywell International Inc. (HON) \u2019s On-Board Oxygen\nGeneration System \u201cmay not provide enough oxygen for pilots\noperating at higher altitudes while sustaining powerful G-\nforces.\u201d  Honeywell has said that the system works well, and during a\nyearlong investigation the Air Force has turned in recent months\nto other possible causes for the symptoms of hypoxia, or oxygen\ndeprivation, including ill-fitting pressure vests worn by the\npilots and the possibility of contaminants in the air.  Citing information they obtained from the Air Force, the\nlawmakers said an Air Standardization Coordinating Committee\n\u201capparently has concluded that the quantity of oxygen required\nfor pilots to perform full F-22 operations may, in fact, be\ngreater than what is supplied\u201d by the oxygen system.  The assertions were made in a letter today to  Air Force \nSecretary Michael Donley in which the lawmakers sought\nadditional answers to the mystery of the F-22\u2019s oxygen-related\nproblems.  Honeywell\u2019s Comment  A Honeywell Aerospace spokesman, Nathan Drevna, said in a\nstatement that the company\u2019s oxygen system \u201cis performing as\ndesigned in accordance with U.S. Air Force specifications.\u201d  \u201cHoneywell continues to support the USAF and the F-22\nindustry team in understanding the cause for the physiological\nincidents leading to various F-22 fleet issues,\u201d he said.  Unable to explain episodes of dizziness and other ailments,\nthe Air Force has been looking at a variety of possible causes,\nfrom the prosaic -- hoses, masks and the pressure vests -- to\nthe top-secret coatings and adhesives used in the plane\u2019s radar-\nabsorbing stealth skin that makes it harder to track.  The lawmakers suggested on a conference call with reporters\ntoday that the Air Force is returning to a lack of sufficient\noxygen as the leading theory for the hypoxia problem.  \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve come a bit full-circle back to\nthat,\u201d Warner said.  Kinzinger, urging caution, said, \u201cThis may be the leading\ntheory right now, but in the last few times we\u2019ve had a leading\ntheory, we\u2019ve been burned.\u201d  Pressure Vest  The Air Force focused last month on a pressure vest worn by\nF-22 pilots that \u201cincreases the difficulty of pilot breathing\nunder certain circumstances,\u201d according to a statement from Air\nCombat Command.  Even after the Air Force instructed pilots to stop wearing\nthe vests, additional hypoxia incidents were reported, most\nrecently on July 6.  At least two dozen pilots and six ground-maintenance\nworkers have reported symptoms associated with a lack of oxygen.\nThere have been at least 11 reported incidents since the plane\nresumed flying operations last year after a four-month halt\nbecause of safety concerns.  Warner and Kinzinger said in the letter that there have\nbeen additional hypoxia-related incidents that the Air Force\nhasn\u2019t disclosed, including a July 6 incident at Joint Base\n Pearl Harbor  in  Hawaii , a \u201crestricted airflow\u201d incident in\nlate June at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Virginia, and a May 31\nincident at Tyndall Air Force Base in  Florida  in which a pilot\nhit the runway without extending the plane\u2019s landing gear.  Earlier Finding  Gregory Martin, a retired general who headed a study of the\nF-22 for the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, told reporters\nat a March 29 Pentagon briefing that the plane\u2019s oxygen system\n\u201cmight not produce as much oxygen as it would when it was not\nunder G,\u201d or a high level of acceleration. Still, he said, the\noxygen level was \u201cnever in an area of concern.\u201d  The assertions by Warner and Kinzinger indicate that the\nAir Force may be revisiting that assumption.  In May, Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  imposed new safety\nmeasures that include limiting flight durations and speeding the\ninstallation of a back-up oxygen system.  Lockheed Martin, the world\u2019s largest defense contractor,\nwon a $19 million contract in June for the back-up oxygen supply\nsystem, which is scheduled to be installed by the end of next\nyear.  Warner and Kinzinger asked the Air Force in their letter to\nspecify whether Lockheed\u2019s new contract was awarded without\ncompetition.
