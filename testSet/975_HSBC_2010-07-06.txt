The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNigeria and China have signed an\nagreement to build the West African nation\u2019s biggest oil\nrefinery at a cost of $8 billion, ThisDay  reported , without\nsaying where it got the information.  \n The 300,000 barrel-a-day refinery will be located in the\n Lekki Free Trade Zone  in Lagos state, according to the report.\nChina State Construction Engineering Corp. will take up 80\npercent of the project funding, while government-owned Nigerian\nNational Petroleum Corp. will be responsible for the rest, the\nLagos-based newspaper said.  \n Nigeria\u2019s four existing refineries have a combined capacity\nof 445,000 barrels a day. As they are unable to operate at full\nproduction because of ageing equipment and poor maintenance,\nAfrica\u2019s largest crude oil producer has to depend on imports to\nmeet its oil-product needs.  \n Chinese investors will hold a stake of at least 25 percent\nin the refinery, ThisDay said, citing  Billy Agha , Nigerian\nNational\u2019s executive director in charge of engineering and\ntechnology. Calls to China State Construction\u2019s press office for\ncomment went unanswered.  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Ying Wang  in Beijing at \n ywang30@bloomberg.net   \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                           \n                 \n                 \n                                       \n                                   \n               \n                        \n           \n                          July 6 (Bloomberg) -- Frederic Neumann, an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, talks with Bloomberg's Rishaad Salamat about India's competition with  China for natural resources.\n     Indian Oil Minister Murli Deora traveled to Nigeria, Angola, Uganda, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela this year, leading a record number of delegations to gain oil for the world\u2019s third-fastest-growing major economy.
