The Fed has already raised rates once this year and is widely expected to go twice again in 2018. FEDWATCH\nThe U.S. consumer price index rose 0.2 percent last month, below analyst forecasts of 0.3 percent, as a moderation in healthcare prices offset increases in the cost of gasoline and rental accommodations.\nThe dollar fell the most since late March overnight against a basket of major currencies .DXY, while the Mexican peso MXN= and Brazilian real BRL= jumped more than 1 percent on the news.\nThe British pound GBP= hit a four-month low versus the greenback after the BoE held key borrowing costs. It was last at $1.3517, just above Thursday's trough of $1.3457 touched.\nThe recent slowing in price growth in major economies has boosted expectations that most central banks except the Fed will continue their massive bond-buying programmes to keep policy stimulatory.\n\u201cRisk appetite rose overnight with U.S. core inflation and unchanged Bank of England both signalling only gradual normalisation in interest rates,\u201d ANZ analysts said in a note.\n\u201cEquities liked the contained inflation/rates environment.\u201d\nOn Friday, the dollar index .DXY rose modestly while the euro EUR= was barely changed at $1.1915.
