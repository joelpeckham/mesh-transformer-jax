 "context": "The following article called 'Argentina Suspends WTO Complaint After Spain Ends Biofuels Curbs' was published on 2013-01-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nArgentina suspended a trade\ncomplaint against the European Union over Spanish biofuel curbs\nafter Spain dropped its plan.  The Spanish government issued a law in April last year\nrequiring that only EU fuel could meet quotas for biofuels used\nin transport. That prompted a World Trade Organization  challenge \nby Argentina, the world\u2019s largest exporter of soybean biodiesel,\nwhich said the plan was discriminatory and a violation of WTO\nrules. Spain said on Oct. 16 that it would abandon the order\nincorporating the EU\u2019s renewable energy law into national\nlegislation.  \u201cWe decided not to proceed with the case,\u201d Enrique\nFerrer, a diplomat in Argentina\u2019s mission in Geneva, said in a\ntelephone interview today. \u201cSpain\u2019s government issued a new\ndecree, so for the time being we are able to export biodiesel to\nSpain. We are still following it very closely to see if our\nexports don\u2019t have any problems in the market and then we won\u2019t\nproceed with the case.\u201d  The EU said its order was designed to protect the\nenvironment by increasing the use of renewable energy and to\ncontribute to the security of the energy supply. Argentina\u2019s\nForeign Ministry said the real intention was retaliation after\nPresident Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner\u2019s government seized a\n51 percent YPF SA stake from Spain\u2019s  Repsol SA (REP)  in April.  Spanish Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria said on April\n16, the same day YPF was nationalized, that his government would\ntake \u201cdecisive\u201d action against Argentina within days. The\nseizure of YPF could not be challenged under WTO rules.  Spanish Retreat  Marking a retreat from Soria\u2019s threat to retaliate with\n\u201cclear and decisive\u201d measures on trade, industry and energy,\nDeputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said on April\n20 that Spain would undermine demand for Argentine biodiesel by\noffering incentives to use Spanish and EU biodiesel.  Fernandez and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy are both\ndue to attend a summit of the EU and the Community of Latin\nAmerican and Caribbean States starting in Santiago tomorrow.  Relations between Argentina and its major trading partners\nhave soured under Fernandez\u2019s presidency and led to the Latin\nAmerican country\u2019s growing political and economic isolation.\nAlong with the EU, the U.S. and Japan have complained separately\nat the WTO about Argentina\u2019s import policies, saying they hinder\nforeign goods and discriminate between imported and domestic\nproducts.  \u201cThe measure in question foresees a procedure for\nallocation of biodiesels quantities among producers, and only\nbiodiesels from producers with an assigned quantity would count\ntowards meeting compulsory targets on the use of biofuels,\u201d\nJohn Clancy, a European Commission spokesman, said in an e-\nmailed reply to questions. \u201cAdditionally, in December, Spain\namended certain aspects of the ministerial order subject of the\ncomplaint.\u201d  The 27-nation EU is Argentina\u2019s second-biggest trading\npartner after Brazil. Argentina\u2019s $448 billion economy is South\nAmerica\u2019s largest, after Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:\nJennifer M.
