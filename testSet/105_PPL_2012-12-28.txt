 "context": "The following article called 'Nuclear Output Rampus Up for Fifth Day on Duke, PPL Units' was published on 2012-12-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNuclear-power production gained for\na  fifth day  in the U.S., led by boosts at  PPL Corp. (PPL)  and  Duke\nEnergy Corp. (DUK)  reactors in  Pennsylvania  and South Carolina.  Total production gained 0.5 percent to 91,492 megawatts, or\n90 percent of capacity, the  highest level  since Sept. 14,\naccording to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled by\nBloomberg. Output was  3.8 percent  less than a year ago with nine\nof 104 reactor offline.  PPL\u2019s Susquehanna 2, which can generate 1,140 megawatts,\noperated at 15 percent of capacity compared with 1 percent\nyesterday. The unit began supplying electricity to the grid\ntoday for the first time since it automatically shut Dec. 16\nduring a turbine valve test, according to a company statement.  \u201cAn unrelated issue with the positioning of a valve in one\nof the unit\u2019s main water pumps during startup activities\nextended the out-of-service time,\u201d PPL said. Susquehanna is\nabout 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Allentown.  The 1,129-megawatt Catawba 1 reactor owned by Duke returned\nto service today after completing a refueling outage that began\nin late November, Mary Kathryn Green, a company spokeswoman\nbased at the plant, said in an e-mail. The unit is about 17\nmiles southwest of  Charlotte ,  North Carolina .  Southeast Output  Output in the NRC\u2019s  Southeastern region , from Florida to\nVirginia, gained 1 percent to 27,837 megawatts, the biggest\nincrease in the U.S. The  Tennessee Valley Authority \u2019s 1,104-\nmegawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor contributed to the advance as it\noperated at 89 percent of capacity, up from 78 percent\nyesterday.  Generation increased by 0.7 percent to 23,930 megawatts in\nthe commission\u2019s Northeastern region covering Maryland to  Maine .\nThat\u2019s 4.1 percent higher than the  same day  a year ago as all\nreactors in the region were operating, according to NRC data\ncompiled by Bloomberg.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the\nU.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase\nconsumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The\naverage refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to\nthe  Nuclear Energy Institute .
