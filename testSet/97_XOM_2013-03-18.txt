 "context": "The following article called 'Statoil, BG Plan LNG Plant to Develop Tanzania Natural-Gas Finds' was published on 2013-03-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStatoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway \u2019s largest\nenergy producer, said a third \u201chigh-impact\u201d discovery in its\n Tanzania  offshore block added sufficient natural-gas volumes to\nsecure a joint development with BG Group\u2019s neighboring license.  Statoil will recommend a site in the second quarter for the\ncountry\u2019s first liquefied natural-gas plant with at least two\ntrains to handle production from its Block 2, where recoverable\nvolumes are now seen at 10 trillion to 13 trillion cubic feet,\nand BG-operated Block 1, the Stavanger-based company said today.  \u201cWe now have the gas we need to underpin a commercial\ndevelopment,\u201d Tim Dodson, executive vice-president for\nexploration, said in a phone interview from Stavanger. \u201cIt\u2019s\ngoing to be a huge project: Big offshore element, pipelines to\nland and a very large onshore development.\u201d  Statoil is expanding abroad to raise production to 2.5\nmillion barrels of oil equivalent a day from about 2 million\ntoday. The 67 percent state-owned company will this year drill\nas many as four more wells in Tanzania and  Mozambique , where\nexplorers including  Eni SpA (ENI)  have found more than 100 trillion\ncubic feet of gas, enough to meet global demand for a year.  The facility that Statoil and BG are considering would have\nat least twice the capacity of the Norwegian company\u2019s only LNG\nplant at Hammerfest in Arctic Northern Norway, Dodson said. That\nsite handles gas from the Snohvit field in the  Barents Sea  and\nproduces 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, he said.  Too Early  While it\u2019s too early to give a cost or exact timeline,\nTanzanian authorities\u2019 assessment last year that output could\nstart within seven years is \u201cnot unreasonable,\u201d Dodson said.  \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving this into the development phase very\nshortly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be both a costly and fairly\nlengthy development.\u201d The plans will be presented in the second\nquarter to the authorities, which have asked Statoil and BG to\nwork on a joint development of blocks 1 and 2, Dodson said.  Statoil is the operator of Block 2 with a 65 percent share,\nand  Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM)  has 35 percent. BG operates Block 1 with 60\npercent, while partner  Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR)  holds 40 percent.  Statoil said earlier it had made its fourth discovery in\nBlock 2 in a year, containing as much as 6 trillion cubic feet\nof gas. That was the third \u201chigh-impact\u201d find in the block,\ndefined as holding more than 250 million barrels of oil\nequivalent or 100 million barrels net to Statoil.  Jodari Field  BG estimates gross recoverable resources from its Tanzania\nBlocks 1, 3 and 4 at near 10 trillion cubic feet of gas \u201cwith\nextensive further potential to be explored\u201d and hasn\u2019t got a\nspecific figure for Block 1, spokesman  Mark Todd  said by e-mail.  A stem test on BG\u2019s Jodari field in Block 1 showed \u201cbetter\nthan expected reservoir qualities\u201d and reduced uncertainty as\nthe partners consider a potential LNG project, BG said today in\na separate statement. The company said last month plans for\nexports would proceed more slowly than planned because Tanzania\nlacks infrastructure and capacity to handle big investments.  \u201cWe have the gas now, and that\u2019s the most important\nthing,\u201d Dodson said. \u201cIt will still be quite demanding to do\nthis, given the fact that this will be the first development of\nits kind in Tanzania.\u201d  The new discovery, called Tangawizi-1, is worth a net 1.3\nkroner to 1.9 kroner a share for Statoil, Teodor Sveen Nilsen,\nan analyst at Swedbank First Securities who has a buy\nrecommendation on the company, said in a note to clients.  Statoil fell 0.4 percent to 140.4 kroner by 1:49 p.m. in\nOslo.  High-Impact Opportunities  Statoil will drill two to four more wells in east  Africa \nthis year and still sees opportunities for high-impact\ndiscoveries in Tanzania and Mozambique, Dodson said.  The \u201cDiscoverer Americas\u201d drillship sailing from the  Gulf\nof Mexico  is scheduled to arrive in the first week of April in\nMozambique, where it will search mainly for oil in Blocks 2 and\n5, Dodson said. \u201cThese are high-risk opportunities with the\npotential to be fairly large,\u201d he said.  The ship will then move north to Tanzania to test further\npotential in Block 2, where Statoil has identified \u201ctwo to\nthree other prospects\u201d described as \u201cquite sizeable,\u201d\nalthough not as big as the three high-impact finds already made,\nhe said. The company is interpreting new 3-D seismic material\nthat may show the presence of further prospects, he said.
