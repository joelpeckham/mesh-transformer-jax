The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world\u2019s\nbiggest defense contractor, is preparing to scour the Pacific\nOcean seabed in a search for metals using data obtained in a\ncold-war hunt for a sunken Soviet submarine.  Lockheed has set up a unit, U.K. Seabed Resources, to\nexplore for so-called polymetallic nodules that can contain\ncopper, nickel, cobalt, manganese and rare earths, it said in\nLondon today. The company, supported by the U.K. government, has\nbeen granted the first commercial exploration rights for a\n58,000 square-kilometer (22,000 square mile) area of the Pacific\nbetween Hawaii and  Mexico .  \u201cThis is about giving the U.K. access to strategically\nimportant minerals and it\u2019s about growing a nascent industry,\nthose are the primary motivators for us,\u201d Stephen Ball, chief\nexecutive officer of Lockheed Martin\u2019s U.K. unit and of Seabed\nResources, said in an interview.  Rare earths comprise 17 elements used in magnets, oil\nrefining and smartphone batteries. They became a political and\nlegislative flashpoint in July 2010 when China moved to limit\ndomestic output and slash export quotas by 40 percent, souring\nties with the U.S. and  Japan .  \u201cThe U.K. is leading the way in this exciting new\nindustry,\u201d Prime Minister David Cameron said at the event to\nannounce the new venture. The exploration \u201cis expected to be\nworth up to 40 billion pounds to the U.K. economy over the next\n30 years,\u201d the equivalent of $60 billion.  Sea Law  Seabed Resources was granted the license by the\nInternational Seabed Authority under the sponsorship of the\nBritish government at a cost of about $500,000, Ball said. The\ncompany is meeting with potential U.K. suppliers, he said.\nSeabed mining outside a nation\u2019s territorial waters is governed\nby the ISA, established under the United Nations Convention on\nthe Law of the Sea.  Exploration will start late in the U.K. summer this year\nand the company expects to be ready to seek an exploitation\nlicense in about three years and to start extraction in five to\nsix, Ball said.  Seabed Resources has applied for a second exploration\nlicense, with a decision due mid-year, he said.  Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed Martin surveyed the area\ntargeted for exploration in the 1970s and 1980s after being\nsubcontracted to search for a lost Soviet submarine by\nbillionaire industrialist, aviator and filmmaker Howard Hughes.  Company Heritage  \u201cWe had survey data as part of the heritage of our\ncompany,\u201d said Ball. \u201cWe have conducted surveys in the past of\nthat part of the ocean, so we understood what was there.\u201d  The polymetallic nodules Seabed Resources will look for are\nfound at a depth of about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles), are 3\ncentimeters to 5 centimeters in size and lie on top of the\nseabed, the company said. Rare earths, along with materials such\nas tungsten and niobium, are on a British Geological Survey\nsupply-risk list of materials needed to maintain the U.K.\u2019s\neconomy and lifestyle.  \u201cRare-earth metals are vital to many new innovations such\nas mobile phones and low carbon technologies,\u201d Universities and\nScience Minister David Willetts said in a statement. \u201cThe U.K.\nis well placed to lead this first exploration step which could\npave the way for us to be at the forefront of significant new\ncommercial, engineering and economic opportunities.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nThomas Biesheuvel in  London  at \n tbiesheuvel@bloomberg.net ;\nRobert Wall in London at \n rwall6@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nJohn Viljoen at \n jviljoen@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Lockheed Martin Corporation was 71.81148529052734 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Lockheed Martin Corporation was ",
