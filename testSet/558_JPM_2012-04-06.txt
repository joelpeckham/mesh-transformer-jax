 "context": "The following article called 'BlackRock Leads ETF Boom to Global Junk Rally: Credit Markets' was published on 2012-04-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe $28.4 billion  Blackrock Inc (BLK) .-led\nindustry of exchange-traded funds that buy U.S.  junk bonds  is\nexpanding into global speculative-grade debt as the notes\noutperform dollar-denominated securities by the most since 2009.  BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest money manager, opened the\nfirst ETFs on April 3 that will invest in junk bonds from Europe\nto  Asia  after its iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond Fund\nin the U.S. grew to more than $14 billion in less than five\nyears. Van Eck Global, the investment firm founded in 1955,\nopened its International High Yield Bond ETF the same day.  Fund managers are broadening their investments beyond  U.S.\ndebt  with yields on junk bonds outside the country almost double\nthe average of the past 10 years. Investors poured a record\n$31.1 billion into speculative-grade debt in the 14 weeks ended\nApril 2, according to EPFR Global data, and a three-month rally\nin dollar-denominated junk securities is now losing steam.  \u201cThere are many fixed-income managers today who are really\nreaching out to international and global issuers,\u201d Darek Wojnar, head of product development and management for\nBlackRock\u2019s iShares, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s one\nof the ways to diversify sources of yield.\u201d  High-yield bonds sold outside the U.S. returned 10.4\npercent in the first quarter, compared with a 5.1 percent gain\nfor junk notes in dollars, according to Bank of America Merrill\nLynch index data. That\u2019s the biggest three-month outperformance\nsince the period ended July 31, 2009, the data show.  Seek to Replicate  BlackRock\u2019s  IShares Global ex-USD High Yield Corporate Bond\nFund  and  IShares Emerging Markets High Yield Bond Fund (EMHY)  seek to\ninvest in bonds that replicate  indexes  composed of debt from\nboth developed and emerging countries outside the U.S. The U.S.\njunk-bond market is about five times the size of the comparable\nmarket in Europe, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show.  \u201cIt is not easy to create a diversified portfolio of\nEuropean high-yield names,\u201d said Jason Rosiak, head of\n portfolio management  at  Pacific Asset Management , the Newport\nBeach, California affiliate of Pacific Life Insurance Co., in an\ne-mail. The new ETFs \u201cwould create a more liquid vehicle for\ntotal return or high-yield investors to gain international\nexposure.\u201d  Elsewhere in credit markets, a benchmark gauge of U.S.\ncompany debt risk jumped by the most in almost four months amid\ninvestor concern that  Spain  may need international aid,\ndeepening Europe\u2019s fiscal crisis. Burger chain  Wendy\u2019s Co. (WEN)  set\nthe  interest rate  it will pay on a $1.125 billion loan to\nrefinance debt. Bon-Ton Stores Inc.\u2019s debentures fell the most\nin almost three months as the retailer said its March same-store\nsales dropped, missing analyst estimates.  Credit Swaps  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a\ncredit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge\nagainst losses on corporate debt or to speculate on\ncreditworthiness, climbed 4.4 basis points to a mid-price of 97\nbasis points as of 5:13 p.m. in  New York , according to Markit\nGroup Ltd. That\u2019s the biggest daily increase since Dec. 8, when\nthe measure surged 6 basis points.  In  London , the  Markit iTraxx Europe Index  of 125 companies\nwith investment-grade ratings rose 2.4 to 132.2. The Markit\niTraxx Japan index was little changed at 159.5 basis points as\nof 9:05 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG. The gauge\nclosed yesterday at 158.9, the highest level since March 23,\naccording to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles\nprices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  Deteriorating Confidence  The indexes typically rise as investor confidence\ndeteriorates and fall as it improves. Credit swaps pay the buyer\nface value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the\nvalue of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000\nannually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  Markets in  Australia ,  Hong Kong  and  Singapore  are closed\ntoday for a public holiday.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of\ndebt-market stress, rose 0.88 basis point to 29.19 basis points,\nthe highest level since Feb. 27. The gauge, which has climbed\nfrom an almost eight-month low on March 28, widens when\ninvestors seek the perceived safety of  government securities  and\nnarrows when they favor assets such as corporate bonds.  Bonds of Fairfield, Connecticut-based  General Electric Co. (GE) ,\nthe world\u2019s largest maker of jet engines, were the most actively\ntraded U.S. corporate securities by dealers yesterday, with 123\ntrades of $1 million or more, according to Trace, the bond-price\nreporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Bon-Ton Bonds  Bon-Ton\u2019s $480 million of 10.25 percent notes due March\n2014 fell 2.25 cents to 85.75 cents on the dollar to yield 19.4\npercent, Trace data show. That\u2019s the biggest drop since Jan. 13.  Comparable-store sales for the five weeks ended March 31\nfell 0.1 percent to $254.1 million, compared with $254.5 million\nin the same period last year, York, Pennsylvania-based Bon-Ton\nsaid yesterday in a statement. The figure came in below the 1.7\npercent average projection from analysts surveyed by researcher\nRetail Metrics Inc.  The  Standard & Poor\u2019s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index \nfell for the first time in four days to a more than three-week\nlow, declining 0.05 cent to 93.6 cents on the dollar. The\nmeasure, which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-\nlien leveraged loans, has returned 4.3 percent this year.  Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3\nby Moody\u2019s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by S&P.  Wendy\u2019s Loan  Wendy\u2019s, the second-largest U.S. hamburger chain, is\nseeking its term loan B to refinance debt, according to a person\nwith knowledge of the transaction. The Dublin, Ohio-based fast\nfood company\u2019s debt, due in seven years, will pay 3.5 percentage\npoints to 3.75 percentage points more than the London interbank\noffered rate, said the person, who declined to be identified\nbecause the terms are private.  Libor, a rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from\neach other that acts as a benchmark for about $360 trillion of\nfinancial instruments worldwide, will have a 1.25 percent floor.\nWendy\u2019s is proposing to sell the loan at 99 cents on the dollar,\nthe person said, reducing proceeds for the company and boosting\nthe yield to investors.  In  emerging markets , relative yields rose for a second day,\nclimbing 5 basis points to 346 basis points, or 3.46 percentage\npoints, according to  JPMorgan Chase & Co.\u2019s EMBI Global index .\nThe guage has averaged 376 basis points this year.  With the  Federal Reserve  saying economic conditions will\nprobably warrant interest rates remaining near zero through at\nleast 2014, ETFs are gaining in popularity with individuals\nseeking higher-yielding investments. European speculative-grade\ndebt is yielding an average of 8.4 percent, versus a 7.3 percent\nyield on comparable debt in the U.S., Bank of America Merrill\nLynch index data show.  ETF Scrutiny  \u201cThere\u2019s a growing universe of high-yield debt globally,\u201d\nsaid Francis Rodilosso, an investment manager at Van Eck\nAssociates Corp. \u201cWith the advances of the ETFs and more people\ngetting exposure to high-yield debt, it made sense to create an\nalternative way for people to seek higher-yielding assets.\u201d  ETFs, which drew congressional scrutiny last year as more\ncomplex and riskier versions emerged, allow individual investors\nto speculate on debt ranked below investment grade without\nowning the bonds. Unlike mutual funds, which have shares that\nare priced once a day, ETFs are listed on exchanges and bought\nand sold like stocks.  Market Vectors\u2019s International High Yield Bond Fund ETF\nwill track an index of speculative-grade debt sold by companies\nthroughout the world, including emerging markets, according to a\nprospectus filed on March 29.  Fund Inflows  High-yield bond ETFs recorded $6.9 billion of U.S. inflows\nduring the first three months, compared with $1.9 billion of\ninflows in the comparable period in 2011, according to data\ncompiled by London-based ETF Global Insight. Global inflows have\ntotaled $7.9 billion so far this year, the data show.  Yields on U.S. high-yield bonds are within 0.5 percentage\npoint of the record low of 7.19 percent reached in May 2011,\nBank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The debt has lost\n0.1 percent since the end of February amid concern that  Europe \u2019s\ndebt crisis may be escalating.  BlackRock\u2019s global junk-bond ETF aims to invest at least 40\npercent of its assets in companies located or doing business\noutside the U.S., according to a prospectus filed on March 29.  The fund which won\u2019t try to beat the index it tracks or\nposition itself defensively when markets decline or appear\novervalued, will charge a management fee of 0.55 percent and be\noverseen by James Mauro and Scott Radell, the document said.  More Volatile  While passive management \u201cmay eliminate the chance that\nthe fund will substantially outperform the underlying index,\u201d\nit \u201cmay reduce some risks of active management, such as poor\nsecurity selection,\u201d according to the prospectus.  \u201cThe passive approach is what many of our clients seek,\u201d\nWojnar said. \u201cWe always start by asking, what is the client\u2019s\nproblem that we\u2019re trying to solve.\u201d  Investors in ETFs are often seeking the ability to sell\nquickly, making them more volatile compared with traditional\nbuyers of corporate debt, such as pension plans and insurance\ncompanies, Rosiak said.  The key to the new funds\u2019 success \u201cwill be portfolio\ndiversification and construction in a market that has\nhistorically has less liquidity than the domestic arena,\u201d he\nsaid.
