 "context": "The following article called 'Obama Jokes of \u2019Rookie\u2019 White House While Hard Days Noted' was published on 2013-04-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPresident  Barack Obama , addressing an audience of Washington journalists and Hollywood celebrities at a ritual annual dinner, spared no jokes about himself.  \u201cThese days, I look in the mirror and I have to admit, I\u2019m not the strapping young Muslim socialist that I used to be,\u201d the president said at last night\u2019s black-tie dinner of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association. \u201cTime passes. You get a little gray.\u201d  The president, appearing before almost 3,000 people assembled for an annual dinner that attracts the capital\u2019s leaders as well as stars of cinema and television, was ready with jokes about his recent reference to  California \u2019s attorney general,  Kamala Harris , as the nation\u2019s best-looking.  \u201cEven after all this time, I still make rookie mistakes,\u201d Obama said. \u201cLike, I\u2019m out in California, we\u2019re at a fundraiser, we\u2019re having a nice time. I happen to mention that Kamala Harris is the best-looking attorney general in the country. As you might imagine, I got in trouble when I got back home. Who knew Eric Holder was so sensitive?\u201d -- he said, alluding to his own attorney general, as opposed to his wife.  At this dinner in which the president traditionally shares a stage with a television comedian, Obama served as the first act to humorist  Conan O\u2019Brien , serving up lines about not only himself but also congressional leaders as well. And both Obama and O\u2019Brien dished out jokes about the media for an audience of actors including  Barbra Streisand  and  Kevin Spacey .  Press Corps  \u201cOf course, the White House press corps is here,\u201d Obama said in his appearance at the Washington Hilton Hotel. \u201cI know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of a story, just in case one of them happens to be accurate.\u201d  \u201cThe fact is I really do respect the press,\u201d the president said. \u201cI recognize that the press and I have different jobs to do. My job is to be president; your job is to keep me humble. Frankly, I think I\u2019m doing my job better.\u201d  The president shared some jokes about the 2012 election contest in which he defeated Republican  Mitt Romney , whose campaign benefited financially from the supporting super-PAC donations of  Sheldon Adelson , chairman and CEO of  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  and one of the world\u2019s richest men.  \u2018Nobama Island\u2019  \u201cDid you know that Sheldon Adelson spent $100 million of his own money last year on negative ads?\u201d Obama asked his audience last night. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to really dislike me to spend that kind of money. I mean, that\u2019s Oprah money. You could buy an island and call it \u2018Nobama\u2019 for that kind of money.\u201d  \u201cSheldon would have been better off offering me $100 million to drop out of the race,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have taken it, but I\u2019d have thought about it.\u201d  His wife, Michelle, the president added, \u201c would have taken it -- You think I\u2019m joking? \u201d  The president joked about the problems he has been having dealing with Republicans in Congress, naming Senate Republican Leader  Mitch McConnell  of  Kentucky .  \u201cEven after I\u2019ve done all this, some folks still don\u2019t think I spend enough time with Congress,\u201d Obama said. \u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell?\u2019 they ask,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell? I\u2019m sorry. I get frustrated sometimes.\u201d  The president insisted that he is \u201cnot giving up.\u201d In fact, he said, he is taking his \u201ccharm offensive on the road\u201d as he named some of the  Tea Party \u2019s favorite Republicans. He is planning a barbeque with  Texas  Senator  Ted Cruz , he joked, a bluegrass concert with Senator  Rand Paul  of Kentucky, and \u201ca book-burning\u201d with Representative  Michele Bachmann  of  Minnesota .  \u201cMy charm offensive has helped me learn some interesting things about what\u2019s going on in Congress -- it turns out, absolutely nothing,\u201d he said.  Citizenship  The president did not leave the stage without poking fun at opponents who contend that he was not born in the U.S. Noting that he had attended the dedication for former President  George W. Bush \u2019s presidential library in Texas last week, he said: \u201cI\u2019m also hard at work on plans for the Obama Library. And some have suggested that we put it in my birthplace, but I\u2019d rather keep it in the  United States .\u201d  The president closed on a serious note at this dinner, citing the April 15 bombing of the  Boston  Marathon that claimed three lives and injured more than 260 people.  Serious Side  \u201cThese have been some very hard days for too many of our citizens,\u201d Obama said. \u201cEven as we gather here tonight, our thoughts are not far from the people of Boston and the people of West, Texas. There are families in the Midwest who are coping with some terrible floods.\u201d  \u201cBut even when the days seemed darkest, we have seen humanity shine at its brightest,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd so, those of us in this room tonight, we are incredibly lucky,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd the fact is, we can do better -- all of us. Those of us in public office, those of us in the press, those who produce entertainment for our kids, those with power, those with influence -- all of us, including myself, we can strive to value those things that I suspect led most of us to do the work that we do in the first place -- because we believed in something that was true, and we believed in service, and the idea that we can have a lasting, positive impact on the lives of the people around us.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: Mark Silva in Washington at  msilva34@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jeanne Cummings at  jcummings21@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Las Vegas Sands Corp. was 40.9825325012207 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Las Vegas Sands Corp. was ",
