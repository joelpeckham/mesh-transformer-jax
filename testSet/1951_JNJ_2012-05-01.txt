 "context": "The following article called 'Pfizer Pipeline Bet to Show If Drugmaker Has Blockbuster' was published on 2012-05-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPfizer Inc. (PFE) \u2019s Chief Executive Officer\n Ian Read  will find out in the next six months whether his plan\nto shed units and focus on new drugs will pay off, with three\ntop products awaiting approval or key data.  U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulators will rule on\nPfizer\u2019s blood thinner and arthritis pill by June and August,\nrespectively. The New York-based company plans to report data\nfrom the last of three phases of clinical tests on bapineuzumab,\nits experimental Alzheimer\u2019s treatment, in the third quarter.  In the meantime, Read is buying back shares, arguing that\nPfizer\u2019s best investment of cash is the drugmaker\u2019s stock.\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a discontinuity between what the street sees\nand puts in our share price for our pipeline, and what we can\nsee in our pipeline,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Frank D\u2019Amelio\nsaid today in a telephone interview.  Pfizer is trying to move past its dependence on Lipitor,\nthe best-selling cholesterol pill that lost marketing\nexclusivity last November. Investors are awaiting more clarity\non how Read will divest the company\u2019s animal health unit,\nscheduled to be announced by July. The world\u2019s biggest drugmaker\nsaid last month it would sell its infant nutrition unit to\nVevey, Switzerland-based  Nestle SA (NESN)  for $11.9 billion.  Read also is reorganizing the company\u2019s brand-name drug\nbusiness to separate it from what Pfizer calls the \u201cestablished\nproducts\u201d line, including medicines that have gone off-patent\nas well as  emerging markets  sales.  \u2018Get a Feel\u2019  \u201cI\u2019ve got to get a feel for how the two business units\nlook and feel and run,\u201d Read said today in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get a feel for how the innovative core\nstrengthens its pipeline.\u201d  Read said he hasn\u2019t yet considered splitting brand-name and\nestablished products into different companies. \u201cIt\u2019s far too\npremature to talk about the businesses being separate.\u201d  Tony Butler , an analyst with  Barclays Capital  in  New York ,\nsaid he doesn\u2019t forecast an increase in revenue for Pfizer from\nnow until 2020.  \u201cWhat you\u2019re left with after the divestiture is a\npharmaceutical business that will be smaller, but has a number\nof challenges from a growth perspective,\u201d Butler said today in\nan interview with Bloomberg TV. \u201cNew products drive revenue\nchange, and while Pfizer does have some, they\u2019re not enough.\u201d  Profit Falls  Earlier today, the New York-based company reported first-\nquarter profit fell 19 percent after revenue from Lipitor\ndeclined because of generic competition. The company trimmed its\n2012 forecast after the sale of the nutritional unit.  Net income dropped to $1.79 billion, or 24 cents a share,\nfrom $2.2 billion, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Earnings\nexcluding one-time items beat by 2 cents the 56-cent average of\n19 analysts  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $22.78 at the close\nin New York. The shares have gained 8.6 percent in the past 12\nmonths.  Pfizer plans to release data on its Alzheimer\u2019s treatment,\nbapineuzumab, in the third quarter of this year, Olivier Brandicourt, president of primary care, said today on a\nconference call discussing the earnings.  Pfizer,  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  and  Elan Corp. (ELN)  are partners on\nthe Alzheimer\u2019s drug. One of the two studies Pfizer is\nconducting has finished, and another will be done in several\nmonths, Brandicourt said. And on May 9, a panel advising the FDA\nwill make recommendations on tofacitinib, Pfizer\u2019s experimental\npill to treat arthritis.  No Surprises  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing they\u2019ve done that\u2019s been shocking or\nconcerning to us,\u201d Geno Germano, Pfizer\u2019s president of\nspecialty care, said of the regulators\u2019 review. The FDA is\nscheduled to rule on tofacitinib by Aug. 20, and the drug if\napproved may be worth $1.5 billion to Pfizer this year, John Boris, an analyst for Citigroup, said in a note to clients.  Eliquis, a blood thinner developed with Bristol-Myers\nSquibb Co., will get an FDA decision by the end of June. The\ndrugmakers will split sales from the pill, which  Tim Anderson ,\nan analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York,\nestimates at $2.5 billion annually by 2015.  Pfizer said full-year profit will be $1.23 to $1.38 a\nshare, compared with a previous  forecast  for as much as $1.52.\nThe change was from sale of company\u2019s the nutrition unit, the\ndrugmaker said.  Revenue Decline  Revenue fell to $15.4 billion from $16.5 billion a year\nearlier, hurt by a 25 percent drop in sales from its\n pharmaceutical business  because of the loss of Lipitor\u2019s U.S.\npatent protection. The sales decline was made up for with a 7\npercent cut to costs, excluding the impact of foreign exchange,\npart of Read\u2019s plan to make the company more efficient.  Pfizer also said that it took a $450 million charge after\nagreeing to settle a lawsuit with  Brigham Young University  over\ncredit for development of the arthritis painkiller Celebrex.  Sales of Lipitor, still Pfizer\u2019s best-selling drug, fell 42\npercent to $1.4 billion. Those declines were led by a 71 percent\nfall in the U.S., after the cholesterol pill lost patent\nexclusivity in November.  Read said last week that Pfizer is deciding how it will\nshed the animal health unit, which makes drugs for pets and\nlivestock and had sales of $4.18 billion last year. The\ndrugmaker is likely to divest the unit in a combined initial\npublic offering and share swap, he said, in which Pfizer would\nsell some stock on the open market and exchange a portion of\nPfizer shares for stock in the new company.
