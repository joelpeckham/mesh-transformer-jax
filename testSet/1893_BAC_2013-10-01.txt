The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMacquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia \u2019s\nlargest investment bank, bid for  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) \u2019s\nAustralian assets, said a person with knowledge of the matter,\nwho asked not to be named as the process is confidential.  A consortium led by Pepper Australia Pty, a non-bank\nlender, also made a bid, another person said. Final binding\noffers for the close to A$9 billion ($8.4 billion) in assets\nwere due yesterday, people with knowledge of the transaction\nsaid last month. The sale includes Lloyds\u2019s Capital Finance unit\nand corporate loans valued at more than A$2 billion, they said.  Lloyds Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio, 49, is\nstrengthening the firm\u2019s balance sheet by selling assets and\ncutting costs following the bank\u2019s 20 billion-pound ($32\nbillion) bailout in 2008. The British government last month\nstarted selling its 39 percent stake in the country\u2019s largest\nmortgage lender as part of a move to full private ownership.  \u201cFor the last three or four years Macquarie has been\nlooking to build its leasing portfolio,\u201d said  Angus Gluskie ,\nwho helps oversee about A$500 million in assets, including\nMacquarie shares, as chief investment officer at White Funds\nManagement Pty in Sydney. \u201cIt is an area that has given them\ngood returns.\u201d  Lisa Jamieson, a Sydney-based spokeswoman for Macquarie,\ndeclined to comment, as did Lynne Machin, a Lloyds spokeswoman.\n Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is advising Lloyds on the sale.  Earnings Volatility  Shares of Macquarie rose 0.2 percent to A$47.99 at the\nclose of Sydney trading and have jumped 35 percent this year,\ncompared with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index\u2019s 12 percent gain.  Chief Executive Officer  Nicholas Moore  has expanded\nMacquarie\u2019s annuity-style businesses such as lending, leasing\nand fund management to offset earnings volatility at its trading\nand investment banking units.  It bought a A$1 billion car loan portfolio from the\nAustralian unit of GMAC Inc. and a 53-aircraft leasing portfolio\nfrom International Lease Finance Corp. for A$2 billion in April\n2010. Its corporate and asset finance division had A$22.4\nbillion of loans and assets under management as of March 31,\naccording to a  company filing .  Competing Bids  Initial offers valued Lloyds\u2019s commercial-lending and\nasset-finance units in Australia at more than A$1 billion, the\nWall Street Journal reported on Sept. 25.  Pepper Australia\u2019s bid is being backed by  Bank of America\nCorp. (BAC)  and General Electric Co., the person said. Reuters\nreported the consortium\u2019s offer earlier today. Pepper declined\nto comment, according to a statement e-mailed by Anna Frilingos,\nan external communications adviser at DEC Public Relations.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  was preparing a final bid for the\nassets, two people with knowledge of the matter said last week.\n Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  dropped out of the\nrace, people said. Westpac\u2019s Sydney-based spokeswoman Supreet\nThomas declined to comment.
