 "context": "The following article called 'Alstom Chief Prepares Savings Blueprint to Counter Lower Orders' was published on 2013-09-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAlstom SA (SU) , a French maker of power\nequipment and trains, is working on a plan to cut costs that\nincludes curbs on travel expenses as orders slump.  \u201cIt\u2019s a savings plan throughout the entire group which\nregards general expenditure such as travel, large-group\nmeetings, missions,\u201d Isabelle Tourancheau, a spokeswoman for\nthe company, told Bloomberg today. She declined to say whether\nthe plan will include job losses.  Chief Executive Officer Patrick Kron in May slashed his\nforecast for sales and margins, citing a slowdown in the global\neconomy. Alstom cut  jobs  in Europe and the U.S. as utilities\u2019\ndemand for power equipment slumped. The company plans to shut\nsome plants that make windmills and power-grid gear, while\nexpanding production lines for trains and turbines in countries\nsuch as  China ,  Russia ,  Brazil  and  India  to tap local demand.  Orders in the three months through June were below sales\nfor the first time in 11 quarters, dropping 32 percent to 4.07\nbillion euros ($5.4 billion) as utilities and railways in\nEurope,  Africa  and the Middle East slashed spending. Sales at\nAlstom, based in the Paris suburb of Levallois-Perret, fell 4\npercent to 4.58 billion euros.  Savings Blueprint  The savings plan will be presented to Alstom\u2019s board on\nOct. 1, Tourancheau said.  Kron has sent a letter to management saying that the\ncompany will \u201cvery soon\u201d outline \u201cswift and decisive actions,\neven if they are painful,\u201d to strengthen the company, Le\nJournal du Dimanche reported yesterday. The purge will affect\ntravel, seminars, hiring, training, consultants and sub-contractors, the newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Heads of manufacturing sites have been told in a July 24\nmessage to cut back on travel and make other savings, Patrick\nMaillot, a CFDT union representative, told Bloomberg in an\ninterview today. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re poised to fire\u201d as the\nbacklog represents three years of sales at the transport unit.  In 2010, Kron announced 4,000 job cuts at sites that make\ncoal- and gas-fired power equipment in Europe and the U.S. A\nyear later, he followed with plants to cut a further 1,380\npositions at its transport unit in Europe.  Bouygues Stake  The French company ranks behind  General Electric Co. (GE)  and\nMunich-based Siemens AG in the power-equipment industry. It also\ncompetes with Siemens and Montreal-based  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  on\ntrain and metro cars, and with Siemens and  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  in power-transmission markets.  The Alstom CEO, who had predicted sales would rise by more\nthan 5 percent in the three years through March 2015, cut his\nforecast in May, predicting that revenue will \u201cgrow organically\nat a low single-digit\u201d rate with margins little changed this\nyear. He also increased his estimate for restructuring charges\nto 100 million euros to 150 million euros.  Bouygues SA, which has a 29 percent stake in Alstom, has\nthreatened to exit its investment during negotiations with the\ngovernment over phone licenses, Le Journal du Dimanche reported,\nwithout citing anyone. A Bouygues official declined to comment\non the report.  Alstom shares rose 1.3 percent to 27 euros at 10:53 a.m. in\nParis today. They are down 10 percent this year, while the CAC40\nindex has risen 9.9 percent.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut Alstom\u2019s long-term  credit\nrating  by one level in June to Baa3, the lowest investment\ngrade.
