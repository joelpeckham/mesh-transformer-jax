 "context": "The following article called 'Obama Momentum Slowed by Jobs Report That May Spur Stimulus' was published on 2012-09-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nPresident  Barack Obama , a day after getting his highest approval rating in more than a year, was confronted by a worse-than-expected slowdown in the job market that threatened to undercut enthusiasm for his re-election.  About 12 hours after Obama took the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, to accept the party\u2019s nomination for a second term as president, Republican nominee  Mitt Romney  seized on the labor data, underlining the challenge the economy presents for the administration.  \u201cThe timing couldn\u2019t be worse for the president in terms of coming out of a really good convention with some momentum,\u201d said Stu Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report in Washington. \u201cThis just steps on that bounce, and I think it\u2019s a big problem for the Democrats.\u201d  Yesterday\u2019s U.S. Labor Department report drove the political debate as both candidates campaigned in the swing states of  Iowa  and  New Hampshire . The figures showed the economy added 96,000 jobs in August, down from a revised gain of 141,000 in July and fewer than forecast. While the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent from 8.3 percent in July, the report showed 368,000 Americans left the job market and the share of the working-age population in the  labor force  slumped to 63.5 percent, the lowest since 1981.  Fed Speculation  The numbers also sparked renewed speculation about additional stimulus from the  Federal Reserve , which holds its next meeting Sept. 12-13.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said in an Aug. 31 speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that the stalled labor market is \u201ca grave concern\u201d and threatens to \u201cwreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years.\u201d  The central bank chief said stimulus options include extending the Fed\u2019s pledge to hold the main interest rate near zero through at least late 2014 and buying bonds in a third round of so-called quantitative easing to reduce  interest rates .  Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren  and three other regional bank presidents have called for an \u201copen-ended\u201d approach to bond buying, in which the central bank would announce an amount of monthly purchases that would continue until the economy sufficiently improves.  Labor Data  Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, California, said  job creation  averaging less than 100,000 over the last three months, no growth in average hourly earnings, a decline in labor force participation and rising teenage unemployment probably will prompt the Fed to act.  \u201cPut all that together and it triggers the need for a policy response,\u201d El-Erian said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Stocks advanced yesterday with the  Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index (SPX)  rising 0.4 percent to 1,437.92, its highest level since January 2008, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  closed at its highest since December 2007 amid bets the labor data will spur the Fed to act.  In Iowa yesterday, Romney said he didn\u2019t believe that more steps by the Fed would have much impact. He called the Fed\u2019s last round of monetary easing \u201cless effective than we had hoped,\u201d and suggested Obama is relying on the central bank to spur an economic recovery his policies have failed to create.  Final Drive  The jobs numbers were released at a pivotal point in the 2012 presidential campaign, with both party conventions finished and the two candidates embarking on a two-month drive to persuade voters before the Nov. 6 election.  Jobs and the economy are the core issues in the race, and they remain a burden for Obama. The  unemployment rate  has exceeded 8 percent since February 2009, the longest stretch in monthly records going back to 1948, and economic growth this year is below normal for the post-World War II era.  \u201cWe know it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Obama said of the payrolls figure at a campaign stop in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. \u201cWe need to create more jobs faster.\u201d  Even the potentially positive news from the jobs report -- the unexpected decrease of the jobless rate -- was more problematic than positive, according to economists. While the unemployment rate came down, \u201cit fell for the wrong reason,\u201d Maury N. Harris, chief economist for UBS Securities LLC, said today in a client note.  \u201cI was, candidly, startled by how much the labor force declined,\u201d said Matt McDonald, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies in Washington who is advising the Romney campaign.  Job Growth  While the unemployment rate is typically the most closely watched by voters, that may be overshadowed by the lackluster growth in jobs, according to Rothenberg.  \u201cThe numbers do provide a mixed message with the unemployment rate down and the new jobs numbers very mediocre, rather disappointing, but the bottom line is a net negative certainly for the president and the White House,\u201d Rothenberg said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can come to any other conclusion other than the economy continues to be disappointing.\u201d  Across-the-board spending cuts that will be enacted unless Obama and Congress agree to a deficit-reduction plan will worsen the economy, said  Niall Ferguson , a Harvard University history professor, according to a transcript of  CNN \u2019s \u201cFareed Zakaria GPS,\u201d which will air tomorrow.  Political Gridlock  While an agreement is possible, \u201cthe more likely scenario is actually a double-dip\u201d recession in 2013 because of a failure to overcome the political gridlock, Ferguson said.  \u201cThe most noteworthy thing about the U.S. recovery so far has been how weak it is,\u201d  Roger Altman , a private equity investor who was U.S. Deputy Secretary of Treasury under Democratic President  Bill Clinton , said on the CNN show. He said deficit-reduction compromise next year might help spur an economic boom \u201cthree to four years\u201d from now.  The jobs report coincided with Gallup\u2019s latest poll showing the Democratic convention may have boosted Obama\u2019s fortunes. His job approval reached 52 percent, a 15-month high, and he was favored by 48 percent of registered voters to Romney\u2019s 45 percent. The daily tracking polls ended Sept. 6, the last day of the convention and before the jobs figures were released. The margin of error for both is plus or minus 3 percentage points.  Convention Boost  White House adviser  David Plouffe , traveling with Obama yesterday, said the convention gave the president a boost.  \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the race is going to change significantly,\u201d Plouffe said. \u201cBut we think that we come out of here with some momentum in terms of putting together the electoral picture.\u201d  Plouffe said the campaign would assess where it stands at the end of next week, \u201cbut our suspicion is the race is going to be about where it was.\u201d  The jobs figures may create difficulties for the Obama campaign as the media spends the weekend assessing the impact of two weeks of political conventions, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor and the director of the Annenberg Public Policy center at the  University of Pennsylvania .  \u201cYou\u2019ve got at least two more days of writing about the convention, so if the take on this is \u2018impact of great convention dampened by bad news on economy,\u2019 you\u2019ve got potentially three days of those bad headlines,\u201d Jamieson said.  Clear Choice  Romney sought to capitalize on the news. Arriving in Iowa yesterday for a midday campaign rally in Orange City, Romney said the figures highlight the \u201cclear choice\u201d voters have in the election.  \u201cThere\u2019s almost nothing the president has done in the last three and a half, four years that gives the American people confidence he knows what he\u2019s doing when it comes to jobs and the economy,\u201d Romney told reporters in Sioux City, where his campaign plane landed.  Obama only touched on the Labor Department report at a rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.  \u201cToday we learned that after losing around 800,000 jobs a month when I took office, business once again added jobs for the 30th month in a row,\u201d he said.  It has taken the U.S. three years to recover about half of the 8.8 million jobs lost as a result of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  Obama focused his remarks on criticism of Romney and the Republicans, who he said are offering \u201cthe same prescriptions that they\u2019ve had for the last 30 years -- tax cuts, tax cuts, gut some regulations, oh, and more tax cuts.\u201d  Both candidates made a play for swing states yesterday. Iowa and New Hampshire combined have 10 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency, and the attention being paid by the campaigns indicates how close they expect the election will be.
