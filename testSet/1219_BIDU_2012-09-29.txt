Chief Executive Officer\nRobin Li said  China \u2019s biggest Internet companies haven\u2019t yet\nfigured out the best way to make money from mobile, and he\u2019s\npatiently experimenting with business models.  About 25 percent of  Baidu\u2019s (BIDU)  research and development\nspending is on mobile, even as smartphones make up less than 10\npercent of the company\u2019s total sales, Li said yesterday at the\nChina 2.0 conference at  Stanford University . Mobile sales at\nleast tripled this year as Baidu rolled out products, he said.  \u201cExactly when it will become a material source I don\u2019t\nknow,\u201d Li said in his keynote address. \u201cI\u2019m in no hurry to\nfigure that out because we know there\u2019s lots of room for\nimprovement\u201d in mobile advertisements, he said.  Baidu, owner of China\u2019s most-used search engine, introduced\na mobile browser earlier this month for devices running Google\nInc.\u2019s Android operating system, as part of Li\u2019s effort to\nbecome the front door to the Web for smartphone users. Mobile-ad\nsales in China more than doubled to 2.4 billion  yuan  ($380\nmillion) last year, according to research company iResearch.  Beijing-based Baidu said in July that it\u2019s offering search\non Sina Corp.\u2019s mobile Web portal. That came after it agreed to\noffer search results of posts by users on Sina Weibo, a\nmicroblogging service similar to Twitter Inc. The company has\nalso introduced potential money-making services like cloud\nstorage.  Still, Li said that while he\u2019s optimistic about the future\nof the mobile Web, the money currently being generated doesn\u2019t\nyet match the hype.  \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to find the right business\nmodel for the mobile Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know users love\nthe mobile Internet and we have to go with them and we have to\ndevelop things they want.\u201d  Baidu  rose  2 percent to $116.89 in  New York  trading\nyesterday, leaving it little changed this year.
