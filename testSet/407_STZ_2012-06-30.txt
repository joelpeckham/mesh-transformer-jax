 "context": "The following article called 'Constellation Said to Be Key to Cementing AB InBev Deal' was published on 2012-06-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAnheuser-Busch InBev AB (ABI) \u2019s $20.1\nbillion deal for control of Corona beer brewer  Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC) \nhinged on a different beverage maker entirely: wine producer\n Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ)   The brewers, getting closer to an agreement after years of\nlegal squabbling, asked Constellation less than a month ago\nwhether it would buy out the rest of a distribution venture with\nModelo, said people familiar with the discussions who asked not\nto be identified as talks were private. They reasoned that\nletting go of the venture would make their transaction more\npalatable to U.S. regulators, the people said.  That paved the way for Constellation\u2019s $1.85 billion buyout\nyesterday, giving the world\u2019s largest wine maker sole U.S.\ndistribution of Corona Extra, the top-selling beer import in the\ncountry. AB InBev and  Mexico  City-based Modelo were motivated to\nbe flexible with Constellation and cut a deal quickly to get the\nlarger transaction completed, said two of these people.  The discussions with Constellation began several weeks ago,\nsaid Chief Executive Officer Rob Sands. The negotiation centered\non one scenario: A buyout of the Crown Imports LLC joint venture\nby Constellation.  \u201cThere was never any discussion or thought to my knowledge\nabout them buying out our side,\u201d Sands said in an interview.\n\u201cThis is clearly a structure that is the most positive from the\nantitrust perspective.\u201d  Constellation shareholders benefited too. The Victor, New\nYork-based company\u2019s shares jumped 24 percent to a five-year\nhigh of $27.06 at the close yesterday, the biggest percentage\ngain in at least 26 years.  Antitrust Concerns  AB InBev, which controls 18 percent of the global beer\nmarket, and Modelo actively sought advice on the potential\nantitrust ramifications ahead of a deal to avoid fallout,\naccording to people with knowledge of the matter. In most\ntransactions with antitrust risk, companies wait until after the\ndeal is announced to explore asset sales or divestitures aimed\nat appeasing regulators.  The beermakers wanted to avoid antitrust doubt given the\nsize of the transaction, the amount of money being borrowed and\nthe board members who agreed to step down following the\nannouncement, said the people.  AB InBev\u2019s managers have experience judging antitrust\nconcerns. In InBev NV\u2019s $52 billion takeover of Budweiser maker\nAnheuser Busch Cos. in 2008, the largest brewing deal in\nhistory, the new entity had to sell Labatt\u2019s operations in the\nU.S. to soothe regulators.  Steve Lipin, a spokesman for AB InBev, didn\u2019t respond to a\ncall and an e-mail seeking comment.  \u2018Better Communication\u2019  AB InBev, based in Leuven,  Belgium , and Modelo, Mexico\u2019s\nlargest brewer, have been in sporadic talks for more than a year\non a combination, people said. Modelo\u2019s controlling board\nmembers became more open to a combination after the Mexican\nbrewer lost an arbitration bid to deny board seats to some AB\nInBev directors in July 2010, according to the people.  Discussions became more urgent at the beginning of the\nyear, leading to meetings between the main shareholders of both\ncompanies in New York and Mexico City.  \u201cA better communication developed between our executive\nteams and our boards, which we hadn\u2019t been able to do before,\u201d\nModelo Chief Executive Officer Carlos Fernandez, a member of one\nof the families that control Modelo, said yesterday. \u201cThe\nrelationship grew.\u201d  Members of Modelo\u2019s management team also viewed a deal more\npositively after a possible bid for Foster\u2019s Group was rejected\nby some members of the group of controlling shareholders,\naccording to a person familiar with the matter. Modelo had\nmulled a bid for the Australian brewer, later taken over by\n SABMiller Plc (SAB)  for about A$10 billion ($10.2 billion), a person\nwith knowledge of the matter said in June last year.  All Cash  Fernandez yesterday declined to comment on Foster\u2019s, saying\nthe board was \u201calways analyzing different options.\u201d  Modelo Vice Chairman Maria Asuncion Aramburuzabala and Vice\nPresident Valentin Diez Morodo, lent their support to the AB\nInBev combination, people said. These two and others insisted it\nbe an all-cash offer with a high premium, said one of these\npeople.  That became more doable for AB InBev after the brewer of\nBudweiser paid down debt from the Anheuser deal, said another\nperson familiar with the matter. Although the company was\ninterested in the deal before Modelo was, it would have balked\nat an all-cash offer until the last few months as financing\nmarkets got friendlier for investment-grade borrowers, said this\nperson.  Improved Results  AB InBev will name Aramburuzabala and Diez Morodo to its\nboard after the transaction closes, a person with knowledge of\nthe matter said yesterday. The two new board members have\ncommitted to invest $1.5 billion of the proceeds from selling\ntheir Modelo shares into AB InBev shares, which will be\ndelivered within five years via a deferred share instrument,\naccording to a statement from AB InBev and Modelo yesterday.  As deal talks progressed, Modelo improved its results,\nreporting a 1.2 percent gain in first-quarter domestic volumes\nwhile boosting prices 7.2 percent.  Export sales, which accounted for 38 percent of the total,\nrose 3.2 percent in dollar terms. About 80 percent of the\ncompany\u2019s exports go to the U.S., according to Jennifer Shelley,\na Modelo spokeswoman.  The Crown deal will give wine maker Constellation more\ncontrol over Corona and confidence to invest more heavily in\nbeer, said CEO Sands. The company had faced losing Modelo\u2019s\nbrands at the end of 2016, when the contract with Modelo\nexpired. Owning all of the Crown venture will diversify sales,\nboost profit and give Constellation room to take on other import\nbeers, Kaumil Gajrawala, a New York-based analyst for UBS AG,\nsaid in a note.  \u201cThis deal is a game-changer,\u201d Gajrawala said. It \u201cgives\nthe company a more significant foothold in the U.S. beer\nmarket.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nClementine Fletcher in London at \n cfletcher5@bloomberg.net ;\nDuane D.
