 "context": "The following article called 'Companies Pay $20 Million to Fund Democratic Convention' was published on 2012-09-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCompanies including  Bank of America Corp.  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  have contributed $20 million toward the cost of the Democratic National Convention, helping fund an event that Democrats initially said wouldn\u2019t accept corporate money, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Organizers of this year\u2019s convention in Charlotte,  North Carolina , turned to corporations after the city\u2019s host committee struggled to reach its $36.7 million fundraising goal, according to the people, who requested anonymity.  Last year, the Charlotte host committee set up a separate entity called New American City Inc., to take corporate cash and to which Bank of America and Wells Fargo contributed, according to the people. The two banks were on a list of corporate donors released Sept. 1 by the host committee that also named  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) ,  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  and the law-and- lobbying firm McGuireWoods LLP.  After saying in February 2011 they wouldn\u2019t take corporate money, Democratic Party leaders and convention organizers have grappled with how to cover the estimated $52 million cost of the event, which will culminate Sept. 6 in President  Barack Obama \u2019s renomination acceptance speech.  Duke Energy Chief Executive Officer  Jim Rogers , co-chairman of the host committee, \u201chas said that he secured $10 million to $11 million from local corporations from Charlotte,\u201d said  Tom Williams , a spokesman for Duke. \u201cHe has been working hard to build on those numbers to bring in money\u201d for the convention, Williams said.  Fundraising Target  \u201cWe hit our fundraising target and have the resources we need to host a successful convention,\u201d said Kristie Greco, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Convention Committee.  Suzi Emmerling, a host committee spokeswoman, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Larry DiRita , a spokesman for Charlotte-based Bank of America, declined to comment, while a Wells Fargo representative didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Party officials met to discuss the convention\u2019s budget on Sept. 1, three days before official programming began, in an indication of how cash-strapped the three-day event is, according to one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  One way to cut costs, said the people, would be to switch the final night\u2019s event from Bank of America Stadium to the Time Warner Cable arena, where the first two nights\u2019 events will be held. The arena is an alternate site for the Sept. 6 acceptance speech in case of inclement weather.  \u2018Rain or Shine\u2019  The Obama campaign has insisted that possible severe weather won\u2019t force them to move Obama\u2019s acceptance indoors from the larger outdoor location of Bank of America Stadium, home of the  National Football League \u2019s Carolina Panthers.  \u201cIt will be there rain or shine,\u201d  Ben LaBolt , Obama\u2019s campaign spokesman, told reporters yesterday in Charlotte.  Charlotte Mayor Anthony Foxx, co-chairman of the host committee with Duke\u2019s Rogers, said while the group has had difficulties in raising money, the event will be fine.  \u201cWe can\u2019t have it if we don\u2019t have the resources,\u201d Foxx said in an interview on Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cPolitical Capital with  Al Hunt .\u201d \u201cSo the fact that we\u2019re having it, we\u2019ll have a great convention.\u201d  Rogers \u201chas worked tirelessly to help us bring the convention to the city and to make it successful,\u201d Foxx said.  Republican Convention  Republicans didn\u2019t impose similar fundraising restrictions on the host committee raising money for their convention held last week in Tampa, Florida. The host committee\u2019s website identified  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  among its corporate benefactors. The Tampa and Charlotte host committees must report all of their donors and the amounts to the  Federal Election Commission  after the conventions have ended.  In late June, Democratic convention organizers sought to contain costs by canceling a convention kickoff event at the Charlotte Motor Speedway. In January, Steve Kerrigan, chief executive officer of the convention committee, announced that the convention would be shortened from four days to three and that Obama would deliver his acceptance speech in the almost 74,000-seat Bank of America Stadium.  That decision, including the expense of busing in out-of- state Obama supporters to fill the stadium, added costs to a convention already struggling to raise money under restrictions imposed by the president\u2019s campaign.  In February 2011, the  Democratic National Committee  announced that the Charlotte convention wouldn\u2019t rely on corporate contributions, which is how conventions have traditionally been funded.  Convention \u2018Ownership\u2019  \u201cThis convention and the new way it is being financed will allow more people from all over the country to be involved in this historic event, to have ownership of this convention and help fulfill the president\u2019s vision for moving the country forward,\u201d said  Brad Woodhouse , a Democratic National Committee spokesman.  In May 2011, Democratic convention planners registered New American City to \u201c\u2018hire the staff and raise the funds necessary to support the two nonprofit organizations that have already registered with the commission as host committee for the 2012 Democratic National Convention to be held in Charlotte, North Carolina,\u2019\u2019 according to FEC documents.  New American City, which was initially charged with raising $13 million, was asked to find another $7 million, bringing its total to $20 million, according to the people, who requested anonymity.  Strict Rules  Foxx is president of the second committee and the treasurer is Dan Murrey, who also serves as executive director of the Charlotte in 2012 Convention Host committee, according to the FEC registration.  Democrats imposed strict rules on how corporations could contribute to the Charlotte host committee and barred donations from any banks that received, and failed to repay, bailout funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It would accept in-kind contributions from corporations and cash from corporate foundations.  In May, the Democratic convention returned $50,000 in gift cards donated by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  after the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company was accused of bribing Mexican officials to speed expansion there. The cards were supposed to be used for office supplies.
