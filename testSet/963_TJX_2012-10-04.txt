The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nConsumer confidence  in the U.S.\nclimbed for a sixth straight week, the longest such stretch\nsince early 2006, as Americans grew more secure about their\nfinances.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose in the week ended\nSept. 30 to minus 36.9, a three-month high, from minus 39.6 in\nthe previous period. Households were also less pessimistic about\nthe buying climate and the economy. Another report showed claims\nfor jobless benefits increased last week from a two-month low.  Fifty percent of those surveyed had \u201cpositive\u201d views of\ntheir finances, the most since July, helping explain a pickup in\nSeptember chain-store sales that beat analysts\u2019 forecasts.\nHigher  home values , rising stocks and stable gasoline prices may\nbe alleviating some of the anxiety caused by an  unemployment\nrate  stuck above 8 percent since February 2009.  \u201cThe improvement hasn\u2019t been huge, but it\u2019s definitely\nnoticeable,\u201d said Guy Berger, a U.S. economist at RBS\nSecurities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . \u201cThere feels like\nthere\u2019s a little more traction.\u201d  First-time jobless  claims  climbed by 4,000 to 367,000 in\nthe week ended Sept. 29, according to a report today from the\nLabor Department. A Labor Department report tomorrow may show\nemployers took on 115,000 workers in September, more than the\nprior month, while the jobless rate rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1\npercent, according to the Bloomberg survey median.  Retail Sales  Greater confidence may be helping sustain spending. Sales\nat stores open at least a year rose 3.9 percent, beating the\naverage estimate of a 3.7 percent gain, a survey by Swampscott,\nMassachusetts-based Retail Metrics Inc. showed today.  Purchases at TJX Cos. climbed 6 percent, more than the\naverage estimate for a 4.4 percent gain from analysts surveyed\nby researcher Retail Metrics. Target Corp., the second-largest\nU.S. discounter, posted a 2.1 percent increase. Retailers\nbenefited from back-to-school promotions that drove traffic\nearly in September before tapering off in the middle of the\nmonth.  Stocks rose after the reports and as  Europe \u2019s central bank\nheld the line on  interest rates . The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index\nrose 0.7 percent to 1,461.4 at the close in  New York .  The  European Central Bank  kept its benchmark rate at 0.75\npercent, as projected by 48 out of 52 economists in a Bloomberg\nsurvey.  Orders  placed  with U.S. factories fell in August by the\nmost in more than three years, signaling that slowdowns in\nbusiness investment and exports restrained the expansion,\nCommerce Department figures showed today. The 5.2 percent\ndecrease in bookings was the biggest since January 2009 and\nfollowed a revised 2.6 percent increase.  Three Components  All three of the comfort index\u2019s components improved. The\nbarometer of the state of the  economy  rose to minus 68.7 from\nminus 70.3 the previous week. The index measuring Americans\u2019\nviews on their  personal finances  rose to minus 0.4, the highest\nsince the end of July, from minus 3.6. Americans\u2019 views on the\nbuying climate improved to minus 41.4 from minus 44.8 the\nprevious week.  \u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be a bigger change for the\nbetter considering things couldn\u2019t really get much worse,\u201d said\nMike Ganis, a 27-year-old from  Los Angeles  who works in\ncommunications. As for the economy, \u201chopefully we\u2019ve hit the\nworst and that\u2019s that.\u201d  The consumer comfort gauge averaged minus 41.6 in the\nthird quarter, weaker than the first two quarters. Still, the\naverage is better than any period from the second quarter of\n2008 through the fourth quarter of 2011.  Car Sales  \u201cWe\u2019re finally seeing an uptick in consumer sentiment,\nconsumer confidence,\u201d Kurt McNeil, vice president of U.S. sales\noperations at  General Motors Co. (GM) , said on a conference call on\nOct. 2. The company reported that its U.S. sales rose 1.5\npercent in September from a year earlier.  At the same time, the Bloomberg survey showed 84 percent of\nAmericans rate the economy negatively and 71 percent said they\nthink it is a bad time to buy things they want and need.  The Bloomberg survey showed Americans making more than\n$100,000 became confident in the economy for the first time in\ntwo months.  Confidence improved in all regions except the Midwest, and\noptimism among  women  and renters rose to the highest level since\nApril.  Republicans, Democrats  With the presidential election one month away, advances in\nsentiment over the past few weeks have been bipartisan.\nConfidence among Republicans climbed to minus 34, the highest\nsince April, from minus 42.2 the prior week. The index among\nDemocrats advanced to minus 25.9 from minus 30.1.  Independents were the  most bleak , with sentiment falling to\nminus 44.5 from minus 43.6.  Signs of recovery in the housing market may be bolstering\nconfidence.  Home prices  in 20 U.S. cities climbed more than\nforecast in July from the previous year, according to S&P/Case-\nShiller figures. The gain is helping make up for a slowdown in\nmanufacturing.
