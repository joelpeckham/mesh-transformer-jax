The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nCapital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the\nlender that gets more than half its revenue from credit cards,\nposted a second-quarter profit that beat analysts\u2019 estimates as\na boost in U.S.  consumer confidence  helped fuel spending.  Net income  surged to $1.12 billion, or $1.87 a share, from\n$93 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier, the McLean, Virginia-based company said yesterday in a statement. Profit from\ncontinuing operations, which excludes some items, was $2.07 a\nshare, beating the $1.73 average  estimate  of 28 analysts\nsurveyed by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank has spent more\nthan $28 billion on acquisitions since 2005, making Capital One\nthe eighth-biggest U.S. commercial bank at the end of last year.\nThe firm has sought to return more capital to shareholders,\nannouncing this month that it will repurchase as much as $1\nbillion of stock after completing the sale of a Best Buy Co.\ncredit-card portfolio.  \u201cThey\u2019ve become a more mature and slow-growth company, and\nmanagement has realized that,\u201d  Scott Valentin , an analyst at\nFBR Capital Markets in Arlington,  Virginia , said in an interview\nbefore results were announced. \u201cThat\u2019s sparked the discussion\nabout returning more capital.\u201d  The lender  acquired  the Best Buy assets, comprising private\nlabel and co-branded credit cards, from HSBC Holdings Plc last\nyear as part of a deal that added about $30 billion in assets.\nCapital One also picked up more than $80 billion in deposits\nlast year with the purchase of ING Groep NV\u2019s U.S. online bank.  Consumer Sentiment  Capital One shares rose 2.3 percent to $68.60 in  extended\ntrading  yesterday. The stock climbed 16 percent this year\nthrough the close of regular trading, trailing the 28 percent\nadvance for the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  Net revenue climbed 12 percent to $5.64 billion, beating\nthe $5.52 billion average estimate of analysts in the Bloomberg\nsurvey. Net interest margin, the difference between what banks\npay depositors and what\u2019s earned on loans, widened by 0.12\npercentage point from the first quarter to 6.83 percent.  The results included a $119 million loss from discontinued\noperations that was driven by a $183 million addition to\nreserves to cover the repurchase of faulty mortgages.  Consumer sentiment  improved  last month as Americans grew\nmore upbeat about the economy. The Thomson Reuters/University of\nMichigan index of confidence rose to 84.1 in June from 78.6 at\nthe end of March.  Credit Losses  Credit-card write-offs averaged 4.28 percent for Capital\nOne in the second quarter, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg. Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal of future\ndefaults, averaged 3.05 percent, the data show. Both figures\nwere the highest among the six biggest U.S. issuers.  Capital One has sought to cut credit losses by shifting its\nmarketing to attract affluent customers who spend more and pay\ntheir balances in full each month. The company employs actor\n Alec Baldwin  to promote its Venture card and comic  Jimmy Fallon \nto publicize its cash rewards card. Both cards are geared toward\nwealthier consumers, Valentin said.  \u201cWe will continue to tightly manage costs and  credit\nquality , drive resilient growth in businesses we are\nemphasizing, and focus on returning capital to our investors to\ndeliver sustained  shareholder value ,\u201d Fairbank, 62, said in the\nstatement.  Card purchases rose 12 percent to $50.8 billion from a year\nearlier, according to the statement. U.S. card balances were\n$70.5 billion at the end of June, little changed from March.\nAuto loans advanced 5.1 percent to $29.4 billion from the first\nquarter.  Manhattan Skyscraper  The lender is in talks to take about 250,000 square feet of\noffices at 299 Park Ave., a 1.2 million-square-foot Manhattan\nskyscraper on the market for sublease by UBS AG, two people with\nknowledge of the negotiations said earlier this week. A deal\nwould place the bank in the heart of Midtown\u2019s financial\ncorridor, diagonally across from JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nheadquarters.  Consumer spending  in the U.S., where 93 percent of Capital\nOne card purchases are made, climbed at a 1.5 percent annualized\nrate in the second quarter, according to Commerce Department\nfigures disclosed this week.  American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest credit-card issuer by\npurchases, posted a record profit earlier this week as customer\nspending rose. Net income at the New York-based firm rose 4.9\npercent to $1.41 billion. AmEx fell 3.6 percent yesterday on top\nof a 1.9 percent decline on July 17, the biggest two-day drop\nsince November 2011, amid investor concern that a European\nCommission plan to cap card fees may crimp profit.
