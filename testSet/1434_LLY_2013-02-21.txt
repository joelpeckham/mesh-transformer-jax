 "context": "The following article called 'The Strange History of Corporate Sex Scandals' was published on 2013-02-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAmericans are on familiar terms with\nthe sex scandal. Liaisons in business and politics are regularly\nreported in sordid detail, and typically explained as the\nboneheaded decisions of smart and successful men under the\ninfluence of power and libido.  In the 1950s, such scandals briefly provided an opportunity\nfor a larger national conversation, one that questioned the\nethics of corporate America\u2019s focus on the bottom line and\ngenerated the first systematic advice regarding how to keep sex\nfrom hurting profits. As Max Lerner, a columnist for the  New\nYork  Post, summed it up, the \u201creach of the business spirit into\nsex or perhaps the reach of the sex drive into business\nenterprise\u201d was a new social and commercial reality.  The occasion for this realization was the radio broadcast,\non Jan. 19, 1959, of Edward R. Murrow\u2019s \u201cThe Business of Sex,\u201d\nin which the CBS journalist who stood up to Senator Joseph McCarthy exposed how companies large and small routinely used\ncall girls to close deals and wrote off the cost as a business\nexpense. Some companies, the program charged, kept prostitutes\non their payrolls, listing them as employees in the public-\nrelations department. In New York, Murrow reported, as many as\n30,000 women made their living helping to grease the wheels of\nindustry.  Anonymous executives on the broadcast described the when,\nwhere and how, while a number of women recounted their\nexperiences of being paid to \u201cdate\u201d businessmen. One preferred\nthis job to her experience as a secretary, in which married\nexecutives repeatedly asked her out. Another secured a \u201cverbal\nagreement\u201d for an order of appliances before she went to bed\nwith a company\u2019s client because he was in a \u201cvery anxious mood.\u201d  National Character  The broadcast struck at the heart of postwar concerns about\nmanliness and the nation\u2019s character, concerns that often\nfocused on the white-collar world. After the war, with one in\nfive privately employed Americans working for one of the top 200\ncorporations, the independence of the nation\u2019s men seemed at\nrisk. A country of rugged individualists, critics warned, was\ngiving way to one of paper pushers.  Murrow\u2019s expose suggested something even more unsavory.\nCapitalism itself was implicated, lending the story national\nsignificance in the Cold War effort to prove American values\nsuperior to those of communism.  Questions about the ethical fiber of American businessmen\nhad been growing in urgency since 1948, when Alfred Kinsey\npublished \u201cSexual Behavior in the Human Male.\u201d Twenty-seven\npercent of Kinsey\u2019s subjects who had attended college admitted\nto infidelity by age 50. Kinsey\u2019s report spawned numerous\nstudies on adultery among white-collar men, which psychiatrists\noften traced to the \u201ccompetitive and hard-paced\u201d aspects of\nmodern business and middle-class materialism.  Evidence of the use of prostitutes in business also began\nto proliferate. In 1957, authorities charged Nella Bogart, a\nPolish refugee, with providing prostitutes for  General Electric\nCo. (GE) \u2019s sales convention in  Atlantic City . Time magazine suggested\nthat GE had finally taken the concept of \u201cbeing nice to big\ncustomers\u201d too far. Bogart\u2019s attorney asked the jury to consider\nwhether the executives who testified to hiring Bogart were \u201cany\nbetter\u201d than she was. They voted to acquit.  A Backlash  There was no jury to adjudicate Murrow\u2019s charges, but big\nbusiness immediately denied them. The Hearst chain of newspapers\ncalled the program an \u201coutrageous insult to the great\ninstitutions that form the backbone of America\u2019s economic\nstrength,\u201d and also condemned it for providing fodder for\ncommunists: People throughout the developing world would soon\nhear that the U.S. had \u201creached such a state of decadence its\nbusiness could be transacted only with the aid of \u2018call girls.\u2019\u201d\nMeanwhile, the  Internal Revenue Service  confirmed that some\ncompanies had tried to claim these expenses as business\ndeductions. (Such charges, the IRS assured the public, were\ndisallowed.)  Some commentators emphasized the positive. If nothing else,\nMurrow\u2019s report disproved those, such as novelist  Norman Mailer ,\nwho argued that the supplication required to climb the corporate\nladder robbed men of their virility. As Max Lerner asked, did\nAmericans really want \u201cthe Russians to believe that the virility\nof capitalism thrives only in boardrooms, never in bedrooms? No,\na thousand times no.\u201d  But if such adventures were good news for those worried\nabout businessmen\u2019s libidos, the consensus was that sex scandals\nweren\u2019t beneficial to corporate America\u2019s image. Just a few\nmonths later, another scandal -- this one involving the high-\nliving  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  executive Forrest Teel, who was murdered\nby his spurned mistress, a former file clerk -- again raised\nquestions about the kinds of men who captained American\nenterprise. When the judge allowed radio and film crews into the\ncourtroom, the trial became an international spectacle.  Murrow\u2019s program had ended with a call for Americans to\nexamine the larger cultural implications of using sex to promote\nbusiness. In other words, this wasn\u2019t a story \u201cabout sex.\u201d\nRather, it was about \u201cthe social ethic of our society\u201d and \u201cour\ncapacity to treat each other merely as commodities.\u201d  Conversation along these lines was short-lived, however,\nand was replaced by a discussion of how to manage the negative\nfallout that could accompany the mixing of business and\npleasure. This was most evident in personnel journals, such as\nModern Office Procedures, which increasingly urged companies to\ndevelop policies that would ensure that consensual\nrelationships, adulterous and otherwise, didn\u2019t damage morale\nand productivity or, in the case of executives, become a PR\nnightmare.  Despite this advice, companies expressed an unwillingness\nto pass judgment on an employee\u2019s personal life unless it\nclearly threatened the bottom line.  In many respects, that\u2019s where things remain today. Laws\nagainst sexual harassment changed the sexual culture of the\noffice in some ways, but the majority of American businesses (70\npercent by some estimates) still don\u2019t have policies governing\nconsensual relationships.  It\u2019s also unclear to what degree a sex scandal can affect\nbusiness by alienating customers or hurting profits. Though\ncertainly the loss of a talented executive can cost a company in\na number of ways, the lesson of GE\u2019s prostitution crisis was\nthat its bottom line survived intact.  The company did, however, decide to invite wives to one\nyearly sales convention. And that, for the time, was change.
