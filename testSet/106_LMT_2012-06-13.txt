The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S.  Air Force  has instructed\npilots of the F-22 Raptor to stop wearing a pressure vest during\nroutine flights as the service continues to investigate oxygen-\ndeprivation incidents on the  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  fighter jet.  \u201cRecent testing has identified some vulnerability and\nreliability issues in the upper pressure garment worn by F-22\npilots,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Edward Sholtis, a spokesman for the\nAir Combat Command, said today in an e-mailed statement. He said\nthe Air Force is working to correct the problem.  The Air Force has been trying to figure out why F-22 pilots\nhave suffered from hypoxia-like symptoms that include dizziness\nand disorientation. There have been 11 unexplained incidents\nrelated to a lack of oxygen since the plane resumed flying last\nyear after a four-month halt for safety concerns.  \u201cThe upper pressure garment is not \u2018the\u2019 cause of\nphysiological incidents, and we still have other variables to\nwork through before we can determine what the major factors are\nand how they interact to produce the number of unexplained\nincidents we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Sholtis said.  The Air Force has been studying whether pilots are getting\nenough oxygen and whether the air they breathe may be\ncontaminated.  The pressure vest is the upper portion of the \u201cG suit\u201d\nworn by pilots to withstand high levels of acceleration, or\n\u201cG\u201d forces.  \u2018Tight-Fitting Garment\u2019  Brigadier General Daniel Wyman, the Air Combat Command\u2019s\nsurgeon general, said in an June 11 interview that investigators\nare examining all \u201clife-support garments\u201d used by F-22 pilots.  While Wyman gave no hint of a flaw in the pressure vest, he\nsaid investigators found \u201cthe life-support equipment was not\nappropriately fitted\u201d for pilots \u201cand actually may have\nrestricted their ability to breathe.\u201d  \u201cIt was like a tight-fitting garment that would not fully\nallow you to expand your chest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back out\nto the field, insuring that everyone was wearing their equipment\nappropriately.\u201d  Sholtis said the Air Force is looking at the flight suits\nworn by F-22 pilots in combination with the pressure vests.  Layering Equipment  \u201cTesting has determined that the upper pressure garment\nincreases the difficulty of pilot breathing under certain\ncircumstances,\u201d Sholtis said. \u201cWe\u2019re also looking at the\nlayering of other aircrew flight equipment as contributing to\nthat difficulty.\u201d  The Air Force isn\u2019t ready to label the vest as a cause of\nthe hypoxia symptoms because officials are still gathering data,\naccording to a government official briefed on the latest\ninformation.  The service is looking in particular at the flight suits,\nworn in combination with the pressure vests, by F-22 pilots at\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in  Alaska  and at Joint Base\nLangley-Eustis in  Virginia , according to the official, who spoke\non condition of anonymity because the investigation is being\nhandled in private.  The official said investigators suspect the combinations\nmay be restricting a pilot\u2019s ability to expand his chest and\ntake a full breath.  The Alaska-based pilots wear an arctic survival suit\nintended to protect them after an ejection over cold terrain.\nThose based in Virginia wear anti-exposure suits as protection\nafter an ejection over cold water. While similar to a wet suit,\nit doesn\u2019t fit as tightly.  The pressure vest serves as protection against both G\nforces and a rapid decompression at high altitude.
