(MET)  is in advanced talks to\nbuy the Chilean pension-management unit of  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya\nArgentaria SA (BBVA) , which has a market value of more than $2 billion,\nsaid three people with knowledge of the matter.  MetLife executives may be prepared to sign a deal for the\nunit, known as AFP Provida SA, within days or weeks, said the\npeople, who asked not to be named because the talks are private.\nThe discussions could falter and another bidder could always\nprevail, one of the people said.  MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian is\npursuing growth beyond the U.S. as low interest rates and\nsluggish economic expansion pressure profit at the nation\u2019s\nlargest life insurer. MetLife, based in New York, follows\n Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG)  in seeking revenue from Latin\nAmerica. The Des Moines, Iowa-based insurer agreed in October to\nbuy Chilean pension provider  AFP Cuprum SA (CUPRUM)  for about $1.5\nbillion.  John Calagna , a MetLife spokesman, declined to comment on\nnegotiations, as did Paul Tobin at Bilbao, Spain-based BBVA.\nChilean media, including La Segunda online, have previously\nreported MetLife\u2019s interest.  BBVA has sought buyers for its pension-fund assets in\n Chile ,  Mexico ,  Peru  and Colombia this year as it attempts to\nrecover from Spain\u2019s real estate slump. It agreed last month to\nsell the Mexican operation to a group of local buyers for $1.6\nbillion. BBVA owns a majority stake in Provida, whose shares\ntrade in Santiago.  Pension Providers  MetLife rose 0.5 percent to $33.30 at 9:58 a.m. in New\nYork. American depositary receipts of Provida gained 0.1 percent\nto $101.71. Each ADR is the equivalent of 15 ordinary shares.\nBBVA advanced 1.5 percent to 6.99 euros in Spanish trading.  Provida is Chile\u2019s largest pension fund manager, with about\n$45.5 billion under management as of Nov. 30, according to data\nfrom the country\u2019s pensions regulator. Chilean pension\nproviders, called AFPs, manage a total of $160 billion in\nassets, according to the regulator.  MetLife is targeting return on equity of at least 12\npercent by 2016, driven by growth outside the U.S. The insurer\nsaid in May it\u2019s seeking to boost business in  emerging markets \nto at least 20 percent of operating earnings, from about 14\npercent this year.  Operating earnings from Latin America increased 15 percent\nin the third quarter from a year earlier, excluding the impact\nof currency fluctuations. Growth in premiums, fees and other\nrevenue in Mexico, Brazil and  Argentina  was offset by a decline\nin Chile, the insurer said.  Liquid Assets  The company may consider deals that cost about $2 billion\nto $3 billion, Kandarian said in May as he discussed strategic\nplans. The insurer estimated it would have $5.4 billion in cash\nand liquid assets at the holding-company level at the end of\nthis year, according to a  slide presentation  this month.  The insurer purchased American Life Insurance Co. for about\n$16 billion from  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  in 2010 to\nexpand beyond the U.S. The unit had about 12,500 employees and\noperations in more than 50 countries at the time.  MetLife grew in Japan,  Australia  and the U.K. with the\n$11.7 billion purchase of Travelers Life & Annuity from\nCitigroup Inc. in 2005. The company bought Mexico\u2019s biggest life\ninsurer, Aseguradora Hidalgo SA, for about $962 million in 2002,\nand entered the Brazil dental market with a 2008 acquisition,\nafter opening for business in the country in 1999. It added\nBanco Santander SA\u2019s Chilean insurance units in 2001 for more\nthan $200 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:\nZachary R.
