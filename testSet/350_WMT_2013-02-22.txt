 "context": "The following article called 'Harris Teeter Said to Draw Interest From Retailer Ahold' was published on 2013-02-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHarris Teeter Supermarkets Inc. (HTSI) , the Matthews, North Carolina-based grocery chain exploring a sale, has attracted interest from  Royal Ahold NV (AH) , the Dutch owner of Stop & Shop stores, said people with knowledge of the matter.  Ahold has contacted JPMorgan Chase & Co., retained by Harris Teeter to evaluate options, and is seeking more information on the sale process, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because the negotiations are private. Ahold hasn\u2019t made a formal bid, according to that person.  \u201cWe regard Harris Teeter as a likely deal for Ahold,\u201d Patrick Roquas, an analyst at Rabobank, wrote in a report today. A transaction wouldn\u2019t hurt Ahold\u2019s stock as it\u2019s unlikely that the Amsterdam-based company is willing to put its \u201ccredible track record at risk\u201d by paying too much.  Harris Teeter\u2019s market value tops $2 billion. Buying the chain would help Ahold expand further in the southern U.S. and  Washington , D.C., and its acquisition history and previous expansions position the Dutch chain as a probable bidder, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Karen Short.  Ahold \u201cappears to have more than adequate capacity on its balance sheet to complete a transaction,\u201d she said in a Feb. 20 research note. She also listed Lakeland, Florida-based  Publix Super Markets Inc. (PUSH)  and Cincinnati\u2019s  Kroger Co. (KR)  as possible suitors.  Ahold Stock  Harris Teeter shares  advanced  1.5 percent to $42.12, the highest price in more than six months, at the close yesterday in New York. Ahold  rose  as much as 0.3 percent to 11.01 euros and was trading up 0.2 percent at 12:11 p.m. in Amsterdam. The stock has gained 8.5 percent this year.  Harris Teeter disclosed this month that it hired JPMorgan after receiving advances from two private-equity firms, which the company didn\u2019t name. Representatives at Harris Teeter, JPMorgan and Publix declined to comment, while a spokesman for Ahold said the company doesn\u2019t comment on market rumors. An official at Kroger didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment.  Harris Teeter was co-founded in 1960 by two North Carolina grocers, according to its website. It has more than 200 stores in North Carolina, South Carolina,  Virginia ,  Georgia ,  Tennessee ,  Maryland ,  Delaware , Florida and Washington, D.C. The company reported $4.54 billion in revenue for the year ended Oct. 2, 2012.  Value Indication  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization over the same period amounted to $306.5 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Grocery companies typically sell at 7 to 10 times Ebitda, said one of the people familiar with the situation, indicating Harris Teeter\u2019s sale value could be as much as $3.1 billion.  About 60 percent of Ahold\u2019s  sales  come from the U.S., where it also owns Giant stores, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company has sold assets in the country over the last 10 years after an accounting fraud at an acquired business in the U.S. This month the Dutch company said it agreed to sell its 60 percent stake in Swedish grocery chain ICA for more than $3 billion.  Some brokerages including Barclays expressed skepticism that Ahold would buy all of Harris Teeter, suggesting that returning proceeds from the ICA deal to shareholders would be a better option than buying a grocer that competes against grocers including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   \u201cWe have already assumed in our model that Ahold will return the ICA proceeds to shareholders in the second half via a share consolidation,\u201d Barclays analysts, including James Anstead in  London , said in a note. \u201cIf the cash was instead spent on significantly increasing Ahold\u2019s exposure to an industry which is undoubtedly competitive, then we would expect shareholders to be unimpressed.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story: David Welch in New York at  dwelch12@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Jeffrey McCracken at  jmccracken3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 57.155704498291016 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
