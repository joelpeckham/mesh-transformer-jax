 "context": "The following article called 'Ebix\u2019s Raina Loses Magic Touch as U.S. Probes Accounting' was published on 2013-06-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRobin Raina always had the magic\ntouch, or so it seemed until Wednesday, when the disclosure of a\nU.S. criminal probe of his software company\u2019s accounting\npractices blew up a proposed $820 million deal with Goldman\nSachs Group Inc. to take the firm private.  Prior to that disclosure by  Ebix Inc. (EBIX) , which sent its stock\ndown 44 percent, Raina looked like he could do no wrong. He\nsaved a dying company at age 32, re-booted it as an e-commerce\nsite for the insurance industry, and propelled it through a\ndecade of rapid growth. He established the firm as a fixture on\nthe annual lists of fastest-growing tech stocks tracked by\nFortune magazine and Forbes.  Raina transformed himself along the way. Born to a well-to-do family in northern India, he amassed a paper fortune of about\n$100 million and settled into a life of American opulence in a\nsix-bedroom mansion in suburban Atlanta. He created a\nmultimillion-dollar charity to build homes for slum dwellers in\nIndia, and to help polish his image, financed two documentary\nfilms about his philanthropic pursuits.  Yet the public attention he so carefully courted eventually\nbecame a liability for Ebix, which had $199 million in revenue\nlast year. Besieged by short-sellers and hounded by regulatory\nprobes and lawsuits -- including one filed last month by\n Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  -- Raina announced plans to take Ebix private\nthis summer in an $820 million leveraged buyout funded by\nGoldman Sachs.  Intensify Scrutiny  But now short-sellers may be the least of his problems, as\nmore details about Ebix\u2019s accounting are revealed in court\nfilings, and the Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice\nDepartment intensify their scrutiny of the Atlanta-based firm.  The $20-per-share Goldman deal, had it gone through, would\nhave yielded a $40 million windfall for Raina and left him with\na 29 percent stake in the new company. The buyout would also\nhave given him the last laugh in an increasingly nasty war with\nhis critics, punishing short-sellers who were betting that Ebix\nshares were worth less than $10, and allowing him to use Goldman\nSachs\u2019s reputation as the ultimate endorsement of Ebix\u2019s\nearnings.  The proposed LBO, announced May 1, provided for a 45-day\n\u201cgo-shop\u201d period, during which any other prospective buyer\nwould be allowed to beat New York-based Goldman Sachs\u2019s offer.  Rather than other suitors, however, the only significant\nparty to make inquiries during that period was the U.S. Attorney\nin Atlanta, who sent a letter to the company on June 14\ninforming Raina \u201cthat it had opened an investigation into\nallegations of intentional misconduct,\u2019 according to a company\nstatement, which linked the probe to accounting fraud claims.  \u2018Naturally Disappointed\u2019  \u201cWe want to thank Goldman Sachs for their interest in\nacquiring Ebix and we are naturally disappointed that we could\nnot complete a transaction at this time,\u201d Raina said in the\nstatement. \u201cThe company\u2019s balance sheet remains strong and we\nbelieve the company is well positioned for future growth.\u201d  Goldman Sachs said that it was \u201cunable to move forward\u201d\nwith the deal because of \u201cthis recent development.\u201d The\nAtlanta U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined comment.  In 2011, after a 10-year stretch of impressive growth,\nskepticism about Ebix\u2019s earnings emerged in the form of an\nanonymous blog posting on Seeking Alpha, suggesting that the\ncompany was a \u201chouse of cards.\u201d  The posting sparked a one-day selloff, leading to a 24\npercent decline in Ebix\u2019s share price, and knocking the\ncompany\u2019s market cap from $1.2 billion to $878 million. The\ncompany denied the allegations.  In the ensuing months, Ebix was sued by a former executive,\nwho claimed that accounting irregularities had cost him and two\nformer colleagues a $1.5 million bonus, and by a class-action\nlaw firm, which used the Internet allegations as the basis for a\nshareholder suit claiming fraud on the part of Raina and his\nteam. Ebix rejected the claims, seeking to have them dismissed.  SEC Probe  Even as the company kept posting increases in revenues and\nearnings -- driven in part by a series of acquisitions -- Ebix\nfailed in its attempts last year to get the lawsuits dismissed\nand the SEC began a probe of the company\u2019s accounting practices.  The pressure mounted in February of this year when another\nshort seller, Daniel Yu of Gotham City Research, published his\nown attack on Ebix\u2019s financial statements, also on Seeking\nAlpha. In response, Raina held a conference call with an analyst\nin which he tried to refute some of the Gotham City claims,\nwhile avoiding any discussion of the SEC investigation.  A tennis buff and obsessive ping-pong player, Raina served\nup the Goldman Sachs buyout plan artfully, announcing the $20-per-share offer a week before disclosing to investors that his\ncompany was already being probed by the SEC and the Internal\nRevenue Service, facts that might have sent his company\u2019s share\nprice south had it not been for the Goldman Sachs deal. The IRS\nprobe relates to Ebix\u2019s use of off-shore subsidiaries in low-tax\ncountries, two people familiar with the matter said last month.\nEbix has said that it\u2019s cooperating with the IRS, and that it\u2019s\nregularly reviewed and audited by domestic and foreign tax\nauthorities.  More Details  Now, as the company tries to find an alternative buyer,\naccording to its statement, Raina will probably face more\nquestions about his company\u2019s accounting and compliance\npractices. New details may emerge in court filings as he\nprepares to be questioned in two lawsuits that are headed to\ntrial.  Ebix plunged $8.72 to $11.00 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock\nMarket trading.  The SEC probe comes while the commission has begun to focus\non the type of gray areas that have been essential to Ebix\u2019s\nsuccess, namely the company\u2019s use of an accounting policy that\nallows it to report relatively high book earnings while\nminimizing taxable income.  Under Raina\u2019s leadership, no regulatory allegations have\nbeen filed against the company, and none of Ebix\u2019s four auditors\nduring the past decade has issued anything other than a clean\nopinion of its financials.  Questions Abound  Still, questions abound about the quality of Ebix\u2019s\nearnings, according to accounting experts such as Joseph Carcello, co-founder of the Corporate Governance Center at the\nUniversity of  Tennessee .  Carcello pointed to the company\u2019s use of four auditors over\nthe past decade, along with Ebix\u2019s reliance on earnings from\nforeign subsidiaries, which haven\u2019t been audited by its current\nfirm, Cherry Bekaert, according to securities filings.  \u201cYou have multiple auditor changes, the heavy percentage\nof operations overseas, the lack of filings overseas,\u201d said\nCarcello in a phone interview, prior to the termination of the\nGoldman Sachs deal. \u201cYou start putting it all together and,\nalthough we don\u2019t have evidence of anything fraudulent, what we\ndo have is a lot of questions.\u201d  Marc Cohodes, a short-seller who helped expose accounting\nfrauds at Lernout & Hauspie, Aremisoft and Computer Associates,\nquestioned the quality of Ebix\u2019s earnings and the motivations\nbehind the deal.  \u201cIn my experience uncovering and dealing with some of the\ngreat software frauds in the past, Ebix could rise to that\nlevel,\u201d Cohodes said.  Cohodes said he\u2019d \u201cnever seen a company being investigated\nor sued on so many fronts\u201d while it was a takeover target.  Sales Skills  From an early age, Raina\u2019s sales skills set him apart from\nhis peers. After graduating with an industrial engineering\ndegree from Thapar University in Punjab in 1990, he joined a\ncompany that distributed Dell Inc. computer products in  India .\nFirst in Mumbai, then in New Delhi, he became one of the\ncompany\u2019s top salesmen.  His next stops were Singapore and the U.S. There he was\nrecruited in 1997 to help turn around Delphi Information\nSystems, an also-ran in the business-to-business software\nindustry. Delphi\u2019s sales had dropped from $53 million to $28\nmillion over the previous two years.  As head of sales and marketing, Raina immersed himself in\nother parts of the company.  \u2019Very Aggressive\u2019  \u201cRobin was very aggressive, open to change and open to new\nbusiness models,\u201d said Bill Baumel, a board member at the time.\n\u201dHe was ready to be unleashed.\u201d  By 1999, Raina was pushing an entirely new platform for\nDelphi, a Web portal called Ebix. In September of that year, the\nboard named Raina, who had just turned 32, chief executive\nofficer of the publicly traded company.  Raina initially drew on the expertise of a board of\ndirectors who had deep experience in management, insurance and\ntechnology. Even as he learned from the directors, many of whom\nwere older, he clashed with them on a few issues, including\ncompensation, several of them said.  \u201dThere were a lot of battles,\u201d recalled Dennis Drislane,\nwho was recruited to the Ebix board in 2000. \u201dHe makes a\ndecision and acts. The old board wanted to see a five-year plan,\nor a one-year plan. That was not Robin.\u201d  When Raina talked about acquisitions, board member Doug\nChisholm would press him to project growth from acquisitions and\nexisting business in any given year. Raina balked.  \u2019Very Astute\u2019  \u201dHe had it all in his mind,\u201d said Chisholm, who had come\nto Ebix from Hewlett Packard Co. \u201dRobin was very astute at\nassessing distressed properties and assets, and making an offer\nto people who wanted out.\u201d  As early as 2002, after the turnaround had taken hold but\nbefore the company was flush with cash, Raina pushed the idea of\noutsourcing the company\u2019s software production to India. Several\ndirectors wanted to wait until the company\u2019s finances were\nstronger.  Raina dug in on the India initiative and set up shop\noutside of New Delhi. To showcase Ebix\u2019s new offices, Raina flew\nseveral directors to India for a meeting.  Drislane said his only issue with the subsidiary was a lack\nof transparency.  \u201cThat\u2019s where things got a little murky,\u201d he recalled.\n\u201dThere was a lot of stuff in India that we didn\u2019t have\nvisibility on.\u201d Still, he regarded the India project as a\nsuccess, he said. Jonathan Keehner, a spokesman for Ebix,\ndeclined to comment in a written statement.  Net Income  Through internal growth and acquisitions, Raina transformed\nEbix from a loss of $11 million on sales of $12 million in 2000\nto $4.3 million in net income on sales of $24 million in 2005.  He strengthened profit margins by running a lean operation,\nkeeping a tight grip on expenses and cutting staff at acquired\ncompanies. He also took newly acquired software assets and\ncombined them with operations in India and  Singapore , where Ebix\nbenefits from low tax rates  \u201dRobin was ahead of the curve,\u201d Drislane said of the\noutsourcing initiative. \u201dHe cut costs and increased\nproductivity, and he did it on his own. There were no\nconsultants, no partners. He can be arrogant and difficult to\ndeal with, but he is smart.\u201d  By 2006, Raina had replaced his old board with a new set of\ndirectors, four of whom are based in Europe.  \u201dThere were a lot of battles, and that was one reason he\nwanted a new board,\u201d Drislane said. When Chisholm\u2019s term\nexpired in 2004, he recalled, it was clear Raina didn\u2019t want him\nto stand for re-election. Baumel, Raina\u2019s biggest champion, said\nhe stepped down because of the time and travel required of an\nEbix director. Ebix spokesman Keehner declined to comment.  Foreign Subsidiaries  Along with the foreign representation on the board came\nthe addition of subsidiaries around the world, not just in\ncountries where Ebix did business. They included Sweden and\nMauritius, where holding companies were registered to serve as\nnodes in the company\u2019s complex web of financial transactions.  Even as Ebix\u2019s accounting issues have grown more complex,\nthe company has migrated toward smaller, less expensive auditing\nfirms in the U.S. KPMG LLP, which had been Delphi\u2019s auditor,\nreported potential shortcomings in Ebix\u2019s internal controls in\n2003.  In 2004, as part of a cost-cutting move, Ebix replaced the\nBig Four accounting firm with BDO LLP. BDO also identified\ndeficiencies \u201drelating to the company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting,\u201d according to a securities filing.  \u2019Inadequate Documentation\u2019  The deficiencies related \u201dto the lack of accounting\nknowledge and leadership in foreign locations, inadequate\ndocumentation for certain accounting transactions, insufficient\nanalysis and review of domestic account reconciliations, lack of\ndocumentation of development costs and related agreements, and\nthe lack of documentation to support the company\u2019s income tax\nprovisions and related accounts,\u201d according to a 2005\nsecurities filing.  Not a problem, Raina said. He and his chief financial\nofficer at the time, Richard Baum, reviewed the matter and\nconcluded that \u201dthe company\u2019s internal control over financial\nreporting is effective,\u201d according to the filing.  The willingness of the board\u2019 audit committee to allow\nRaina to ratify the company\u2019s internal controls is alarming,\nsaid Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the SEC.  \u201dThis is not an accident waiting to happen -- it\u2019s an\naccident in motion,\u201d Turner said.  In April 2007, Ebix replaced BDO with an Atlanta-based\naccounting firm, Habif, Arogeti & Wynne.  Acquisition Spurt  During the next 20 months, Raina spent more than $90\nmillion to acquire five companies, including an Australian\nsoftware provider, lifting Ebix\u2019s revenue to $75 million. After\nthis buying spree, Habif, Arogeti & Wynne resigned as auditor in\nDecember 2008. The firm declined to immediately comment.  The timing of the resignation seems unusual, according to\nCarcello, since it occurred before the audit engagement was\ncompleted, and \u201din the teeth of the worst recession in many\nyears.\u201d  The new auditor, Cherry Bekaert, signed off on Ebix\u2019s\nfinancial statements for 2008.  In 2009 the buying spree continued, as Raina spent $62.5\nmillion on acquisitions, and Ebix\u2019s revenue grew to $97.7\nmillion. Even as Ebix increased in size, Raina maintained tight\ncontrol over accounting-related decisions, several former Ebix\nexecutives said.  Unusual Structure  Each month, Raina would meet with controller Sean Donaghy\nand Darren Joseph, corporate vice president of finance and human\nresources, to go over the company\u2019s revenue and determine how it\nshould be allocated, said two former executives, who asked not\nto be named. Absent from this group was Robert Kerris, the\ncompany\u2019s chief financial offer, who relied on the trio\u2019s\ndecisions when compiling the company\u2019s financial disclosures,\nsaid the former executives, who requested anonymity because the\nmatter wasn\u2019t public.  The structure is unusual, said Carcello.  \u201dWhenever you see a company where the CEO takes an active,\nongoing interest in how transactions are accounted for, that\u2019s a\nhuge red flag,\u201d he said. \u201cChief executives need to run the\nbusiness, they don\u2019t need to run the accounting.\u201d  Ebix spokesman Keehner didn\u2019t directly address Raina\u2019s role\nin reviewing the company\u2019s revenue allocation. He said in his\nstatement that \u201cThe CFO is an integral part of this process,\nand the primary contact with Cherry Bekaert.\u201d  \u201cThe members of the audit committee reviewed, and the\nchairman of the committee discussed with management and Cherry\nBekaert LLP\u201d financial information \u201ccontained in each\nquarterly and annual earnings release prior to the release of\nsuch information to the public,\u201d Keehner said.  More Revenues  As Ebix began to allocate more revenue to offshore\nsubsidiaries, Cherry Bekaert had to rely more on the company\u2019s\nforeign financial statements.  Several overseas subsidiaries have fallen behind in filing\naudited numbers. Ebix Singapore, which accounted for $25.2\nmillion of Ebix\u2019s $78 million in pretax income last year,\naccording to SEC filings, still hasn\u2019t filed locally audited\nfigures for 2011 or 2012.  Ebix India, which recorded $35.7 million of the company\u2019s\npretax income last year, hasn\u2019t filed audited figures for 2012.\nEIH Holdings, the company\u2019s Swedish subsidiary, is being\nliquidated by Swedish regulators for lack of timely filings.\nYet, according to SEC filings approved by Cherry Bekaert, the\nSwedish unit earned $7 million of the company\u2019s $78 million in\npre-tax income last year.  As for Ebix Asia Holdings Ltd., the company\u2019s subsidiary in\nMauritius, an island nation in Indian Ocean, the only filing\navailable online is a registration. No earnings or revenues have\nbeen attributed to the unit since its inception in 2008.  Even if Ebix finds an alternative buyer, some accounting\nissues will remain. As part of a lawsuit filed by a former\nexecutive in 2011, and scheduled to go to trial next year,\nallegations of accounting irregularities at the company have\nbeen made in court papers.  The complaint was filed in an Ohio federal court by the\nfounder of Peak Performance Solutions, which Ebix acquired in\n2009. Peak\u2019s founder, Steven Isaac, and two partners say that\nEbix owes them a $1.5 million \u201dearnout\u201d as part of the sale.  Different Calculations  Filings in the lawsuit allege that the company\u2019s controller\nand CFO provided different calculations of Peak\u2019s revenues in\nthe year after the acquisition. Peak\u2019s founders also reported\nthat an Ebix check sent to them bounced. Raina, in a 2011\ninterview, blamed the bounced checks on a mistake at Bank of\nAmerica Corp.  In a court filing earlier this month, Peak\u2019s lawyers\ndisclosed that Cherry Bekaert had notified Ebix in March 2010\nthat \u201dit had found significant deficiencies in internal\ncontrols and the company\u2019s accounting operations,\u201d including\nerrors in preliminary financial statements, schedules and\ndisclosures, insufficient analysis and lack of documentation to\nsupport revenue recognition.  Ebix spokesman Keehner said the accounting firm had\nnotified the company\u2019s audit committee of its findings. He\ndeclined further comment on the matter.  Two Subpoenas  SEC investigators, who have issued two subpoenas to Ebix,\naccording to the company\u2019s latest quarterly statement, have also\nexpressed interest in payouts that have been promised if\nacquired firms reach revenue targets, according to a person who\nhas discussed the issue with the agency.  Investigators are examining the possibility that Raina\u2019s\npreference for embedding an earnout in the acquisition price\ncould create a \u201dcookie jar\u201d that the company can later to use\nto boost income, according to the person, who requested\nanonymity because the matter is confidential.  For example, when Ebix announced the Peak acquisition in\n2009, it set aside $8 million for the purchase, which consisted\nof a $6.5 million cash payment, and an accrual of $1.5 million\nfrom Ebix\u2019s cash reserves to be paid out when Peak hit its\nrevenue targets over a 12-month period.  Microsoft Lawsuit  In 2011, after concluding that Peak failed to achieve those\ntargets -- a determination being contested by Peak in its\nlawsuit -- Ebix management reversed the $1.5 million accrual,\nwhich flowed directly to its bottom line. It didn\u2019t adjust the\ngoodwill associated with the original purchase downward. Thus,\nEbix was able to convert $1.5 million from its cash reserve in\n2009 into $1.5 million in net income for 2010.  The due diligence team at Goldman Sachs had an opportunity\nto review the claims made in the Peak lawsuit, as well as in a\nclass-action suit filed two years ago. The Microsoft suit,\nhowever, was filed after the announcement of the LBO.  Microsoft claimed Ebix breached its licensing contract and\nignored the company\u2019s demand for an audit to determine the\nextent of overuse, according to the complaint. Ebix said it was\nusing unlicensed copies of the company\u2019s software products while\nputting off Microsoft\u2019s attempt to conduct an independent audit,\naccording to the filing. Keehner declined to comment on the\nsuit.  Charity Work  Raina is eager to talk about his work in India and seems to\nrevel in the publicity. Through his charity, the Robin Raina\nFoundation, he has financed the construction of more than 1,700\nhomes for slum dwellers in New Delhi.  In various Indian television interviews, which Raina has\nposted to YouTube Inc.\u2019s website, he is referred to as\n\u201dSanta,\u201d the \u201dkindest millionaire,\u201d \u201dan angel for poor\npeople\u201d and an \u201dexample of patriotism.\u201d  Two years ago, in response to questions about Ebix\u2019s\naccounting practices, Raina passed along an e-mail account of a\ntour through New Delhi\u2019s slums with the family of one of his\nshareholders.  \u201dRobin was treated like a God,\u201d wrote Kathryn Lebovitz,\nwhose father, Steven Lebovitz of G&L Realty, owned Ebix stock.\n\u201dA group of at least 100 people followed us around chanting his\nname and waving and smiling at all of us.\u201d  In 2009, the foundation produced a documentary celebrating\nRaina\u2019s work with the underprivileged, called \u201dMere Apney,\u201d or\n\u201dMy own people.\u201d  \u2019Dilli\u2019  Two years later, the foundation financed another\ndocumentary, \u201cDilli,\u201d which celebrated Raina\u2019s work with the\nunderprivileged. It was shot and directed by Black Ticket Films.  At Ebix, Raina is less involved in day-to-day operations\nthan he was a decade ago, as evidenced by his focus on the\n\u2019Dilli\u2019 documentary. Raina\u2019s primary areas of interest are\nidentifying acquisition targets and cutting costs, according to\npeople who have worked for him.  Rolf Herter, an Ebix director, said in a statement provided\nby Keehner that \u201cRobin remains as committed to Ebix today as\nwhen he joined the company.\u201d  Last year, after former Delphi board member Larry Gerdes\nsold his own Atlanta-based company, he received a call from\nRaina. In the course of congratulating Gerdes, Raina broached\nthe idea of selling Ebix.  \u201dRobin didn\u2019t feel like the public markets were valuing\nhis company appropriately,\u201d Gerdes said. \u201dHe was frustrated\nwith managing a public entity.\u201d  Grown Weary  Raina had also grown weary of defending himself against\nshort-sellers, who have amassed a large negative position in the\nstock, said David Collins of Catalyst Global, who served as\nEbix\u2019s outside investor-relations spokesman from 2004 to 2006.  The Goldman Sachs deal would have given him a way out.  \u201dThe sale of company was Robin\u2019s only way to get his life\nback,\u201d Collins said in an interview prior to the announcement\nof the deal\u2019s demise. \u201dI can relate to a guy who\u2019s come to\nAmerica as a land of opportunity, and created huge wealth for\nanyone willing to invest in him, and he\u2019s publicly reviled and\nhis charitable activities are questioned in a purely personal\nway.\u201d  The shorts saw a dash to the exits.  \u201dWho\u2019s pregnant here?\u201d asked short-seller Cohodes, who\nhas clashed with Goldman Sachs in the past, before the deal was\nscrapped. \u201dWhat was the rush to do this deal? Why wouldn\u2019t\nanyone want the regulatory process, the legal process to work\nitself through?\u201d  Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said in an\ne-mailed statement that the bank \u201cdid comprehensive due\ndiligence over a period of months working closely with our\noutside advisors, but the DOJ investigation launched subsequent\nto our signing was a new fact.\u201d  Facebook  Raina communicates information about Ebix with shareholders\non conference calls following quarterly earnings statements, and\nat \u201cinvestor day\u201d meetings. As for his philanthropic efforts,\nhe uses his Facebook Inc. website account to expound on his\nbeliefs.  In a Facebook posting three years ago, Raina mused on the\nimportance of charity, and how his battle to eliminate poverty\nfrom the planet by 2050 helped him keep his business\naccomplishments in perspective.  \u201dAs I reflected more on what I saw and tried to think\nabout my own life, I realized that even though I had built a so-called \u2019successful business\u2019 it did not guarantee happiness to\nme irrespective of who I was or how much I had,\u201d he wrote. \u201dI\nthought I had built security, I thought I had built success. But\nin reality what I had built was an illusion.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nGreg Farrell in  New York  at   gregfarrell@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nMichael Hytha at   mhytha@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Ebix, Inc. was 10.216296195983887 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Ebix, Inc. was ",
