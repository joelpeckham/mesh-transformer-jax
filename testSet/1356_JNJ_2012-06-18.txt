 "context": "The following article called 'Drugmakers Don\u2019t Owe Sales Force Overtime, Top Court Says' was published on 2012-06-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDrugmakers don\u2019t have to pay\novertime to their sales representatives, the U.S. Supreme Court\nruled in a decision that saves the industry billions of dollars\nand marks a defeat for the Obama administration.  The justices, voting 5-4 in a case involving a\n GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  unit, said pharmaceutical salespeople are\nexempt from a federal wage-and-hour law. The court is nearing\nthe end of its term, with rulings on the health-care overhaul\nand Arizona\u2019s immigration law still to come.  More than a dozen wage-and-hour cases had been filed\nagainst drugmakers -- including  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ,  Bristol-Myers\nSquibb Co. (BMY)  and units of  Novartis AG (NOVN)  and  Merck & Co. (MRK)  -- by\nworkers charged with persuading doctors to prescribe the\ncompany\u2019s products. Business groups said billions of dollars\nwere at stake.  The Obama administration threw its support behind the sales\nrepresentatives in a 2009 court filing. The administration said\nthe exemption in the Fair Labor Standards Act for \u201coutside\nsalesmen\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to drug-industry representatives.  The court today said that position wasn\u2019t entitled to any\nspecial deference because the Labor Department laid out its\nviews in court papers rather than through a formal rulemaking\nproceeding.  The case split the court along ideological lines. Justice\n Samuel Alito  wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice\nJohn Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia,  Anthony Kennedy  and\nClarence Thomas.  Promoting Product  Two former Glaxo salesmen, Michael Shane Christopher and\nFrank Buchanan, argued that the sales exception doesn\u2019t apply\nbecause drug industry representatives only promote the product -\n- and don\u2019t actually sell it -- during their visits to doctors\u2019\noffices.  Alito rejected that reasoning. The sales representatives\u2019\n\u201cend goal was not merely to make physicians aware of the\nmedically appropriate uses of a particular drug,\u201d he\nwrote.\u201cRather, it was to convince physicians actually to\nprescribe the drug in appropriate cases.\u201d  In dissent, Justice  Stephen Breyer  said a sales\nrepresentative \u201cdoes not take orders\u201d and \u201cdoes not\nconsummate a sale.\u201d  The justices focused their ruling on the particular\ncharacteristics of the pharmaceutical industry, limiting the\nimpact of the decision on other businesses.  Sales Techniques  Some drugmaker shares rose. Glaxo\u2019s American depositary\nreceipts, each representing two ordinary shares, rose 28 cents\nto $45.35 at 11:18 a.m. in trading on the New York Stock\nExchange.  Glaxo said its representatives are trained in sales\ntechniques, learning how to obtain a commitment from doctors to\nprescribe the company\u2019s medicines. Glaxo also said its\nsalespeople are paid in part through incentives that are tied to\nsales volume and market share in assigned territory.  The drug industry said the 2009 Labor Department filing\nmarked a reversal of 70 years of practice.  The suit, which sought class action status, targeted\nGlaxoSmithKline LLC, a U.S. unit of the London-based drugmaker.  The case is Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham, 11-204.
