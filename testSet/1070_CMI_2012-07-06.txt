 "context": "The following article called 'Navistar Falls on Costs for Engines to Meet U.S. Rules' was published on 2012-07-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nNavistar International Corp. (NAV) , the\nmaker of International brand trucks, fell the most in four weeks\nafter saying it expects additional costs to introduce an engine\nthat will meet U.S. emission standards after its earlier\ntechnology failed to comply.  Navistar  declined  16 percent to $24.24 at 1:54 p.m. in  New\nYork , after earlier sliding to $24.04, the biggest intraday\ndecline since June 7. The shares dropped 24 percent this year\nthrough yesterday.  Navistar said the engine, called In-Cylinder Technology\nPlus, adds \u201curea-based aftertreatment\u201d to its exhaust gas\nrecirculation, or EGR, technology to meet 2010 U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency rules. A 13-liter engine will be\navailable in early 2013, with a 15-liter engine to follow, the\ncompany said in a slideshow  presentation .  \u201cWe will need to expand our product development efforts,\nbut we will work hard to minimize this incremental spend,\u201d\nChief Financial Officer Andrew Cederoth said on a conference\ncall, during which the company did not take questions from\nanalysts. \u201cWhen we launch, we anticipate some incremental cost\nto accommodate the additional hardware.\u201d  The failure of the company\u2019s previous engines to comply\nwith EPA regulations helped trigger a fall in the shares and\nmake Lisle, Illinois-based Navistar, which also makes commercial\nand military trucks as well as buses, a potential takeover\ntarget.  Costs, Discounting  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that there are going to be some\nissues here,\u201d  David Leiker , an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.\nin  Milwaukee , said today in a telephone interview. \u201cThey\u2019re\nprobably going to have to discount the current technology to\nsell it until the new technology is available, and then there\u2019s\nthe cost to bring this new technology to market. It\u2019d be nice\nfor them to clarify that, but it\u2019s not going to happen today.\u201d  Leiker rates Navistar shares neutral.  Navistar invested $600 million to develop EGR heavy truck\nengines, which failed to meet the 2010 rules. The  U.S. Court of\nAppeals  in  Washington  on June 12 threw out a U.S. EPA interim\nrule that allowed Navistar to keep selling noncompliant engines\nif it paid penalties of as much as $2,000 each.  Navistar didn\u2019t clarify where it stands with EPA\ncertification of EGR engines or what fines it will have to\npay until the new engine is ready, Brian Sponheimer, an analyst\nat Gabelli & Co. in Rye, New York, said in a phone interview.  More Questions  The new engine \u201creduces some tail risks to the company,\nspecifically as it relates to bankruptcy and being left with a\nstranded strategy in the months ahead,\u201d said Sponheimer, who\nrecommends buying the shares. The conference call \u201cbegged more\nquestions than it answered,\u201d he said.  The EPA and  California Air Resources Board  are\n\u201csupportive\u201d and \u201cwilling to engage immediately\u201d in\nreviewing the engine\u2019s performance, according to Navistar\u2019s\npresentation. The company said it\u2019s in discussions with\nregulators about assuring uninterrupted sales during the\ntransition to the new engines.  Navistar should have announced a dual-sourcing strategy\nusing its own technology along with engines from  Cummins Inc. (CMI) ,\nSponheimer said. Navistar\u2019s shares surged 11 percent on June 29\nafter OTR Global LLC said the company may start offering engines\nfrom Columbus, Indiana-based Cummins.  \u2018Infield Single\u2019  \u201cThat would have been a home run,\u201d Sponheimer said.\n\u201cWhat the company provided today was an infield single.\nProviding its customers a choice of engine could only help its\nmarket share and help leverage truck platforms.\u201d  Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  increased his stake in\nNavistar to 11.9 percent in June and hedge fund manager  Mark Rachesky  disclosed a bigger position,  13.6 percent , as Navistar\nslumped to a three-year low last month, prompting the company to\nadopt a poison pill to help fend off hostile bids.  Navistar\u2019s push to develop its own engine could make an\nacquisition by another company \u201cmore tricky,\u201d Rob Wertheimer,\nan analyst at Vertical Research Partners in New York, wrote in a\nresearch note. The company is a \u201cnatural fit\u201d for  Volkswagen\nAG (VOW) , which controls truck makers MAN SE and  Scania AB (SCVB) , or  Fiat\nIndustrial SpA (FI) , said Wertheimer, who revised his rating on\nNavistar today to hold from buy.  \u201cNavistar\u2019s timeline and hopes of EPA support don\u2019t take\naway all the risk that the company could be out of the market\u201d\nuntil the new engine is ready, he wrote. \u201cOn the other hand, if\nNavistar can stay in the market through the launch of this\nengine, it remains an attractive target, with a very good brand,\ndealer network, and technology.\u201d  Profit Forecasts  Navistar last month lowered its full-year profit forecast\nto a range of break-even to $2 a share, excluding some costs. In\nFebruary, the company forecast 2012 profit of as much as $5.75 a\nshare, then reduced the figure to a maximum of $5.25 a share in\nMarch.  \u201cIt would be best to allow the process with the EPA to\ncome to completion before we comment further on our financial\nforecasts,\u201d the company said in its presentation. \u201cAs to\nliquidity, our current position remains stable, and we believe\nwe have access to additional financing sources if appropriate.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nCraig Trudell in Southfield, Michigan at \n ctrudell1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Bill Koenig  at \n wkoenig@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Cummins Inc. was 77.4571533203125 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Cummins Inc. was ",
