 "context": "The following article called 'Search for Armstrong\u2019s Secret Sauce Is Focus of Amateur Cycling' was published on 2013-05-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOrganizers of the  Gran Fondo New York \nbike race don\u2019t want an amateur  Lance Armstrong  among the 6,000\ncyclists competing in the 105-mile event next weekend.  So they are spending $15,000 on drug tests sanctioned by\nthe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, the same organization whose\ninvestigation led Armstrong to confess that he cheated to win\nseven Tour de France championships by using performance-enhancing drugs.  With cycling participation in the U.S. up 66 percent --\nthere were 70,829 USA Cycling licenses  issued  in 2011, an\nincrease from 42,724 in 2002 -- organizers of top U.S. amateur\nevents are spending more on drug testing to maintain legitimacy.  \u201cCycling sort of carries that burden with it,\u201d Gary Wadler, chairman of the  World Anti-Doping Agency \u2019s Prohibited\nList and Methods Subcommittee and author of \u201cDrugs and the\nAthlete\u201d said in a telephone interview. \u201cWhen you test, it\u2019s\nthe deed that counts, not just words. It\u2019s measurable and there\nis no deniability.\u201d  Gran fondo loosely translates from Italian to \u201cbig ride,\u201d\nand Uli Fluhme, a former UBS hedge-fund attorney and co-founder\nof the  New York  race, describes it as a \u201cmarathon on bikes.\u201d  First held in 2011, the Gran Fondo New York had two doping\ncases last year, its first for drug tests. This year, winners\nwill collect a total of $50,000 in  prizes , including an $8,000\nbicycle, and the continued drug tests are drawing support from\nparticipants. It costs $190-$300 to enter.  \u201cThis is a competitive race from start to finish and if\nyou\u2019re going for the prize, you should fully expect to be\ntested,\u201d said Brian Lee, a 40-year-old  Morgan Stanley (MS)  high-yield bond salesman, who is training for July\u2019s Ironman\ntriathlon in Lake Placid, New York. \u201cIntegrity is important.\u201d  Two Dopers  Last year,  David Anthony  of the U.S. and Gabriele Guarini\nof  Italy  tested positive for banned substances. Anthony had won\nthe 45-49 age division before a test revealed his use of blood-boosting erythropoietin, or EPO. Guarini won the 50-54 men\u2019s\ncategory and tested positive for oxygen-enhancing peptide\nhormone use, according to USADA\u2019s website. Both got two-year\nbans and had their results erased. Neither responded to e-mail\nrequests for comment.  Anthony and Guarini joined a growing  list  of amateur\nathletes to test positive for doping. Since 2011, at least 10\namateur cyclists have been cited for doping infractions in the\nU.S., according to USADA. Anthony\u2019s name appears three spots\nbelow Armstrong\u2019s on USADA\u2019s banned list.  48 States  The gran fondo, which this year has attracted cyclists from\n48 U.S. states and 70 countries, was founded by Fluhme, 38, and\nhis wife, Lidia Fluhme, 32, a former Wall Street investment\nbanker with firms including Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank AG.\nThe couple said they used their own savings to fund the race in\nits first year and spend about $500,000 for permits to secure\nthe route. The Fluhmes said they didn\u2019t test for doping in the\ninaugural race due to the high costs. Testing began last year.  He wouldn\u2019t disclose how much he has spent on the race or\nwhether it will be profitable.  Doping tests at the gran fondo help the Fluhmes protect\ntheir investment, Uli Fluhme said in a telephone interview. They\nwouldn\u2019t disclose the number of tests that will be done.  \u201cIf you put on a race, make it a competition, put up\nprizes and people come from all over the world to compete and\nyou don\u2019t do testing, it\u2019s like you are allowing doping,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of what you have to do to provide fair\nracing. Of course it\u2019s sad. But it\u2019s the reality. It\u2019s better\nthan just ignoring it.\u201d  Doping Scandals  While professional cycling has been plagued by doping\nscandals since the 1960s, a surge in recreational riders is\nincreasing drug use among amateurs, said Andrew Tilin, who was\nbanned for two years by USADA in 2011 for testosterone use as\npart of research for his book, \u201cThe Doper Next Door: My Strange\nand Scandalous Year on Performance-Enhancing Drugs.\u201d  \u201cThe culture has just trickled down,\u201d Tilin, 47, said in\na telephone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s pathetic, frankly. Who are we\nreally impressing? We\u2019re racing for PowerBars, tires and passes\nto amusement parks.\u201d  Fresh off his ban, Tilin finished 10th in the Masters B\nclass at the  Tour of the Gila  four-day stage race in  New Mexico \non May 5.  \u201cI\u2019m staring at a check for $13,\u201d Tilin said of his\nprize.  The U.S. bicycle industry had sales of $6 billion in 2011,\nup 13 percent from $5.3 billion in 2002, according to the\n National Bicycle Dealers Association .  Scenic Tour  During a gran fondo, riders can choose to race for a\nfastest time or just enjoy the scenery and spend time with\nfriends as part of an endurance challenge.  After a 7 a.m. mass start for the May 19 race on the lower\nlevel of the George Washington Bridge, riders head north to Bear\nMountain, New York, and back. The ride finishes in Weehawken,\nNew Jersey, with a 10-hour time limit. Top riders will finish in\nless than six hours.  \u201cThe star is  New York City ,\u201d said Uli Fluhme, who moved\nto New York from Ireland in 2008. The ride has a total of about\n8,500 feet (2,600 meters) of climbing. It\u2019s that elevation that\nthe German-born Fluhme said will probably surprise non-New\nYorkers in the race.  \u201cPeople think of  Manhattan  and say, \u2018How great can the\nriding be here?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get across the bridge\ninto Rockland County (New York), it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s a hard\ncourse. When I moved here, I had no idea.\u201d  Last year\u2019s men\u2019s winner, which was determined by  combined\ntimes  on the course\u2019s four biggest climbs, was Wladimiro\nD\u2019Ascenzo, a former professional cyclist from Italy. Anthony\nFatuzzo of Fair Lawn,  New Jersey , was second.  Team Sport  While the field is limited to amateurs, many compete as\nmembers of organized teams. Like professional races, amateur\nriders work together in groups in an attempt to set their top\nriders up for victory. At the New York event, winning teams are\nalso awarded prizes based on the times of their four fastest\nfinishers.  For some first-time participants, drug testers at the\nfinish line will be a welcome sight.  \u201cI don\u2019t expect to win prize money, but let\u2019s try to keep\nthe playing field honest,\u201d Solomon Rosenzweig, a 38-year-old\nstructural engineer from  Brooklyn , said in a telephone\ninterview. \u201cI kind of hope I get picked just for the novelty of\nit.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nMichael Buteau in Atlanta at \n mbuteau@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nMichael Sillup at \n msillup@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 11.729915618896484 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
