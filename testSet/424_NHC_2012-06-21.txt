The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nStorm forecasters are tracking a\npotential tropical weather system that may spawn heavy rain and\nflooding from the Bahamas and  Florida  to the Cayman Islands.  The disturbance has a 30 percent chance of organizing and\nstrengthening into a tropical depression or storm in the next\ntwo days as it moves northwest into the  Gulf of Mexico , the\n National Hurricane Center  in Miami said.  Two days of heavy rain and local flooding may occur across\nwestern Cuba, southern Florida, the central Bahamas and Yucatan\npeninsula, the NHC said. The center is also monitoring Tropical\nStorm Chris southeast of  Newfoundland , the third named storm of\nthe Atlantic  hurricane season .  Chris was 630 miles (1,010 kilometers) from Cape Race,\nNewfoundland, moving east-northeast at 20 mph, the NHC said in\nits 5 a.m. Atlantic time advisory. Its top winds were 60 mph.\nLittle change in strength is expected with the storm forecast to\nbecome post-tropical by the end of the week.  The two other storms that received names when their winds\nreached 39 mph formed in May, ahead of the official June 1 start\nof the hurricane season. Three storms don\u2019t usually develop in\nthe Atlantic so early,  Jeff Masters , co-founder of Weather\nUnderground Inc., wrote in his blog. In 1887 and 1959, three\nstorms formed before June 20, he said.  A nearly stationary area of low pressure about 330 miles\nsouth of the tip of Mexico\u2019s Baja California is producing\nshowers though it\u2019s only given a 10 percent chance of becoming a\ntropical cyclone over the next two days, the NHC also said.
