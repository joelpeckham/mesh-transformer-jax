 "context": "The following article called 'Google, Christie\u2019s, Apple, Samsung: Intellectual Property' was published on 2012-07-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGoogle Inc. (GOOG)  asked a U.S. court to\ndismiss a lawsuit by authors over the digitizing of books,\nsaying that the company\u2019s book-scanning program is a fair use of\ncopyrighted material and a benefit to the public and authors.  The lawsuit by the Authors Guild, as well as one filed by\nthe American Society of Media Photographers, stems from Google\u2019s\nplan announced in 2004 to scan millions of books from public and\nuniversity libraries to provide snippets of text to people who\nuse its Internet search engine.  In a motion filed July 27 in federal court in New York, the\ncompany seeks dismissal of the Authors Guild\u2019s case, arguing\nthat authors benefit from the project because their books can be\nmore readily found, bought and read, while the public gains\n\u201cincreased knowledge.\u201d Google also argued that the display of\nsnippets of text is fair use under copyright law and that the\nauthors haven\u2019t been harmed by the display.  \u201c Google Books  furthers the objectives of the copyright\nlaws because of the public benefits (including benefits to\nauthors),\u201d the company said in its motion. \u201cPlaintiffs have\nadduced no evidence that Google Books has displaced the sale of\neven a single book.\u201d  Michael Boni, a lawyer for the authors, said July 27 that\nhe was planning to file a sealed motion for a judicial ruling in\ntheir favor, by hand rather than electronically, because \u201cit\nuses a lot of documents Google marked \u2018confidential.\u2019\u201d A\nredacted version will be filed at another time, he said in a\nphone interview.  Oral arguments on both parties\u2019 motions for summary\njudgment are set for Oct. 9.  Last year, a federal judge declined to approve a proposed\n$125 million settlement between the plaintiffs and Google,\nsaying it was \u201can attempt to use the class action mechanism to\nimplement forward-looking business arrangements that go far\nbeyond the dispute before the court.\u201d  Further negotiations between the authors and Google were\nunsuccessful. The publishers remain in talks, Google has said.  The authors\u2019 case is Authors Guild v. Google, 05-08136; the\nvisual artists\u2019 case is American Society of Media Photographers\nv. Google, 10-cv-02977, U.S. District Court, Southern District\nof New York (Manhattan).  Copyright  Megaupload Prosecutors Seek to Keep Company as Defendant  Megaupload Ltd. should remain a defendant in the federal\ncriminal case accusing the  Internet company  and its founder, Kim Dotcom, of running a massive illegal file-sharing service, U.S.\nprosecutors said.  Prosecutors seeking to defeat a request for dismissal said\non July 27 that the U.S. has the authority to bring copyright\ninfringement charges against Megaupload even though the company\nhas no offices in the country.  \u201cThe heart of the issue is whether foreign companies like\nMegaupload can commit crimes in the U.S. and in this district\nand then never be brought to justice,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney\nRyan Dickey told U.S. District Judge Liam O\u2019Grady during a\nhearing in Alexandria, Virginia. \u201cThat just can\u2019t be the case,\nyour honor.\u201d  The dismissal of charges against Megaupload would add to\nthe challenges prosecutors have faced since shutting down the\ncompany\u2019s file-sharing website and charging Dotcom and six other\nindividuals in January. A judge in  New Zealand  last month threw\nout warrants used to seize the Internet entrepreneur\u2019s property,\ndelaying Dotcom\u2019s possible extradition by at least seven months.  Investigators executed more than 20 search warrants in the\nU.S. and eight other countries and seized about $50 million in\nassets in connection with what they said was among the largest\ncriminal copyright cases ever brought by the U.S.  Megaupload operated in the U.S. for more than six years,\nearning more than $175 million in illegal profit since 2005 from\nthe exchange of pirated films, music, books and software,\naccording to an indictment. More than 500 servers leased by\nMegaupload were in Virginia, giving the U.S. jurisdiction to\nprosecute the company, the government argued in court papers.  At the July 27 hearing, lawyers argued over whether federal\nrules governing criminal cases bar indictment of foreign\ncompanies that don\u2019t have offices or agents in the U.S. The\nrules require prosecutors to issue a summons to an agent or\nofficer of the company, and mail a copy to the company\u2019s last\nknown address in the U.S., when bringing criminal charges\nagainst an enterprise.  Megaupload contends prosecutors haven\u2019t tried to serve the\ncompany, which is registered in Hong Kong, and can\u2019t meet the\nrequirements.  By indicting Megaupload, officials were able to shut down\nits operations through criminal forfeiture, seizing domain names\nand freezing assets without any review by a judge, William\nBurck, a lawyer for the company, told O\u2019Grady.  \u201cThe process chosen here illustrates the threat the rule\nwas designed to prevent,\u201d said Burck, a partner at Quinn\nEmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP. \u201cThey wiped out a foreign\ncorporation with no office in the U.S. by bringing a criminal\nindictment.\u201d  The case is U.S. v. Dotcom, 12-00003, U.S. District Court,\nEastern District of Virginia (Alexandria).  For more, click here.  Vekselberg Wins $2.6 Million Fake-Art Case Against Christie\u2019s  Viktor Vekselberg , the billionaire who owns part of a\nRussian oil venture with  BP Plc (BP/) , won a claim to recoup losses\nfrom U.K. auctioneer Christie\u2019s International after paying 1.7\nmillion pounds ($2.6 million) for what he thought was a painting\nby Russian artist Boris Kustodiev.  Judge Guy Newey in London said that the painting was \u201cthe\nwork of someone other than\u201d Kustodiev. As a result, the judge\nsaid, Vekselberg\u2019s  Aurora Fine Arts Investment Ltd.  had the\nright to return the painting \u201cand recover the money it paid.\u201d\nNewey cleared Christie\u2019s of negligence in his written judgment.  \u201cIt is a matter of huge regret to Aurora that it was\nforced to sue Christie\u2019s,\u201d Andrey Shtorkh, Vekselberg\u2019s\nspokesman, said by phone from Moscow July 27. \u201cWe are pleased\nwith the ruling, which confirmed that the experts from Russian\nmuseums were correct in asserting that the painting is not the\nwork of Kustodiev.\u201d  Vekselberg, chairman of Renova Group, has a net worth of\nabout $14 billion, according to data collected by Bloomberg. In\nMarch, he stepped down as chairman of United Co. Rusal, the\nworld\u2019s biggest aluminum maker, citing disputes with co-founder\nOleg Deripaska, including the refusal to sell Rusal\u2019s stake in\nOAO GMK Norilsk Nickel.  \u201cWe are surprised and disappointed by his view of the\npainting\u2019s attribution,\u201d a spokesman for London-based\nChristie\u2019s said in a statement after the ruling. \u201cWe maintain\nour belief in the attribution to Kustodiev and are considering\nour options.\u201d  For more copyright news, click here.  Trademark  Woman Charged in Guggenheim Name Scam Won\u2019t Serve Jail Time  Lady Catarina Pietra Toumei, one of three charged in a\nscheme to use the Guggenheim family name to swindle investors\nthrough phony billion-dollar deals, pleaded guilty to a\nmisdemeanor and was given two years of probation.  Toumei, 46, admitted on July 27 to helping her two co-\ndefendants violate a judge\u2019s order, issued in a civil trademark\nlawsuit, that barred them from using the Guggenheim name. Toumei\nwas sentenced by U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cott in Manhattan.  Prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara\nin Manhattan charged Toumei, Vladimir Zuravel and David Birnbaum\nin January 2011 with a scheme to use the Guggenheim name to lure\ninvestors into fake investments in oil, bank guarantees,\ndiamonds and gold. Charges against Birnbaum, who allegedly used\nthe name \u201cDavid B. Guggenheim,\u201d were dropped in September and\nZuravel was sentenced to a year of probation in April after\npleading guilty.  \u201cI always was surprised that the case was filed,\u201d\nToumei\u2019s lawyer, Jan Ronis, said after the July 27 hearing. \u201cAt\nall times, she truly thought they were Guggenheims.\u201d  The Guggenheim family is descended from  Meyer Guggenheim , a\nSwiss immigrant who made a fortune in mining and smelting in the\n19th century. They are known for charitable giving, including\nthe establishment of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New\nYork.  Ronis said Toumei, who lives in the San Diego area, met\nZuravel and Birnbaum on the Internet and had never seen them in\nperson.  Ellen Davis , a spokeswoman for Bharara\u2019s office, declined\nto comment on the case.  The case is U.S. v. Toumei, 11-Mag.-207, U.S. District\nCourt, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

(005930) , having waged their\npatent battle on four continents, are now on a collision course\nin California with little prospect of a settlement before a  jury\ntrial  set to begin this week.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, who practiced as\nan  intellectual-property  litigator in Silicon Valley for eight\nyears, is scheduled to start jury selection today. Jurors will\ndecide each company\u2019s claims that its rival infringed patents\ncovering designs and technology for mobile devices, with\npotential damage awards reaching billions of dollars.  The companies have sued each other in the U.K., Australia,\nand South Korea, among other countries, in a bid for dominance\nof a mobile-device market that Bloomberg Industries said was\n$312 billion last year. In San Jose, Apple seeks damages of $2.5\nbillion based on claims Samsung copied the iPhone and iPad. The\nCupertino, California-based company also wants to make permanent\na preliminary ban it won on U.S. sales of a Samsung tablet\ncomputer, and extend the ban to Samsung smartphones.  \u201cEventually all the parties to the smartphone wars will\nhave to settle,\u201d  Mark Lemley , a Stanford Law School professor,\nsaid in an e-mail. \u201cBut the parties have fought this one long\nand hard, and I don\u2019t see why they would settle now, with an\ninjunction already in place. I expect them to take their chances\nat trial.\u201d  Claiming Apple is infringing two patents covering mobile-\ntechnology standards and three utility patents, Samsung is\ndemanding royalties of as much as 2.4 percent for each device\nsold.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-\ncv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California\n(San Jose).  For more, click here.  U.K. IP Lawsuits Almost Triple on Smartphone Patent Disputes  U.K. courts are a battleground for the global technology\npatent wars as intellectual property claims almost tripled last\nyear, according to a report by law firm EMW Law LLP.  There were 183 new patent and registered design claims\nfiled in the U.K. in 2011, the most in more than five years, as\nfirms seek to maintain their advantage over competitors in a\ndifficult economic climate, EMW said. There were 65 similar\nclaims filed in 2010.  \u201cSome technology businesses have amassed a huge war chest\nof patents, which they can use to swamp the competition with\npatent infringement claims,\u201d said Mark Finn, IP law principal\nat EMW. \u201cEven if the claim doesn\u2019t stick and is eventually\nrejected by the courts, it can still keep rivals\u2019 products off\nthe market for long enough to gain a competitive advantage.\u201d  Smartphone makers including Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics\nCo.,  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and  HTC Corp. (2498)  have filed dozens of suits against\neach other in the U.K. during the past two years as part of a\nglobal litigation strategy in the mobile-device market that\nBloomberg Industries said was $312 billion last year. The rise\nin IP litigation comes as the U.K. economy shrank the most in\nthree years, forcing companies to fight \u201cfor every edge they\ncan find,\u201d Finn said.  Companies in patent-heavy industries look for \u201cany way\u201d\nto maintain their advantage, Finn said.  Finn said companies rush to sue before the disputed product\nestablishes itself in the country, because U.K. patent courts\nmay take a year to reach a judgment.  For more patent news, click here.  Internet  Google\u2019s Failure Over Street View Data May Breach U.K. Accord  Google Inc. may have breached an agreement with the U.K.\nprivacy regulator by failing to delete personal data gathered\nthrough its Street View service.  Google contacted the U.K. Information Commissioner\u2019s Office\non July 27  to say  it still had some data that should have been\ndeleted in December 2010, the agency said in a statement the\nsame day. The watchdog said it\u2019s in touch with other data\nprotection regulators in Europe \u201cto coordinate the response to\nthis development.\u201d  \u201cThe fact that some of this information still exists\nappears to breach the undertaking to the ICO signed by Google in\nNovember 2010,\u201d the agency said in the statement. \u201cOur\nresponse, which has already been issued, makes clear that Google\nmust supply the data to the ICO immediately, so that we can\nsubject it to forensic analysis before deciding on the necessary\ncourse of action.\u201d  Google was fined $25,000 by the  U.S. Federal Communications\nCommission  this year for impeding its investigation into\nimproper data gathering. In an agreement ending the U.K. inquiry\ninto Street View in November 2010,  Mountain View , California-\nbased Google agreed to further ICO audits of its privacy\npractices. One was published in August 2011 and will be reviewed\nthis year to ensure ICO recommendations were followed.  In June, the U.K. regulator re-opened a probe into the data\ncollected through Google\u2019s location service. While Street View\ncars photograph buildings and homes to provide street-level\nmapping to Google users, they went beyond that by using wireless\nconnections to gather people\u2019s personal communications.  Google still has in its possession \u201ca small portion of\npayload data collected\u201d by its Street View cars in the U.K.,\n Peter Fleischer , the company\u2019s global privacy counsel, said in\nthe letter. \u201cGoogle apologizes for this error.\u201d  Music  Universal Said to Offer Sale of EMI Classics, Parlophone  Vivendi SA (VIV) \u2019s Universal Music Group offered European\nregulators to dispose of local assets that may fetch more than\n250 million euros ($309 million) to soothe antitrust concerns\nover its takeover of EMI Group\u2019s recorded-music business, said\none person familiar with the matter.  Universal offered to sell Parlophone Records, home to\nColdplay and Gorillaz, in the U.K. while keeping the label\u2019s\nBeatles songs, the person said, declining to be identified as\nthe matter is not public. The company would also sell some\nlabels including EMI Classics and Virgin Classics in Europe and\nEMI\u2019s units in France, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland,\nPortugal, Norway and Sweden to get approval for the 1.2 billion-\npound ($1.9 billion) deal, the person said.  Universal Music, the world\u2019s largest record company, on\nJuly 27 said it submitted a package of concessions to European\nUnion regulators. Universal has a list of about 20 entities,\nranging from independent music labels to major rivals such as\nSony Music Entertainment and Bertelsmann AG\u2019s BMG Rights\nManagement LLC, which have indicated interest for assets\npotentially up for sale, according to two people familiar with\nthe process.  \u201cWe believe the package fully addresses the commission\u2019s\nconcerns and follows our constructive discussions with\nregulators, independent labels and competitors,\u201d Universal said\nin an e-mailed statement, adding that it\u2019s \u201cconfident of\nreceiving clearance.\u201d  The offer will now be circulated to third-party record\nlabels and customers for so-called market testing.  A Universal representative declined to comment on details\nof the concessions. A representative for BMG declined to comment\nand Sony\u2019s representatives couldn\u2019t be immediately reached for\ncomment.  Universal on July 27 also offered to sell the Virgin\nClassics label in Europe and the British catalog of Pink Floyd.\nA sale of Chrysalis Records wouldn\u2019t include songs by  Robbie Williams , the person said.
