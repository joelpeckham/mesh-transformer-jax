 "context": "The following article called 'Singapore Billionaire Family Bets on Hotels, Plans REIT Listing' was published on 2012-09-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRB Capital , which is bidding for 42\nMarriott hotels in the U.K., is seeking to acquire other assets\nin Europe and expand in Southeast  Asia  as it prepares to list a\nhospitality trust in Singapore.  \u201cWe are accumulating assets, we are bulking up,\u201d Kishin\nRK, chief executive officer of Singapore-based property company,\nsaid in an interview. \u201cWe are waiting for the right time to go\nout to the markets; we have a sizeable amount of development\npipeline under construction.\u201d  The 29-year-old developer is betting on gains in tourism as\nSingapore has attracted about a million  visitors  a month since\n2010, when its two casinos opened, and as more budget airlines\nfly to the city-state. Shares of  Far East Hospitality Trust (FEHT)  and\n Ascendas Hospitality Trust (ASHT)  have gained since their initial stock\nsales in the country this year.  \u201cHospitality REITs have done phenomenally well here,\u201d\nKishin said. \u201cThe market is looking for more products.\u201d  RB Capital plans to list its hospitality trust in the next\ntwo years, once the hotels that it\u2019s developing generate a\nstable  cash flow , Kishin said.  Kishin, who is building about 1,300 hotel rooms in\nSingapore and  Kuala Lumpur , is betting on growing demand for\ninternational chains by budget-conscious travelers. He will open\nnext year a 460-room hotel in Singapore and another 210-room\nproperty in Kuala Lumpur under the Holiday Inn Express brand.  Budget Travel  \u201cBudget travel in the last 24 months has increased\nsubstantially,\u201d he said. \u201cIn three to five years, you\u2019re going\nto see a peak in  Southeast Asia .\u201d  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  responded to the rising demand for\ndiscount carriers by starting budget long-haul operator Scoot\nthis year. Jetstar, the budget arm of  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) , is\nbuilding up a network of low-cost carriers across Asia.  Kishin set up RB Capital\u2019s hospitality business in 2010\nafter he struggled to find an international hotel in Singapore\nthat charged between S$150 ($122) and S$190 a night.  \u201cWe saw a vacuum that was not filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\nnext category down are local brands which foreigners may not be\nable to relate to in terms of  brand recognition .\u201d  Singapore had the highest average daily hotel room rate in\nAsia in the first half of this year after  Hong Kong , according\nto a CBRE Group Inc.  report  in August. The average daily rate in\nSingapore was at $230, bolstered by visitor arrivals into the\ncity-state, CBRE said.  The hotels that RB Capital is developing will appeal to\nbudget-conscious travelers from Asia, said Nicholas Mak,\n executive director  at SLP International Property Consultants, a\nreal estate consulting company. \u201cThe outlook for this segment\nis bright,\u201d he said.  Little India  The developer, which acquired a hotel site above a train\nstation in Singapore\u2019s Little India district after making a\nrecord bid in April, plans to announce at least one more hotel\nproject in the \u201cnear future,\u201d Kishin said. RB Capital offered\nS$1,078.80 a square foot based on how much space it could build\non the site, beating nine other bidders, including Far East\nOrganization,  Singapore \u2019s biggest closely held developer.  Kishin plans to grow RB Capital\u2019s assets to S$5 billion in\nthree years, from about S$3 billion, he said, without specifying\nhow much debt the company has. The company, which plans to\nexpand in Indonesia and Thailand, currently has about S$1 \nbillion in hotel assets, he said.  \u201cFor us to go out to market and for a REIT structure to\nmake sense, we would need at least S$1 billion in assets\ntoday,\u201d he said. \u201cMoving forward as the REIT market in\nSingapore develops, size would play an important role; we\ncontinue with our acquisition plans moving ahead.\u201d  Marriott Hotels  RB Capital has been in the running for the Marriott\nproperties being offered by Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in\nthe last nine months, one of a few deals the developer is\npursuing in  Europe , Kishin said.  RBS, Britain\u2019s largest publicly held lender following its\n2008 bailout, has been seeking a buyer for the U.K. hotels\nmanaged by  Marriott International Inc. (MAR)  to recover 700 million\npounds ($1.1 billion) after the borrowers defaulted a year ago.\nErfan Hussain, a spokesman for RBS, declined to comment in an e-\nmail about RB Capital\u2019s bid.  \u201cIf you\u2019re focused on Singapore, it\u2019s a highly competitive\nmarket because every developer is looking to buy ready-made\nassets here,\u201d Kishin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why we\u2019ve\nstarted to look at Europe.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nNetty Ismail in Singapore \n nismail3@bloomberg.net .
