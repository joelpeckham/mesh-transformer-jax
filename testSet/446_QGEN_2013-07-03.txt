The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSix days after police in  China  began\nan investigation into GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the U.K.\u2019s biggest\ndrugmaker still has no details on the probe, a spokesman said.  Senior executives at Glaxo China are suspected of\n\u201ceconomic crimes\u201d and are being investigated by Changsha\npublic security officials, the city\u2019s police force said June 28\non its official blog, without elaborating.  Simon Steel, a Glaxo spokesman in  London , repeated\nyesterday that the company is unclear of the precise nature or\npurpose of the investigation, which began June 27. \u201cThere is\nnothing further to add to that,\u201d Steel said today in an e-mail.  State-run  China Daily  said  today  the probe raises concerns\nabout ongoing corruption in the country\u2019s drug industry, which\nis the world\u2019s fastest-growing pharmaceutical market according\nto consulting firm  IMS Health Inc . The situation may also signal\na wider scope for investigations as China tries to rein in\ncorruption.  \u201cHistorically the focus of the Chinese government had been\non government officials receiving bribes,\u201d said  Kim Nemirow , a\nHong Kong-based partner at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP. \u201cMore\nrecently the scope has expanded to those individuals who are\ngiving bribes to government officials.\u201d  Chinese authorities have stepped up enforcement of bribery\nand corruption since President Xi Jinping took office last\nNovember, Nemirow said.  Open Secret  \u201cIt would be a wrong decision for any company to stop\ninvesting in or even leave China\u201d due to the stricter\nregulations, said  Qiagen NV (QGEN)  Chief Financial Officer Roland Sackers in a  Shanghai  interview today. \u201cNot just because of the\nsales growth, but also because of the skills of the scientists\nyou can find here.\u201d  Today\u2019s  China Daily  article mentioned the case of Zheng Xiaoyu, the former head of China\u2019s  State Food and Drug\nAdministration , who was executed in 2007 after his conviction\nfor taking bribes and approving dangerous medicines.  At the time of Zheng\u2019s execution, 38 multinational\ndrugmakers announced their intention to resist commercial\ncorruption. Yet, bribing of doctors by pharmaceutical companies\nis still an \u201copen secret,\u201d according to the newspaper, which\ncited unidentified people working in the industry.  A senior Glaxo finance executive in Shanghai and employees\nin Beijing were detained as part of a corruption investigation,\nthe  South China Morning Post  said July 1, citing an unidentified\nperson from Shanghai\u2019s drug industry.
