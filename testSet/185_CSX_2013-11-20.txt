 "context": "The following article called 'Global Economy in 2014 Needs Successes in Washington: Year Ahead' was published on 2013-11-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nOn Jan. 1, Latvia will adopt the euro, and its lats currency will be no more. Farewell to the bearded Krisjanis Barons, the collector of folk songs who graces the 100-latu note. The Baltic nation is shucking a piece of its heritage because its leaders predict joining Europe\u2019s common currency zone will lead to more trade and prosperity.  There aren\u2019t many other events in 2014 that can be forecast with as much confidence as Latvia\u2019s scheduled adoption of the euro. For decision-makers in global business, some big unknowns await: Will the U.S. economy add jobs or asset bubbles with  Janet Yellen  running the Federal Reserve? Will German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  become more generous toward Southern Europe? Can Chinese President  Xi Jinping  and Premier  Li Keqiang  repair the slowing engines of the world\u2019s second-largest economy?  Can Shinzo Abe , Japan\u2019s prime minister, shrink budget deficits?  Those are among the economic and geopolitical ideas being explored starting today at The Year Ahead: 2014, a two-day conference in Chicago hosted by Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News and Bloomberg Businessweek. Wrestling with the hardest questions of the day can help executives make decisions about where and when to deploy people and capital.  Worldwide, 2014 should be better than 2013 but not great. Inflation and interest rates are low in most of the world, oil prices are predicted to fall, companies have cash and there\u2019s pent-up consumer demand. A Barclays measure of global business confidence reached a 31-month high in October, and the  Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index  is running at the highest level in record dating to 1994.  Low Gear  Even so, the world is having trouble accelerating after the 2009 worldwide slump. The International Monetary Fund projects global growth in gross domestic product of 3.6 percent in 2014. While that\u2019s up from 2.9 percent this year, it isn\u2019t back to the 5 percent growth rates of 2005 to 2007.  \u201cGlobal growth is in low gear, the drivers of activity are changing, and downside risks persist,\u201d the organization reported in October.  The best place to start the tour d\u2019horizon is Washington.  The U.S. is the world\u2019s largest economy, and two of the most important global questions involve the Fed and Congress. One is whether Congress and the White House can reach deals with a minimum of fuss in January and February to fund the federal government and raise the debt ceiling; the other is whether Yellen can taper stimulus measures as adroitly as current Chairman  Ben Bernanke  layered them on.  Success in both missions could lift 2014 growth in the U.S. above the middling 2.6 percent rate foreseen by economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Failure would hurt the U.S. and reverberate worldwide.  \u2018Growth Engine\u2019  \u201cWhat we should be mainly focused on is, how do we get the growth engine back,\u201d  Austan Goolsbee , a professor at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business and former chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said last month on \u201cThe Charlie Rose Show\u201d on PBS and Bloomberg Television. He\u2019s scheduled to speak at the conference today.  One optimist is Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard , who said at the conference today that U.S. economic growth may accelerate to 3 percent or more in 2014. The U.S. housing market has improved in the last 18 months and Europe is coming out of a recession, he said.  \u201cThat will help the global situation,\u201d Bullard said. \u201cThe right assessment of 2014 is still to be optimistic.\u201d  Bullard said he doesn\u2019t favor lowering the unemployment threshold at which the central bank would consider raising interest rates. Since December, the Federal Open Market Committee has said it would hold its target interest rate near zero as long as unemployment remained above 6.5 percent, so long as the outlook for inflation didn\u2019t rise above 2.5 percent.  Unemployment Threshold  If the Fed were to lower the unemployment threshold, Bullard said, \u201cthen how much credibility do you have for the threshold?\u201d  Even with the U.S. emerging as one of the world\u2019s low-cost manufacturing centers, politicians could still mess things up by keeping executives guessing, said  Harold Sirkin , a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group.  \u201cThe thing that business hates the most, maybe after taxes, is uncertainty,\u201d Sirkin said. Companies aren\u2019t investing and \u201cthey don\u2019t want to hire people. If you tell them what the rules of the game are, they\u2019re more likely to respond.\u201d  One path forward goes like this: Fiscal policy becomes less of a drag in 2014. Republicans approve a debt-ceiling increase in February in exchange for some hard-to-predict concession from the White House. By spring, President  Barack Obama  wins continuing resolutions replacing some scheduled budget caps and sequestration with smaller cuts in other areas. In the November 2014 elections, the GOP loses seats but retains control of the House.  Entitlement Spending  Divided government means less contraction because the Republicans can\u2019t win big spending cuts and the Democrats can\u2019t get tax increases. There\u2019s little progress, though, on restraining the long-term growth in entitlement spending.  Over at the Fed on Constitution Avenue, Yellen will face anguishing decisions as soon as she replaces Bernanke as Fed chairman on Feb. 1, assuming she wins confirmation. Years of near-zero interest rates and aggressive Fed bond-buying have failed to engender strong economic growth. Monetary hawks say easy money will create bubbles in assets ranging from housing (again) to farmland to junk bonds.  The Fed is near a tipping point at which stimulus becomes \u201can agent of financial recklessness,\u201d and \u201cnone of us really know where that tipping point is,\u201d  Richard Fisher , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in October. In 2014, Fisher becomes a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee -- and a thorn in Yellen\u2019s side.  Bubble Risk  Bubbles are only one risk. The expansion could lose what little momentum it has next year if Yellen, to prove her inflation-fighting bona fides, goes along with premature withdrawal of stimulus. The decline of the unemployment rate since 2009, to 7.3 percent in October, is misleading because it\u2019s largely the result of people giving up and not being counted among the unemployed, said  Scott Clemons , chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman Wealth Management.  If the expansion since the last recession ended in June 2009 is still intact next summer, the run of growth, modest as it is, will have lasted longer than the average since World War II. To keep it alive, said one investor, it\u2019s almost as likely the Fed will increase stimulus as that it will finally begin its long-anticipated taper.  \u201cLow demand for credit, low inflation and other indicators are signaling that deflation remains a serious threat,\u201d  Daniel Arbess , a partner in the investment and advisory firm Perella Weinberg Partners, wrote in an e-mail.  World\u2019s Central Bank  The Fed\u2019s next move matters to everyone because it remains the world\u2019s de facto central bank. Other nations complained when low U.S. rates sent hot money flooding their way in 2008, and they complained again this year when hints of higher U.S. rates reversed the tide.  Yellen won\u2019t focus too much on that turmoil; serving the U.S. economy is complicated enough. The central bank will start tapering the monthly pace of bond buying by $70 billion around March, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Even so, the Fed\u2019s own rate setters don\u2019t foresee nudging up the federal funds rate until 2015, because the U.S. economy remains too weak to withstand it.  Port Expansion  All of which argues for caution. At the sprawling  Port of Long Beach , California, work is proceeding on a $4 billion expansion that by 2019 will increase capacity by one-third. Port officials aren\u2019t so bullish about the coming year -- they\u2019re projecting only 3 percent volume growth for Long Beach and the neighboring Port of Los Angeles combined, the same as this year.  \u201cWe see no clear sign that the recovery is picking up steam in the immediate future,\u201d said Noel Hacegaba, the port\u2019s chief operating officer.  China, the world\u2019s No. 2 economy, won\u2019t grow at its customary pace in 2014, either. Western drugmakers, whose Chinese sales rose 40 percent a year as recently as 2011, might have to settle for 14 percent to 15 percent growth next year, estimates London-based GlobalData.  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg are looking for China\u2019s deceleration to continue in the year ahead, with growth of 7.4 percent, down from 7.6 percent this year. While that may look boringly steady, the seeming ability of China\u2019s leadership to hit its targets masks economic and political volatility.  \u201cNothing in China is as it appears,\u201d said  Gary Burnison , chief executive officer of recruiting company Korn/Ferry International. Burnison, who lived in Shanghai this past summer, is scheduled to speak at the conference later today.  Plenary Meetings  To judge whether President Xi and Premier Li are gaining the upper hand, keep an eye on a few key events in 2014, advises David Hoffman, who lives in Beijing as managing director of the Conference Board\u2019s  China Center for Economics and Business . One is the 12th National People\u2019s Congress\u2019s plenary meeting in March. The other is a plenary session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, probably in September or October.  While Li wants to move China from investment to consumption as a source of growth, the pop in growth this fall was achieved the old-fashioned way -- by heavy lending that fueled investment in plants, equipment and infrastructure. The municipality of Beijing, for example, is planning a financial district with 80 skyscrapers, even though its existing Financial Street is only about 15 years old.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing tremendous inertia on the reform front, and the factional divides are very pronounced,\u201d Hoffman said.  China looks considerably healthier to  Michael Silverstein , who, like Sirkin, is a Boston Consulting Group senior partner.  300 Bureaucrats  \u201cThere are 300 bureaucrats that basically run China as a meritocracy,\u201d he said. They\u2019re already starting work on the next Five-Year Plan, which will cover 2016 to 2020. \u201cIt\u2019ll just blow you away,\u201d Silverstein said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to get highly specific about the technologies they really want to try to own.\u201d Corruption? \u201cThe current government is very intent on knocking that out,\u201d he said.  On currencies, one piece of good news is that imbalances in global trade have been shrinking. American deficits and Chinese surpluses have fallen dramatically since 2007. But even that positive development will cause unnerving reverberations in 2014, predicts  Stephen King , HSBC\u2019s global head of economics and asset allocation.  Hot Money  The recently dubbed Fragile Five -- Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey -- became addicted to inflows of hot money caused in part by the Fed\u2019s easy monetary policy. They ran up trade deficits. Now those deficits are getting smaller, which is healthy in the long run. But they\u2019re dwindling too rapidly and in a sickly way, i.e., through currency depreciation that makes imports unaffordable and through high interest rates that chill demand, King said.  Mathematically, if the Fragile Five are reducing their deficits, some other countries must run bigger deficits or smaller surpluses. If they don\u2019t want to, the risk is a beggar-thy-neighbor currency war.  A big question for 2014: Which country will break out of a mercantilist mindset and accept smaller surpluses? China is moving slowly toward an overall balance in trade despite its huge surplus versus the U.S.  Then come Japan and Germany. Japan\u2019s Abe is in a pickle. He needs to boost growth but can\u2019t afford a big stimulus and is promising a sales tax hike in April. So Abe is counting on igniting growth through higher inflation. That weakens the yen, which suppresses imports.  Weaker Yen  \u201cIt is hard to see any solution to Japan\u2019s problems that does not involve a significantly weaker yen,\u201d  Julian Jessop , chief international economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note to investors.  That leaves Germany, which has run large trade surpluses throughout the European crisis. While Merkel won election to a third four-year term as chancellor in September, her Christian Democratic Union party failed to garner enough votes to form a government by itself. Her most likely partner is the more Eurocentric Social Democratic Party. European growth could accelerate in 2014 if a new German coalition government provides more financial aid to the rest of Europe and agrees to contribute more to recapitalizing weak banks in Spain and Italy.  \u201cThis is not far-fetched,\u201d said  Andre Sapir , an economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank. \u201cGermany doesn\u2019t want to go for the major clash and the end of the euro.\u201d  On the other hand, ordinary Germans aren\u2019t feeling a lot of gemutlichkeit -- warm fuzzies -- toward the people of Southern Europe, whom some describe as freeloaders.  Populist Backlash  Conservative Germans say that if they make life too easy for Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain, the pressure on them to reform will be removed. If Germany gets too hard-nosed, though, its policies could intensify a populist backlash in debtor nations. A key event to watch is the elections to the European Parliament in May, where anti-European parties threaten a strong showing.  A surprise rate cut by the European Central Bank on Nov. 7 should boost growth. On balance, Sapir is mildly optimistic: \u201cI would see 2014 as a year of transition. But hopefully not a wasted year of transition.\u201d  Once you get past the world\u2019s top four economies, you\u2019re down to countries that are not fully masters of their own fates.  German Cues  The rest of Europe takes its cue from Germany, although Britain, France and Italy are players, too. The economies of Russia and the Middle East depend on energy prices. Africa, primarily a commodity producer, lives and dies by the swings in prices of raw materials. Ditto for most of South America, although Brazil is a major manufacturer as well.  Southeast Asia and Australia are in China\u2019s orbit, while Canada and Mexico depend on the U.S. India is big but insular. Then there are the trouble spots that could blow up in 2014 --or not: the South China Sea, Kashmir, Yemen and so on.  The U.S. matters the most of all. If it grows, the world will, too. In the eastern U.S., railroad CSX Corp. is running more trains laden with housing construction materials, cars and even crude oil from North Dakota.  \u201cWe are feeling more optimistic,\u201d CEO  Mike Ward  said. Looking at some of the broad indicators in the economy, \u201cwe\u2019re really seeing some positive signs.\u201d  If more CEOs climb on board Ward\u2019s optimism train, 2014 could be a strong year after all.
