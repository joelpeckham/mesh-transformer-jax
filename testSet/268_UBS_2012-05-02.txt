 "context": "The following article called 'UBS CEO Ermotti to Tackle Investor Pay Complaints at AGM' was published on 2012-05-02. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nUBS AG (UBSN)  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  pledged to address the concerns of investors planning to\nvote against the remuneration policy of  Switzerland \u2019s biggest\nbank at its annual general meeting in Zurich tomorrow.  \u201cThe reality is that we really need to keep up the\ndialogue with shareholders and listen to what they have to say\nand understand their concerns and address them to the maximum\nway possible,\u201d Ermotti said today in a Bloomberg television\ninterview.  Some investors plan to vote against UBS\u2019s pay proposals\nbecause the Zurich-based bank\u2019s board uses too much discretion,\nrather than performance-related criteria, to decide bonuses. UBS\ncut its 2011 bonus pool by 40 percent to 2.6 billion Swiss\nfrancs ($2.8 billion) as profit dropped 45 percent after a $2.3\nbillion loss from unauthorized trading in September.  \u201cWe\u2019re voting against the remuneration report,\u201d said\nGeorge  Dallas , London-based head of corporate governance at F&C\nManagement Ltd. \u201cThey funded a bonus we thought was excessive\ngiven their performance. The fraud incident demonstrated\nweaknesses in their controls.\u201d  Shareholder scrutiny into compensation for top managers is\nincreasing. Citigroup Inc. shareholders rejected the bank\u2019s\nexecutive pay plan on April 18 amid criticism it lets CEO Vikram Pandit collect millions of dollars in rewards too easily.\nBarclays Plc CEO  Robert Diamond  will forgo about 11 percent of\nhis total paycheck if he fails to meet profitability goals after\ninvestors opposed his package.  Bonuses Too High  Ethos, a Geneva-based foundation that owns UBS stock and\nadvises other institutional shareholders, and ISS, a  New York- \nbased adviser to 1,300 firms, are objecting to the Swiss bank\u2019s\npay proposals for the second consecutive year.  \u201cVariable compensation for top executives is too high,\u201d\nsaid Vinzenz Mathys, a spokesman for  Ethos . \u201cIt\u2019s important to\ngive a very clear signal to the board by voting no.\u201d  UBS revamped its compensation system in late 2008. The\nchanges implemented then included the introduction of claw-back\nprovisions to allow taking back parts of bonuses for certain\nexecutives and staff in the years after the award. The bank also\nmade fixed salaries a bigger part of total pay.  \u201cWe do understand that shareholders are not happy about\nwhat happened in the last couple of years,\u201d said Ermotti, who\njoined UBS last April and took over as CEO after  Oswald Gruebel \nresigned. Ermotti received 6.35 million francs last year,\nincluding a 4.6 million-franc bonus, 88 percent of which was\ndeferred into future years.  Restoring Reputation  Kaspar Villiger, who plans to step down as UBS chairman\ntomorrow, said on April 18 that the bank will base Ermotti\u2019s\nbonus in part on the progress he makes in restoring the firm\u2019s\nreputation. Compensation will be based on a number of\nqualitative as well as performance-based criteria, and client\nand staff satisfaction will also play a role, Villiger said.  About 27 percent of Barclays\u2019s shareholders and 32 percent\nof Credit Suisse Group AG investors last week voted against the\ncompanies\u2019 remuneration plans. About 32 percent of UBS\nshareholders last year voted against the company\u2019s compensation\nreport in a consultative vote.  UBS reported a 54 percent decline in first-quarter profit\nearlier today after a charge related to the company\u2019s own debt\nled to a loss at the investment bank.
