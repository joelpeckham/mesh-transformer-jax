 "context": "The following article called 'Apple Spurs Record $1.24 Trillion Company Cash, Moody\u2019s Says' was published on 2012-03-14. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc. (AAPL) , the world\u2019s most\nvaluable business, led U.S. corporations in amassing a record\n$1.24 trillion of cash last year as memories of the 2008 credit\ncrisis linger, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service.  Excluding Apple, with $97.6 billion of cash and no\noutstanding debt, the figure was relatively unchanged at $1.15\ntrillion, even as revenue and cash flow from operations rose to\na record, Moody\u2019s analysts led by  Richard Lane  said in a report\nyesterday. Investment-grade companies graded A3 or higher by\nMoody\u2019s hold $594.3 billion, or 54 percent, Moody\u2019s said in the\nreport, which tracked cash and liquid investments for non-\nfinancials.  \u201cTreasurers have distinct memories of capital markets\nclosing very quickly, and I think companies in general are more\nfocused on controlling their fate from a funding standpoint and\npart of that means being able to internally fund your investment\nneeds,\u201d Lane said in a telephone interview. Still, \u201cthere\u2019s a\nlarge and growing use of the cash that these companies generated\nover the last handful of years.\u201d  The biggest U.S. nonfinancial corporations maintained\nfortress balance sheets last year as the U.S. economic recovery\nwavered and European policy makers struggled to contain the\nsovereign-debt crisis. Companies increased  capital expenditures ,\ndividend payments, share buybacks and acquisition spending, even\nafter posting record revenue of $10.4 trillion and  cash flow \nfrom operations of $1.3 trillion, according to Moody\u2019s.  Record-Low Costs  Companies, including financial borrowers, sold $1.1\ntrillion of U.S. dollar-denominated debt last year, enticed by\nrecord-low borrowing costs spurred by the  Federal Reserve \nleaving  interest rates  in a target range of zero to 0.25\npercent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u201cCompanies have availed themselves of the low interest\nrates this year or last year to either refinance debt or bring\ndebt into their  capital structure  for the first time,\u201d Lane\nsaid. \u201cTaken together with the economic environment modest as\nit was, even with increasing levels of cash outlays for research\nand development, capex, dividends, buybacks and acquisitions, it\nstill resulted in companies growing aggregate levels of cash.\u201d  Moody\u2019s, which tracked those figures through the third\nquarter of 2011, excluded Cupertino, California-based Apple,\n Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  and EMC Corp. from the cash flow data and net debt\nfigures because they don\u2019t rate the companies, Lane said.  Dividend Payments  Capital expenditures , or funds used for activities from\nrepairing a roof to building a new factory, rose to $714\nbillion, the highest since 2008, accounting for the biggest use\nof cash from operations, the analysts said in the report.\nAcquisition spending followed with $329 billion, while dividend\npayments rose to $284 billion and share buybacks increased to\n$194 billion.  Spending is likely to be about the same this year, as\nMoody\u2019s anticipates growth of 2.9 percent in G-20 economies from\n3.1 percent last year, according to the report.  Moody\u2019s estimates that companies hold almost $700 billion\nof the cash, or 57 percent, overseas and are unlikely to pay\nhefty taxes to repatriate it.  The increased liquidity on company balance sheets is good\nfor credit, because it protects corporations if  capital markets \nare disrupted, according to the report.  Investment-grade corporate bonds have returned 10.2 percent\nsince the end of 2010 as cash holdings have increased, according\nto Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Speculative-grade\nbonds have gained 9.8 percent in that time.
