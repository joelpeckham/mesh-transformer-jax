 "context": "The following article called 'FDIC\u2019s Norton Wants to Revise Basel III Leverage for Banks' was published on 2013-02-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. banks should have to meet a\nstricter leverage ratio than that outlined in the Basel III\ninternational agreement, said  Jeremiah Norton , a board member of\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  The regulatory agencies considering capital rules,\nincluding the FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nand Federal Reserve, should consider minimum leverage ratios\nbased on tangible common equity against bank assets not weighted\nfor risk, Norton said in a  speech  today in Orlando, Florida. The\nratio should be higher than the earlier Basel III proposal for\nthe Tier 1 capital ratio, he said.  \u201cThere is growing empirical evidence that a leverage ratio\nbased on total assets is a better predictor of bank distress\nthan a risk-based capital ratio,\u201d as outlined in the Basel\nproposal, Norton said.  Fellow Republican board member  Thomas Hoenig  had previously\nadvocated scrapping the Basel approach and simplifying the\nbanks\u2019 leverage ratios, calling for a rule based on the ratio of\ntangible equity to tangible assets.  A Basel III rule proposed by the U.S. regulators in June\ncalled for U.S. banks to maintain a core capital buffer of at\nleast 7 percent of bank assets adjusted by their potential\nrisks.  Unfinished Rules  As the U.S. banking regulators continue working to finish\nthe Basel III rules, two of the five FDIC board members are now\non the record against the fundamental approach adopted by the\n27-nation Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The rules are\nmeant to to strengthen banks enough that they\u2019ll more easily\nweather threats such as those faced during the 2008 global\ncredit crisis.  \u201cWe should learn from past experience and turn our\nattention from using a capital rule that gives what in the end\nis a false sense of security to one that is effective because of\nits simplicity, clarity, and enforceability,\u201d Hoenig said in a\nNovember speech in New York.  Most of the countries signing on to the accord missed the\nJan. 1 implementation date, including the U.S., whose banking\nregulators said in November that U.S. institutions wouldn\u2019t have\nto meet that deadline. The agencies didn\u2019t offer a replacement\ndate, saying in a statement that they are working \u201cas\nexpeditiously as possible.\u201d  Norton, who has worked as a banker at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. \nand in the Treasury Department under  Henry Paulson , said that\nbecause \u201cother countries may not follow\u201d if the U.S. saddles\nits banks with a different regime, the effect of such a change\non the banks\u2019 competitiveness should be \u201cconsidered\ncarefully.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\n Jesse Hamilton  in Washington at \n jhamilton33@bloomberg.net .
