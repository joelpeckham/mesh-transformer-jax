 "context": "The following article called 'Carney Breaks With G-7 by Taking Rates Higher While Talking `Like a Dove'' was published on 2010-07-21. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney \nincreased  interest rates  for a second month yesterday and gave\nhimself room to delay further moves by cutting his growth\nforecast and raising new doubts about the global recovery.  \n Carney, 45, increased the target rate for overnight loans\nbetween commercial banks by a quarter point to 0.75 percent,\nbreaking with his Group of Seven peers who are all keeping their\npolicy rates at or near record lows. He said further action will\nbe \u201cweighed carefully against domestic and global economic\ndevelopments\u201d and cut his growth forecast by 0.2 percentage\npoint this year and next, to 3.5 and 2.9 percent respectively.  \n Carney \u201cwalks like a hawk, talks like a dove,\u201d said\n Stewart Hall , an economist at HSBC Securities in Toronto. \u201cWhat\nit does is keep all options fully open an in an uncertain\ntime.\u201d  \n The bank may raise rates by a half point over its three\nremaining meetings this year as evidence mounts that the\n recovery  is waning, according to a Bloomberg survey. Since\nCanada recorded a 6.1 percent annualized growth rate for the\nfirst quarter, reports have been mixed: Economic growth stalled\nin April while  employment  growth last month meant the country\nhas recovered almost all the jobs lost in the recession that\nended last year.  \n \u201cThe bank has more wiggle room,\u201d said  Sherry Cooper ,\nchief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. \u201cThe\nCanadian economy seems to be slowing now.\u201d  \n \u2018Considerable\u2019 Stimulus  \n Policy makers said yesterday the economy won\u2019t operate at\nfull capacity until the end of next year, six months later than\npredicted in April.  Consumer prices  and the bank\u2019s core measure\nof inflation that excludes eight volatile items will both\nadvance at about a 2 percent annual rate through 2012, the bank\nsaid, adding \u201cconsiderable monetary stimulus\u201d remains in the\neconomy. The bank will release a quarterly economic forecast\npaper tomorrow followed by a press conference.  \n Canada\u2019s housing market, which helped lead the country out\nof recession last year, has cooled.  Housing starts  fell for a\nsecond month in June, and building permits fell 10.8 percent in\nMay.  \n \u201cHousing activity is declining markedly from high levels,\nconsistent with the Bank\u2019s view that policy stimulus resulted in\nhousehold expenditures being brought forward into late 2009 and\nearly 2010,\u201d the bank\u2019s statement said.  \n Slower Global Growth  \n \u201cThe global economic recovery is proceeding but is not yet\nself-sustaining,\u201d the Bank of Canada said yesterday. While\nEuropean governments have taken steps to lower the chance of\n\u201can adverse outcome\u201d from the continent\u2019s debt crisis, their\nresponse will slow global growth, the bank said. The statement\nalso added a new reference to the U.S., Canada\u2019s biggest  trade \npartner, saying that private spending is \u201cpicking up but\nremains uneven.\u201d A combination of slower growth abroad and\nreduced domestic consumer spending will hamper growth, it said.  \n \u201cThey have clearly become more cautious on the global\noutlook,\u201d said  Avery Shenfeld , chief economist at CIBC World\nMarkets in Toronto.  \n The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will\nkeep their key rates at record lows this year, according to\nBloomberg economist surveys, and the Reserve Bank of Australia\nsignaled July 6 it\u2019s prepared to refrain from further increases\nin coming months as signs mount that economies around the world\nwill slow.  \n \u201cGiven the considerable uncertainty surrounding the\noutlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have\nto be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic\ndevelopments,\u201d the bank said, repeating a phrase used in the\nJune 1 rate  increase .  \n \u2018Stay on Hold\u2019  \n \u201cThe same language in June didn\u2019t preclude a rate hike in\nJuly. Investors shouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Bank of Canada\ncarries forward with rate hikes in September and October,\u201d said\nShenfeld. \u201cOdds are that by December they will have seen enough\nof a slowing to stay on hold for a while.\u201d  \n The six-month overnight index  swap  rate, which measures\nwhat investors predict the bank\u2019s policy rate will average over\nthat period, rose 2.5 percent yesterday to 0.9090 percent. The\nCanadian dollar also rose, reversing an earlier decline, after\nthe decision.  \n Canada\u2019s six largest commercial banks, beginning with\n Toronto-Dominion Bank , raised their prime lending rates to 2.75\npercent from 2.5 percent, effective today.  \n Canada\u2019s key rate is now the highest since March 2009, and\nbelow the last peak of 4.5 percent in December 2007. Canada\u2019s\n\u201cmoderate recovery\u201d means rates will keep rising so the\ncentral bank can keep inflation close to its 2 percent target,\nsaid  Craig Wright , chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada, the\ncountry\u2019s biggest bank by assets.  \n \u201cThe question from here is how much and how aggressively\nto move,\u201d Wright said. \u201cUncertainty is with us for a while, so\nfor a central bank you want to have as much flexibility as you\ncan.\u201d  \n To contact the reporter on this story:\n Greg Quinn  in Ottawa at \n gquinn1@bloomberg.net .\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was 37.35969161987305 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Bank Of Montreal was ",
