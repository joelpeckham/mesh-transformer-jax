 "context": "The following article called 'SAP Challenges Oracle by Boosting Flagship Software Speed' was published on 2013-01-11. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSAP AG (SAP)  unveiled the most significant\noverhaul to its mainstay enterprise software in two decades, in\na move to cement its dominance in that market while springing an\nattack on  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) \u2019s database business.  At an event in Palo Alto,  California , the German company\nshowed a much faster version of its Business Suite software\nrunning on top of its Hana database. By speeding up business\ntasks from pricing airline tickets to predicting weather, SAP is\npushing to replace database software from Oracle,  Microsoft\nCorp. (MSFT)  and  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  that customers\nuse to process and analyze information, SAP executives said.  \u201cThis is like the fight for the mobile phone -- the best\ncompanies in the world are competing,\u201d Hasso Plattner, co-\nfounder and supervisory board chairman, said in an interview.\n\u201cI\u2019m comfortable because I see a clear path ahead.\u201d  The move bolsters a core product, which still accounts for\nthe bulk of SAP\u2019s revenue, after a switch in focus in the past\nthree years to expand into mobile and Internet-based software.\nThe company, which has traditionally had to rely on databases\nsupplied by Oracle and IBM, is also betting new features will\nconvince customers to choose its own product.  Investors in the U.S. reacted positively to the news,\nsending SAP shares up 2.9 percent to $82.40 at the close in New\nYork. The shares have advanced 53 percent in the past year.  \u201cSAP is serious about expanding its strategic direction in\nthe database market,\u201d Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura\nHoldings Inc., said in a note to clients yesterday. \u201cWe view\nthe Hana initiatives as a strategic positive in repositioning\nthe company for growth.\u201d Sherlund has a buy rating on the\nshares.  \u2018Comparable Price\u2019  SAP\u2019s Hana software stores data in faster computer memory\ninstead of on slower disk drives, and lets customers handle\nbusiness transaction data and its analysis in the same system,\ninstead of buying two different products.  \u201cWe\u2019re dramatically challenging the database market with a\nnew value proposition and a next-generation technology,\u201d Jim Hagemann Snabe, co-Chief Executive Officer, said in an interview\nin Frankfurt. He called the new Business Suite the biggest\nbreakthrough in applications since SAP released the R/3 software\nin 1992.  SAP is pricing Hana so customers won\u2019t need to pay more in\nlicensing fees that they do for existing databases that handle\nprocessing and analysis needs for their SAP software, executives\nsaid. About 40,000 SAP customers run its applications on Oracle\nor IBM databases.  \u201cIf they use Hana they will get a comparable price even\nthough you could argue it is the best and fastest database in\nthe market,\u201d said Snabe.  \u2018Flagship Product\u2019  SAP, based in Walldorf,  Germany , has about 22 percent of\nthe market for software that lets companies manage tasks such as\npayroll, inventory and product management, according to  Panorama\nConsulting Solutions . Redwood City, California-based Oracle has\na 15 percent share, followed by Microsoft with 10 percent.  \u201cThis is their flagship product, they have to get this\nright,\u201d said Ray Wang, CEO of Constellation Research Inc. \u201cIf\nthe performance difference is creating a huge competitive\nadvantage, I would imagine that a lot of people would consider\u201d\nadopting Hana, he said.  SAP is targeting close to 1,000 customers using some\ncomponents of Business Suite using Hana by the end of the year,\nsaid Bernd Leukert, executive vice president for application\ninnovation.  Plattner said SAP may exert more influence with computer\nmakers over how servers running its products are designed.  \u201cI see that SAP will have a bigger role in designing\nservers,\u201d Plattner said.  Test Customers  Analysts project  that the company\u2019s operating profit grew\n12 percent to 5.27 billion euros last year, according to data\ncompiled by Bloomberg. That would beat the company\u2019s forecast\nrange of 5.05 billion euros to 5.25 billion euros. SAP is\nscheduled to report earnings Jan. 23.  SAP introduced the technology in 2011 and has since worked\nto boost its adoption through subsidies and encouraging startups\nto develop applications to take advantage of its speed. Its goal\nfor last year was to more than double Hana revenue from 160\nmillion euros.  SAP has tested the Hana-driven Business Suite with more\nthan 10 customers including  Deere & Co. (DE) , the largest\nagricultural equipment maker. Deere will be able to use the\nsoftware to offer services to farmers who have Deere equipment,\nincluding weather and crop advice based on weather patterns,\nAiaz Kazi, SAP\u2019s head of technology and innovation platform\nmarketing, said in an interview.  \u2018Real Time\u2019  The technology would let a beverage manufacturer optimize\ndelivery routes by showing a real-time overview of stocks in\nstores across a particular region. A large airline is using it\nto determine ticket prices for individual customers on the fly.  Kurt de Ruwe, the chief information officer of  Bayer AG (BAYN) \u2019s\nMaterialScience unit, which is one of the pilot clients, said\nthe time required for common data analysis tasks were cut to 3\nseconds from 30 seconds, while costs went down 20 percent from\nthe previous setup.  \u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe how fast the data came back,\u201d de\nRuwe said in  Frankfurt . \u201cToday we are constrained by time, but\nwith Hana our outlook could change.\u201d  SAP plans to offer all its programs on the Hana platform\neventually, and to announce as early as May that tools from its\nSuccessFactors and Ariba units will run on Hana, Kazi said.  SAP said it will start providing a rapid-deployment feature\nthis quarter for implementation within six months for customers\nmigrating to Hana. Still, Snabe vowed that Business Suite would\ncontinue supporting rival databases.  He said SAP is trying to train a workforce for quickly\ndelivering the new software and adjusting it to clients\u2019\nsystems, to avoid a \u201cskill gap\u201d that could slow adoption.
