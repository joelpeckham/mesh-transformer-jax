 "context": "The following article called 'JPMorgan Begins Trial to Hold Onto $4 Billion of Disputed WaMu Securities' was published on 2010-12-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nJPMorgan Chase & Co.  began a court\nfight for control of $4 billion in securities it claims to have\nacquired with the purchase  Washington Mutual Inc. \u2019s bank for\n$1.9 billion in 2008.  JPMorgan wants U.S. Bankruptcy Judge  Mary F. Walrath  in\nWilmington, Delaware, to rule that investors got preferred stock\nin WaMu in exchange for the debt-like, trust-preferred\nsecurities when WaMu\u2019s bank was seized by regulators. The Office\nof Thrift Supervision ordered the exchange to ensure that WaMu\u2019s\nbank kept control of the securities, according to court records.  Walrath said she will rule on whether that exchange\nactually took place when she decides to approve or reject\nSeattle-based WaMu\u2019s bankruptcy liquidation plan. Walrath will\nstart a hearing on the plan tomorrow.  The judge today questioned one of the arguments of hedge\nfunds claiming to own $1.1 billion of the securities. The funds\nsaid they still own the debt-like investments because WaMu\ndidn\u2019t create, register and deliver the stock they were supposed\nto get in exchange for the trust-preferred securities.  \u201cThat makes no sense,\u201d Walrath told attorney  Robert J.\nStark , who is representing hedge fund managers including Black\nHorse Capital LP and Lonestar Partners LP.  JPMorgan argued that the exchange took place even though\ninvestors still have physical possession of the paper securities\nand never received stock certificates.  \u2018Automatic\u2019 Exchange  \u201cThe exchange was automatic as of the day the OTS said it\nshould happen,\u201d JPMorgan attorney  Stacey Friedman  told Walrath,\nreferring to the Office of Thrift Supervision.  New York-based JPMorgan is the second biggest U.S. bank by\nassets behind Bank of America.  Investors bought the securities from a WaMu affiliate\nknowing that under certain circumstances the investments would\nbe exchanged for WaMu stock, Friedman said in court.  The hedge funds sued JPMorgan trying to win control of the\nsecurities, which entitle the owner to payments backed by\n$13 billion of mortgages.  The securities are part of a settlement between WaMu and\nJPMorgan that is at the heart of the $7 billion repayment plan\nthat Walrath will consider approving later this week.  WaMu agreed to drop claims against JPMorgan and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corp. over the seizure of its bank in return\nfor part of about $10 billion in cash and tax refunds.  WaMu filed for  bankruptcy  on Sept. 26, 2008, the day after\nits banking unit was taken over by regulators and sold to\nJPMorgan. Before it failed, Washington Mutual Bank had more than\n2,200 branches and $188 billion in deposits.  Each Side\u2019s Aim  The hedge funds asked Walrath to rule that the trust-\npreferred securities were never exchanged for stock. JPMorgan is\nasking her to rule that the exchange did take place. Whoever\nwins that dispute would be considered the owner of the\nsecurities, which entitle the owner to regular payments from the\n$13 billion of mortgages.  The bankruptcy case is In Re Washington Mutual Inc., 08-\n12229, and the securities lawsuit is Black Horse Capital LP v.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-51387, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,\nDistrict of Delaware (Wilmington).
