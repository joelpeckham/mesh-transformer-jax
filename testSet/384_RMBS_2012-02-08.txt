 "context": "The following article called 'Rambus Rises After Reaching Patent Settlement With Nvidia' was published on 2012-02-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRambus Inc. (RMBS) , a memory-chip designer\nthat gets most of its revenue from royalties, rose the most in 1\n1/2 months after reaching a patent agreement with  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) ,\nending a legal battle over graphics technology.  Financial details weren\u2019t disclosed. The accord covers a\nbroad range of semiconductor products offered by Nvidia,\nSunnyvale, California-based Rambus said in a statement today.  \u201cThis settlement was a surprise,\u201d said Hamed Khorsand, an\nanalyst at BWS Financial Inc. who recommends buying Rambus\nshares. \u201cIt also validates patents Rambus has been starting.\u201d  The agreement clears away any threat of a ban on U.S.\nimports of products with graphics chips made by  Santa Clara ,\nCalifornia-based Nvidia, and provides a new source of revenue to\nmoney-losing Rambus, which reported $312.4 million in revenue\nlast year.  Rambus had filed two patent-infringement complaints against\nNvidia at the U.S. International Trade Commission, which has the\npower to block imports of products that violate U.S. patents. In\nthe first case, the Washington-based agency sided with Rambus,\nand a U.S. appeals court heard arguments in October. A trade\njudge was scheduled to issue his findings in the second case on\nMarch 2.  Rambus, which has been embroiled in litigation for more\nthan a decade against companies that refused to license its\npatents, reached a five-year agreement with  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  in\nDecember. Broadcom also had been named in the ITC case.  Starting to Settle  \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that one by one, the companies involved\nin the ITC matter are starting to settle,\u201d Khorsand said.\n\u201cCompanies might be looking at it from a standpoint where the\npatents will be upheld and Rambus would be able to force them to\nstop selling into the U.S.\u201d  Rambus  climbed  9.1 percent to $8.24 at the close in New\nYork, the biggest increase since Dec. 23, when it announced the\nBroadcom agreement. The shares are still about 54 percent below\nthe closing price on Nov. 15, the day before Rambus lost a  jury\ntrial  in which it alleged that  Micron Technology Inc. (MU)  and  Hynix\nSemiconductor Inc. (000660)  conspired to prevent its memory chips from\nbecoming an industry standard. Nvidia  rose  3.6 percent to\n$16.31.
