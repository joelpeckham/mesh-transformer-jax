 "context": "The following article called 'Stock Buybacks Surge as Companies Borrow for Share Repurchases' was published on 2010-09-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRecord-low interest rates are\nstoking the biggest increase in U.S. share buybacks ever.  \n American companies announced $55.9 billion in repurchases\nsince June, data compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc. show. That\nadds to $93.5 billion in the second quarter and $108.3 billion\nduring the first three months of the year, compared with $125\nbillion in all of 2009. Corporations are using debt to pay for\nbuybacks after the average yield on U.S. investment grade bonds\nfell to an all-time low of  3.70 percent  last month, data from\nLondon-based Barclays Plc show.  \n Companies from  Microsoft Corp.  to PepsiCo Inc. and Hewlett-\nPackard Co. are taking advantage of low-cost financing,\npurchasing their stock to boost per-share earnings at a time\nwhen the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index trades at a 24 percent\ndiscount to its average  valuation  since 1954. At the same time,\nchoosing buybacks may show executives are too concerned about\nthe economy to invest in new projects or make acquisitions.  \n \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap to do it now in the bond market: issue\ndebt, fix their cost of capital, then shrink the number of\nshares outstanding,\u201d said  James Swanson , chief investment\nstrategist at Boston-based MFS Investment Management, which\noversees about $197 billion. \u201cThe markets are almost calling\nfor them to do it.\u201d  \n Fivefold Rise  \n U.S. companies have announced $258 billion in buybacks so\nfar this year, compared with $52 billion in the first three\nquarters of 2009, according to data compiled by Birinyi. The\nalmost fivefold increase is the largest for any January-to-\nSeptember period since at least 2000, when the Westport,\nConnecticut-based research firm started tracking the data.  \n Buybacks let firms boost per-share  profits  by reducing\ntheir equity base and may indicate executives find their stock\nundervalued. Evidence that businesses are parting with their\nrecord  cash  shows concern the economy will slip into its second\nrecession in three years is diminishing.  \n \u201cLevering a balance sheet is a good idea if you want to\nexpand your company,\u201d said  Hayes Miller , the Boston-based head\nof asset allocation in North America at Baring Asset Management,\nwhich manages about $44 billion. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that unless you\nfeel secure about 2011. It may just be the corporate outlook for\n2011 is better than you would gather from economic news.\u201d  \n Microsoft will sell debt to pay for  dividends  and stock\nbuybacks, a person familiar with the matter said last week. The\nRedmond, Washington-based software maker could issue as much as\n$6 billion in debt without putting its  credit rating  at risk,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \n Takeovers  \n Peter Wootton, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to comment.  \n PepsiCo  in Purchase, New York, has sold $4.25 billion of\nbonds in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The\ncompany said in January that it aimed to use debt proceeds to\nfinance the takeover of two bottlers and for other corporate\npurposes that may include buybacks.  \n The company authorized a plan on March 15 to repurchase as\nmuch as $15 billion in stock over three years. With the\nacquisition now complete,  PepsiCo  is able to increase buybacks\nthat were postponed during the negotiations, according to\nspokesman  Dave DeCecco .  \n The maker of Doritos and Mountain Dew predicted on July 20\nthat  earnings  per share will grow 11 percent to 13 percent.\nZurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG estimated 3 to 4 percentage\npoints of that will be from share repurchases. Buybacks may\ntotal $4.4 billion in 2010, Pepsi said on July 20. That\u2019s 4.3\npercent of its average  market value  this year.  \n Boosting Debt  \n HP boosted short- and long-term borrowing by $4.18 billion\nbetween January and July, Bloomberg data show. The week before\nthe Palo Alto, California-based company sold $3 billion in bonds\non Sept. 8, it added $10 billion to its plan for share\nrepurchases, an increase to the $4.9 billion already authorized.\nBuybacks are among potential uses for the debt proceeds,\naccording to a Sept. 9  filing . Anything listed in a government\nfiling is a possibility, said  Gina Tyler , a HP spokeswoman.  \n \u201cOftentimes, you\u2019ll see a debt issuance almost\nsimultaneously with a share buyback announcement,\u201d said  Guy Lebas , chief fixed-income strategist and economist at Janney\nMontgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. \u201cEven though there\u2019s no\nexplicit connection, it only takes a little bit of common sense\nto realize the relationship.\u201d  \n Completing the plan would reduce HP\u2019s  stock  outstanding by\n14 percent, based on the average price in 2010. The largest\npersonal-computer maker said Aug. 19 that it bought back 55\nmillion shares in the fiscal third quarter, prompting analysts\nat Susquehanna Financial Group LLP to raise the  profit  estimate\nfor the following period by 1 cent to $1.27 a share.  \n Weakening Growth  \n U.S. companies are boosting share buybacks as economic\ngrowth weakens from 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009, the\nbiggest increase since 2006. Gross domestic product may rise at\nan annual pace of 1.9 percent in the three months ended Sept.\n30, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 63\neconomists.  \n \u201cIf that\u2019s the best use of companies\u2019 cash, then that\nreally doesn\u2019t tell a great story about how corporations are\nfeeling for the near future,\u201d said  John Canally , an investment\nstrategist and economist at LPL Financial Corp., which oversees\n$276.9 billion in Boston. \u201cThings aren\u2019t terrible, but they\naren\u2019t great either.\u201d  \n Below Record  \n Announced buybacks this year are about 70 percent below the\nrecord $863 billion pledged in 2007, Birinyi data show. While\nthe S&P 500 trades at  12.4  times forecast earnings for the next\n12 months, compared with a 56-year average of 16.4 times\nreported profit, low valuations haven\u2019t been enough to spur an\nequity rally.  \n The S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent to 1,142.71 today, the highest\nlevel since May 13. It\u2019s up 2.5 percent in 2010 and down 6.1\npercent from its April high. The index gained 1.5 percent last\n week  amid speculation Microsoft will sell debt for share\nbuybacks and after Oracle Corp. beat earnings estimates.  \n Decreasing price-earnings ratios and record low interest\nrates are spurring executives to raise money in credit markets.\nU.S. companies have sold $83.4 billion in new stock in 2010, the\nlowest level for the first nine months of any year since 2005,\nbased on data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, companies\nsold $786 billion in both high-yield and investment-grade U.S.-\ndollar denominated debt after $1.23 trillion last year.  \n Fed\u2019s Rate  \n The Federal Reserve has held its target rate for overnight\nloans between banks at zero to 0.25 percent since cutting it in\nDecember 2008. The lowest benchmark borrowing costs in the U.S.\nand the Fed\u2019s purchase of bonds pushed the average yield on U.S.\ninvestment grade debt to 3.70 percent last month, Barclays says.  \n As yields sank, the relative return for holding dividend-\npaying stocks grew. Last month, more companies in the S&P 500\npaid dividends that exceeded the average interest rate on\ncorporate bonds than any time in at least 15 years, Bloomberg\ndata show.  \n The  level  of debt outstanding among American companies\noutside the financial industry increased 1 percent between April\nand the end of June to an all-time high of $7.26 trillion, a\nsecond quarterly advance, according to Federal Reserve data\nreleased on Sept. 17.  \n While industrial and consumer companies are paying down\nloans, computer makers, energy producers and utilities in the\nS&P 500 are boosting borrowings to record levels, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. Technology makers in the S&P 500 owe\n$123 billion, and oil and  power  companies had long- and short-\nterm debt of $204 billion and $324 billion at the end of the\nsecond quarter.  \n Free Cash Flow  \n Per-share free cash flow in the S&P 500, or earnings minus\ncapital expenses, rose to $102.01 this quarter, the highest\nlevel since at least 2000, according to Bloomberg data.\nExcluding banks, brokerages and insurance companies, S&P 500\ncompanies generated $682.2 billion in cash and near-cash items\nlast quarter, the data show.  \n \u201cCorporations are finally feeling a little bit more\ncomfortable and realizing that their own shares are cheap and\nfinancing is very cheap, so why not issue some debt and buy back\nstock?\u201d said  David Kelly , who helps oversee about $445 billion\nas chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a great way of distributing cash to shareholders and\nboosting stock prices.\u201d  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\n Lynn Thomasson  in Hong Kong at \n lthomasson@bloomberg.net ;\n Alexis Xydias  in London at \n axydias@bloomberg.net .  \n To contact the editors responsible for this story:\nDarren Boey at   dboey@bloomberg.net ;\nDavid Merritt at   dmerritt1@bloomberg.net .  \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                                                 \n                     \n                     Enlarge image \n                     \n                     \n                       MFS Investment Management's James Swanson  \n                       \n                         \n                           Michael Fein/Bloomberg \n                         \n                         \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap to do it now in the bond market: issue debt, fix their cost of capital, then shrink the number of shares outstanding,\u201d said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at Boston-based MFS Investment Management. \n                       \n                     \n                                        \n           \n                     \u201cIt\u2019s so cheap to do it now in the bond market: issue debt, fix their cost of capital, then shrink the number of shares outstanding,\u201d said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at Boston-based MFS Investment Management.
