 "context": "The following article called 'Apple-Samsung Patent Judge Seeks Report on Horse Trading' was published on 2012-08-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung Electronics\nCo. were urged by a judge to narrow the claims in their dispute\nover smartphone patents and to report to the court on talks\nbetween the companies\u2019 chief executives.  U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh said today in federal court in\n San Jose ,  California , that she remains \u201cpathologically\noptimistic\u201d the companies can settle. Separately, in the event\nthe jury is left to decide the case, she said she wants a\nstatement from the companies by Aug. 18 reporting whether\n\u201cthere has been some successful horse trading\u201d to streamline\nand simplify claims.  Apple sued Samsung in April 2011, accusing it of copying\npatented designs for mobile devices, and Samsung countersued.\nThe case is the first to go before a federal jury in a battle\nbeing waged on four continents for dominance in a smartphone\nmarket valued by Bloomberg Industries at $219.1 billion.  The trial, now in its third week, continued today with\ntestimony from Michael Wagner, an accountant called by  Samsung (005930) \nto rebut Apple\u2019s claims that it\u2019s owed at least $2.5 billion in\ndamages. Wagner said Cupertino, California-based Apple failed to\ninclude all of Samsung\u2019s costs in its calculations.  Sales Ban  In addition to damages, Apple is seeking to make permanent\na preliminary ban it won on U.S. sales of a Samsung tablet, and\nextend the ban to Samsung smartphones. Samsung, based in Suwon,\n South Korea , is trying to persuade the jury to declare Apple\u2019s\n patents  invalid and to find that Apple has infringed its own\npatents.  Koh said yesterday that both sides face risks in a jury\nverdict and urged the CEOs to talk before jurors begin\ndeliberating. Koh said she wants deliberations to begin by Aug.\n21. Lawyers for the companies said they would comply with her\nrequest.  The judge earlier this year ordered Apple CEO  Tim Cook  to\nmeet face to face with his counterpart at Samsung, Choi Gee Sung, who has since been replaced as CEO by Kwon Oh Hyun. The\nMay conference didn\u2019t yield a settlement.  \u201cIt\u2019s at least worth one more try,\u201d Koh said yesterday.  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-\ncv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California\n(San Jose).
