 "context": "The following article called 'Former HSBC Economist Barker to Start Asia Macro Fund in March' was published on 2013-11-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGeoff Barker, a former HSBC Holdings\nPlc economist, plans to start a new Asian macro hedge fund in\nMarch after lead managing an earlier pool to a 10.4 percent\nannualized gain since 2006.  Counterpoint Asian Macro Fund will be managed by a venture\nhe set up with  City Financial Investment Co. , making him the\nfirst Asia-based manager backed by the London-headquartered\ncompany, which is led by two former executives of Invesco Ltd.\u2019s\nPerpetual asset management unit, he said.  Barker is the latest hedge-fund manager in the region to\njoin what are known as \u201cplatforms\u201d that provide non-investment\nservices to help them cut startup costs and attract\ninstitutional investors. Hedge-fund startups are turning to the\nplatforms, such as the one offered by City Financial, after\nfunds-of-funds that rely on wealthy individuals lost assets\nfollowing the global financial crisis in 2008, hampering smaller\n hedge funds \u2019 ability to raise capital.  \u201cIt\u2019s better to be part of a business that we know is\ncapable of passing due diligence of major investors,\u201d Barker\nsaid in an interview on Nov. 14 in Hong Kong. \u201cIn the post-Global-Financial-Crisis world, scale is more important.\u201d  Managers already overseeing $5 billion or more attracted\n$127.5 billion of new capital since 2009, while smaller funds\nexperienced net outflows, according to Chicago-based data\nprovider Hedge Fund Research Inc.  City Financial  The tie-up with City Financial will allow Barker to avoid\nhaving to hire a larger team and rent greater  office space  in an\nuncertain fundraising environment, he said. City Financial,\nwhich has backed other hedge funds such as energy futures and\nweather derivatives trader Cumulus Asset Management LLP, also\nadds credibility to a new business, he added.  \u201cThe most important thing is you should have a business as\nwell as a fund,\u201d Barker said. \u201cWe can do it ourselves but it\u2019s\nprobably easier, quicker, less risky, more credible if we do it\nwith a partner that\u2019s already got that.\u201d  City Financial will provide services such as accounting,\n information technology , legal and compliance in exchange for a\nshare of Counterpoint\u2019s fee revenue, Barker said. It can also\nhelp managers it backs raise money, he said.  City Financial-backed managers oversee a combined $1.3\nbillion of assets. It was acquired in 2006 by a partnership\nformed by Rob Hain, a former chief executive officer of Invesco\nPerpetual, and  Andrew Williams , according to its  website .  Among its backers is David Beatty, chairman of Temasek\nHoldings Pte-invested Inmet Mining Corp., owner of the second-largest copper project under construction.  Track Record  Barker was the manager of the BIA Pacific Macro Fund, whose\nassets peaked at about $400 million in 2009 after starting in\nMarch 2006, for Hong Kong-based Ballingal Investment Advisors\nLtd. The fund was co-managed by the company\u2019s chief investment\nofficer, Andrew Ballingal.  The BIA fund returned 43 percent in 2008, betting against\nequities and commodities while buying bonds, Barker said. Asian\nhedge-fund peers lost an average of 20 percent that year, their\nworst annual loss, according to an  index  of Singapore-based data\nprovider Eurekahedge Pte.  The BIA fund gained 20 percent in 2011 and lost 17 percent\nin 2009, its worst year, he added. It returned 22 percent this\nyear before Barker\u2019s departure, making money from  China \u2019s\nliquidity squeeze in June, he said.  The Counterpoint fund, which Barker named to indicate his\ncontrarian approach and ability to outperform in market\ndownturns, will trade equity index futures, currencies,\n government bonds  and commodities, Barker said.  Rates, Currencies  Barker is starting his new fund as the low-interest rate,\nlow-inflation environment, driven partly by goods made by cheap\nlabor in China and  India , is coming to an end.  \u201cThe opportunities are going to be in  interest rates  and\ncurrencies,\u201d Barker said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time and\ndegree how much interest rates are going to go up. It also re-introduces some two-way flows into the  currency markets  because\nsome countries will do it more quickly than others.\u201d  Rising interest rates could further create swings in other\nrisky assets such as stocks and properties, he added.  Barker moved to  Japan  almost 24 years ago as the Japan\neconomist and head of research for Baring Securities in  Tokyo ,\naccording to an official biography. He went on to become HSBC\u2019s\nHong Kong-based chief economist and head of research in  Asia \nbefore the Ballingal stint, it said.
