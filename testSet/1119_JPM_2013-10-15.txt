 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Bill Supply at Eisenhower-Era Low Seen Bolstering Bonds' was published on 2013-10-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLost amid concern that the U.S. is\nheaded toward a default is a fact that bulls say may help\nunderpin American debt prices: supply of the shortest-term\nsecurities is shrinking.  Treasury bills  make up 13.2  percent  of the $11.6 trillion\nin  marketable debt  outstanding, the smallest share since Dwight\nEisenhower was president in the 1950s and down from 34.4 percent\nin 2008, according to Barclays Plc. The drop reflects efforts by\nthe government to take advantage of record-low interest rates by\nselling more longer-term debt after the financial crisis,\npushing the average maturity of the Treasury\u2019s debt to 5.4 years\nfrom 4.1 years in early 2009.  The reduced supply of high-quality, short-term debt\ncombined with rising speculation that the government shutdown\nwill curb economic growth and lead the  Federal Reserve  to keep\nup unprecedented stimulus may only enhance the appeal of the\nsecurities once the specter of default passes. Rates on one-month bills jumped to 0.34 percent last week, from as low as\n0.01 percent at the start of the month.  The selloff \u201cbegets opportunistic buying on the part of\nPimco,\u201d  Bill Gross , the co-chief investment officer at  Newport\nBeach , California-based Pacific Investment Management Co., said\nin an Oct. 9 Bloomberg Television interview. \u201cWe\u2019re picking up\npennies on the street. This is a particular penny that we think\nis risk-free,\u201d said Gross, whose company manages $1.97\ntrillion, including the world\u2019s biggest bond fund.  Safe Capital  Bills, which have maturities of one year or less and are\nconsidered a cash equivalent by investors, are increasingly\nneeded by banks and money funds as new regulations related to\nthe U.S. Dodd-Frank Act and rules from the Basel, Switzerland-based  Bank for International Settlements  require banks to hold\nmore capital that is considered safe.  Even with the U.S. in jeopardy of defaulting and facing a\npossible downgrade, that demand wouldn\u2019t likely weaken,\naccording to fixed-income strategists at New York-based JPMorgan\nChase & Co., the largest  U.S. bank  by assets.  \u201cMost holders of Treasuries are not ratings-driven, and\nthis is certainly the case for the largest holders such as\ncentral banks and commercial banks,\u201d JPMorgan strategists led\nby  Alex Roever  in  New York , said in an Oct. 10 report to\nclients.  Debt Talks  U.S. Senate Democratic and Republican leaders said late\nyesterday in  Washington  they were optimistic about ending a\npartial government shutdown and preventing the nation from\nbreaching the debt ceiling on Oct. 17. The debt limit, now $16.7\ntrillion, has been raised 78  times  since 1960, according to the\nTreasury department.  A deal under discussion would suspend the debt limit\nthrough Feb. 15, 2014, fund the government through Jan. 15,\n2014, and require a House-Senate conference on budget matters by\nDec. 15, according to a Senate source familiar with the talks,\nwho spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss them.  \u201cWe are not really taking in consideration of default,\u201d\n Deborah Cunningham , the head of money-market funds at\nPittsburgh-based Federated Investors Inc., the third-biggest\nU.S. money fund manager, said in a telephone interview Oct. 10.\n\u201cWe would love to not always have to be pushed in the\ndiscussion to the 11th hour. I\u2019m not surprised by it, but in the\nend I\u2019m not real worried about it either.\u201d  Rising Rates  Bond markets in the U.S. were closed yesterday for the\nColumbus Day holiday. One-month  Treasury bill rates  surged to\n0.3397 percent on Oct. 8, the highest since October 2008, before\nending the week at 0.2484 percent amid speculation a compromise\nwould be found to allow at least a temporary lifting of the debt\nceiling. The rate was at 0.2434 as of 7:01 a.m. in New York.  Treasury 10-year note yields climbed three basis points\ntoday to 2.72 percent.  The 10-year yield, used to help set  interest rates  for\neverything from  car loans  to mortgages, remains below its 2013\nclosing high of 2.99 percent reached Sept. 5, before the Fed\nannounced on Sept. 18 it would maintain its $85 billion a month\nof bond buying to stimulate the economy.  Treasury officials ramped up sales of bills after the\ncollapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 to inject cash\ninto the financial system amid rising demand for the safest of\nassets. Bills, which made up 21.3 percent of government debt at\nthe end of fiscal 2006, jumped to 34.4 percent in 2008.  Funding Switch  As the crisis eased, the Treasury switched to selling more\nlonger-term debt to lock in record-low rates. The average\n maturity  of  U.S. debt  was 64.5 months in March, up from a 24-year low of 49.4 months in 2009.  The percentage of bills outstanding will fall to 12.4\npercent in 2014 and 8.1 percent in 2023, according to\nprojections from the Treasury Department  presented  before its\nmost recent quarterly debt auction.  In the 1950s, yields on 10-year notes fell as low as 2.29\npercent, monthly data collected by the Fed show, as unemployment\nreached a nine-year high of 7.5 percent during the Eisenhower\nadministration and the U.S. paid for postwar reconstruction and\nthe beginnings of the space program.  The 1950s were \u201ca period of normalization of interest\nrates, after the Treasury and the Fed basically had pegged rates\nup until 1951, suppressing them for 13 to 14 years to reduce the\ncost of Treasury financing during the Great Depression,\u201d  Jack Malvey , the chief global-markets strategist at Bank of New York\nMellon Corp., said in a telephone interview on Oct. 11. The firm\nmanages $1.3 trillion.  Maturing Bills  About $417 billion in short-term debt comes due between\nOct. 17 and Nov. 7. That includes $120 billion of bills maturing\non Oct. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. An\nadditional $93 billion of bills are due on Oct. 24. On the last\nday of the month, $150 billion needs to be paid back, including\ntwo-year and five-year notes that have matured.  BlackRock Inc., the world\u2019s largest asset manager, followed\n Fidelity Investments  and JPMorgan Chase on Oct. 11 in declaring\nits money funds free of the bills that would be most affected by\na default. Investors pulled $28.7 billion from U.S. money funds\nin the seven days ended Friday, according to the research firm\nCrane Data LLC in Westborough,  Massachusetts .  Fahad Almubarak, the chief of  Saudi Arabia \u2019s central bank,\ntold reporters at a news conference on Oct. 11 after a speech in\nWashington that \u201cthe U.S. current crisis will go away, and we\nthink its effect won\u2019t be lasting on our investments.\u201d  U.S. \u2018Upheaval\u2019  \u201cThe dollar is the reserve currency of the world and\nTreasuries are the reserve asset of the world, despite the fact\nthat it is the U.S. going through this political and monetary\nupheaval,\u201d Simon Ballard, a senior credit strategist at\nNational Australia Bank Ltd. in  London , said in a telephone\ninterview on Oct. 2.  International Monetary Fund economists said a U.S. default\nmight \u201cseriously\u201d harm global activity, and cut forecasts for\nthis year and next to 2.9 percent and 3.6 percent, from the 3.1\npercent and 3.8 percent estimated in July.  That may push more money into bills and bonds. JPMorgan\u2019s\nweekly  Treasury investor  sentiment index rose to 10 on Oct. 7,\nfrom negative 9 in the month-earlier survey and as low this year\nas negative 23 on May 27. The gauge, which reached a high of 34\nin October 2010, subtracts the percentage of investors expecting\nprices to fall from those expecting a rise.  \u201cIf we slide past the 17th without an agreement to\nincrease the debt limit, it will be bad for the economy for\nsure, but it won\u2019t mean a default,\u201d  Jim Bianco , president of\nBianco Research LLC in  Chicago , said by telephone on Oct. 13.\n\u201cThat would set up the most bullish scenario you can imagine\nfor Treasuries, which would be that the economy is collapsing\nand the Fed is likely throwing even more money at it.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nLiz Capo McCormick in New York at \n Emccormick7@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nDave Liedtka at \n dliedtka@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 42.11259078979492 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
