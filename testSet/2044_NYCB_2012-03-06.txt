 "context": "The following article called 'Scene Last Night: David Koch, Navab, DiMenna, Walter Isaacson' was published on 2012-03-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nHe bows, he sways, he\u2019s No. 9 on the\nBloomberg Billionaires Index, and last night he danced with\nstudents of the School of American Ballet.  David Koch , 71, showed off his moves at the school\u2019s annual\nbenefit, which transformed the promenade of the David H. Koch\nTheater (named following his $100 million donation) into a\nRussian Winter Ball.  Beef Stroganoff, sweet and tangy shredded beets and shots\nof vodka were on the menu by Glorious Food. The music was all-\nAmerican: on DJ Coleman Feltes\u2019s playlist were  Michael Jackson \u2019s\n\u201cBeat It,\u201d Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believing\u201d and Deee-Lite\u2019s\n\u201cGroove Is in the Heart,\u201d in that order.  Koch\u2019s wife, Julia, had the idea for the theme, a nod to\nthe school\u2019s founder,  George Balanchine . She wore a dress with\nfur trim; her husband wore a coordinating tuxedo featuring a\nmaroon velvet jacket.  Alexander Navab of  KKR & Co. (KKR) ,  Chelsea Clinton , a new NBC\nNews correspondent, Joseph DiMenna of Zweig-DiMenna Associates\nand about 400 others supped at long tables covered in red\nbrocade, decorated with tall crystal candelabras and bouquets of\nred and pink roses, all selected by Ron Wendt Design.  The event raised almost $1 million for the school, where 70\npercent of the advanced students receive scholarships, said\nexecutive director Marjorie Van Dercook.  Russian Hooligans  The nightclub-style dancing came after 28 advanced students\nperformed a high-energy number depicting Russian hooligans, set\nto original music by Debauche, a \u201cRussian Mafia Band,\u201d as it\nbills itself.  The school\u2019s artistic director, New York City Ballet Master\nin Chief Peter Martins, recruited former NYCB principal and Tony\nnominee Melinda Roy to choreograph the performance with\nassistance from Chad Luke Schiro.  The show got Koch right out of his gold seat.  \u201cYou were great,\u201d he exclaimed to student Claire von Enck\nas the music swelled.  Things were quieter earlier in the evening at the  New York \nPublic Library\u2019s President\u2019s Council Spring Dinner, where Third\nPoint founder  Daniel Loeb  asked Walter Isaacson if he was\nworking on an update of his biography of  Steve Jobs .  Isaacson told Loeb he\u2019d consider an update, but is already\nabsorbed by a new book project about digital innovators,\nstarting with Ada Byron Lovelace, poet  Lord Byron \u2019s daughter.  An Algorithm  Lovelace wrote an algorithm that could be applied to make\npatterns on fabrics, Isaacson, the event\u2019s featured speaker,\nsaid. He learned about Lovelace when his daughter Betsy, now a\nsenior at Harvard, wrote a high-school paper on her.  He said he\u2019s pitching the book today to his editor Alice\nMayhew at  Simon & Schuster (CBS) , and in two weeks, is going to\nBodleian, Oxford University\u2019s main research library, to read\nLovelace\u2019s letters.  Another guest asked Isaacson what he thought of Apple\u2019s\nfuture.  Noting the imminent release of the iPad 3, Isaacson said he\nthought the team Jobs had put in place would run Apple well for\nthe next four or five years.
