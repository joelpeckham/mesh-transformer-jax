 "context": "The following article called 'Varco to Honghua Vying for $9 Billion of Russia Oil Rigs: Energy' was published on 2013-05-29. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRussia \u2019s thirst for modern rigs able\nto drill in shale  oil deposits  heralds a $9 billion bonanza for\nmanufacturers including  National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NOV)  of the U.S.\nand  China \u2019s Honghua Group.  More than 57 percent of the nation\u2019s 1,835-strong rig fleet\nis over 20 years old, according to VTB Capital research. Built\nto Soviet designs, many won\u2019t be powerful or advanced enough for\nproducers such as  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  and  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  Neft when they\nbegin exploring Siberia\u2019s shale rock, said Antony Crawford,\nRussia head for National Oilwell. The largest U.S. oil equipment\nsupplier competes with Honghua and OAO OMZ for orders in Russia,\nthe world\u2019s largest energy producer.  \u201cRussia\u2019s rig fleet is too old, too light and it lacks\nagility,\u201d said Olga Danilenko, an oilfield services analyst at\nRussian investment bank VTB Capital. Paying to move an old rig\nin a remote region is a big risk considering the likelihood of a\nbreakdown and expensive logistics in providing parts, she said.  Rosneft and partner  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  started exploring the\nBazhenov shale this year, a Siberian formation as big as  France \nthat state geologists estimate contains enough oil to more than\ndouble Russia\u2019s reserves. President  Vladimir Putin  wants it\ndeveloped to help maintain production above 10 million barrels a\nday. Compared with conventional oil, shale needs more rigs. The\nmachines also must be more powerful, driving unit costs to the\nmiddle of a $10 million-$60 million  price range .  \u201cNew drilling rigs must be built,\u201d said Crawford, whose\nHouston-based company plans a factory east of Moscow. \u201cThis\nissue represents a clear and present danger to Russia\u2019s ability\nto maintain output during the next three to five years.\u201d  New Rigs  Deliveries of new rigs will reach a five-year high of 105\nunits this year, according to VTB data. Still, older rigs are\nbeing retired at a rate of more than 400 a year, threatening a\nsqueeze on capacity as drilling ramps up.  National Oilwell, which had $20 billion in revenue last\nyear, may sell five rigs to Russia-focused companies this year,\nVTB said. It will compete with Russia\u2019s OAO OMZ, owner of the\nUralmash plant, a Soviet tank factory in World War II that\nbecame one of the world\u2019s biggest rig builders during the oil\nboom of the 1970s. While production collapsed after the end of\ncommunism, it remains an important supplier.  Honghua Group (196) , China\u2019s largest exporter of drilling rigs,\nsees a need for more of its gear in Russia, Zhang Mi, chairman\nand president, said earlier this month in an interview. The\ncompany\u2019s second-largest sales region is Russia, he said.  Innovative Equipment  \u201cHalf the drilling rigs there are outdated,\u201d Mi said\nthrough a translator at the Offshore Technology Conference in\nHouston. \u201cThey see a great need for new innovative equipment.\u201d  The company has started a joint venture in Russia to meet\ndemand, he said.  \u201cPart of the production equipment is coming from China and\npart from Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether we are able to meet the\ndemand in Russia.\u201d  Honghua shares dropped 1.3 percent to close at HK$3.79 in\nHong Kong trading today. National Oilwell Varco traded little\nchanged at $71.50 in New York at 10:04 a.m. local time.  Last year Russia\u2019s monthly count of rigs in operation\nranged from a low of 717 rigs in February to a high of 978 rigs\nin June, according to data on REnergyCo\u2019s website.  A lack of rig capacity hasn\u2019t yet dented Russian output,\nwhich hovered near a post-Soviet record at 10.47 million barrels\na day in March, and it may be early to talk about a drilling rig\nshortage, said Ildar Davletshin, an oil and gas analyst at\n Renaissance Capital .  Tighter Balance  \u201cThe talk about shortage has been ongoing for many years,\nbut so far it has not materialized,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is\ntighter balance for high-spec rigs that will be potentially in\nhigher demand\u201d as shale fields are developed.  Chinese, U.S. and German manufacturers seem capable of\ndelivering required quantities of rigs, he said.  Rosneft and Gazprom Neft have paired with  Royal Dutch Shell\nPlc (RDSA) , seeking to follow strategies used in the U.S., where\nblasting oil from rock in places like the Bakken shale in  North\nDakota  reversed decades of production declines.  Because oil can be harder to extract from shale, rigs often\nneed to turn a drill bit 90 degrees and continue penetrating\nhorizontally. This is combined with a process called fracturing\nwhere water, sand and chemicals are pumped into a well to smash\nrock and increase oil flows.  Stumbling Block  A lack of modern rigs remains a key stumbling block to\ndeveloping Bazhenov, Bernstein analysts including  Oswald Clint \nwrote in a note yesterday. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, at\nhorizontal wells in Russia breaks even at $90 a barrel without\ntax breaks, they estimated. Russia\u2019s Urals export blend is\ntrading at about $102 a barrel.  Rosneft and Gazprom Neft didn\u2019t respond to requests for\ncomment on Russia\u2019s oil rig fleet.  In the U.S., 250 rigs are need to produce about 700,000\nbarrels a day at the Bakken shale, said  Richard Anderson , chief\nfinancial officer of  Eurasia Drilling (EDCL)  Co., Russia\u2019s largest rig\noperator. That gives an indication of how many rigs could be\nneeded to to exploit the Bazhenov, he said.  Supplying that number of rigs at an average of $35 million\nwould cost $8.8 billion.  \u201cThese rigs are not currently in the Russian drilling\nfleet, so they would need to be added,\u201d Anderson said.  Rosneft,  OAO Lukoil (LKOH)  and Gazprom Neft are already snapping\nup services for horizontal drilling and fracturing for more\nprofitable wells before producing a single commercial barrel\nfrom the Bazhenov. Rosneft will drill and fracture 50 horizontal\nthis year compared to three last year. TNK-BP, newly purchased\nby Rosneft, will use the technique in almost half the wells it\ndrills this year, a sixfold increase in just two years. Gazprom\nNeft will double wells using this technique.  Drilling Power  Another concern is whether Russia has enough drilling\npower, according to Leonid Mirzoyan, chief corporate financial\nofficer at C.A.T. Oil AG, Russia\u2019s largest provider of\nfracturing services. The U.S. has built up about 25 million\nhorsepower for hydraulic fracturing, mostly over the past five\nto seven years, while Russian has at best 850,000 horsepower, he\nsaid.  Production of so-called tight oil in Russia, including\nproduction from the Bazhenov and Priobskoye shales, could total\naround 200,000 barrels a day in 2018, according to the\n International Energy Agency , or IEA, mid-term oil outlook. That\nwill create a steady demand for larger rigs.  \u201cThe number of drilling rigs in Russia that could drill a\n7,000-meter vertical well bore and then shoot off and continue\ndrilling horizontally for another 3 or 4 kilometers in extreme\nwinter weather conditions is quite small,\u201d National Oil\u2019s\nRussia chief Crawford said in an interview. \u201cI could probably\ncount them on one hand.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nStephen Bierman in Moscow at \n sbierman1@bloomberg.net ;\nJake Rudnitsky in Moscow at \n jrudnitsky@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Will Kennedy  at \n wkennedy3@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of National Oilwell Varco, Inc. was 57.05302429199219 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of National Oilwell Varco, Inc. was ",
