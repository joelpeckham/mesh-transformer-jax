 "context": "The following article called 'Cuomo Casino Plan Called a Loser by Las Vegas Sands' was published on 2013-06-06. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLas Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , the company\ncontrolled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson  that is the largest\nU.S.-based casino operator, said it has no interest in expanding\ninto New York under Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s terms.  Cuomo, a 55-year-old Democrat, asked lawmakers yesterday to\nlicense three resorts with gambling in the northern part of the\nstate to enhance tourism and economic development.  No casinos would be allowed within New York City. The\ngambling centers would be permitted in the southern part of the\nstate, including Long Island, five years after the first upstate\nproperty opened. Six potential northern locations were\nidentified including the Saratoga-Capital District and the\nHudson Valley-Catskills area.  \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real understanding of the\ncasino business,\u201d Sands President and Chief Operating Officer\nMichael Leven said yesterday at the company\u2019s annual meeting in\nNew York when an investor asked about expanding into New York.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 20 years past the time where the Catskills would have\nbeen the place to put an integrated resort.\u201d  The upstate markets wouldn\u2019t have enough customers to make\ncasinos very profitable, Leven said.  Adelson, the company\u2019s chairman and chief executive\nofficer, said doing as Cuomo proposes could cost billions of\ndollars, involving convention center space and shopping. Sands\ncouldn\u2019t meet its goal of a 20 percent return on investment, he\nsaid.  Only NYC  \u201cSands does not have a major presence outside of Las Vegas, \nso it\u2019s not surprising they would only want to go to New York \nCity,\u201d Rich Azzopardi, a Cuomo spokesman, said by telephone. \n\u201cHowever, we would be happy to give Mr. Leven a tour of what upstate\nNew York has to offer. There is a lot to New York state outside \nNew York City.\u201d  Cuomo has been negotiating with lawmakers over casino\nlocations since January, when he  announced  plans to put them in\nupstate New York. He\u2019s reached agreements with two casino-operating Indian tribes, the Mohawks near the Canadian border\nand the Oneidas in central New York.  The deals grant exclusivity zones of 10 counties for the\nOneidas and eight for the Mohawks if voters in November approve\na constitutional amendment allowing Las Vegas-style casinos in\nthe third-most populous state. That would eliminate those two\nregions from possible casino development, leaving only four\nareas for the three casinos Cuomo wants.  Tribal Casinos  One of those four is in western New York, where the state\nand the Senecas are feuding over $600 million in tax revenue. If\na deal is struck, that area may also be eliminated from\ncontention, according to Cuomo\u2019s proposal.  The bill Cuomo released yesterday would be subject to\nnegotiations with lawmakers, with a potential deal by the end of\nthe legislative session on June 20. Not every developer shares\nSands\u2019 concerns. Michael Treanor, chief executive officer of\nNevele Investors LLC, which owns the former Nevele Hotel in the\nCatskills, applauded the governor\u2019s plan in a statement.\nExcluding New York City, as well as the proposed 25 percent tax\nrate, make the governor\u2019s proposal attractive, Treanor said in a\nstatement.  \u201cWe are one step closer to bringing real economic recovery\nto Ulster County and the Hudson Valley,\u201d he said.  Sands\u2019 executives said they\u2019d be interested in a New York\nCity casino.  \u201cA lot of what happens in terms of casino locations and\nwhat happens with governments is that they make political\ndecisions and not necessarily what\u2019s best for the state,\u201d Leven\nsaid.  Sands operates a casino 80 miles west of New York City in\nBethlehem,  Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania passed New Jersey to\nbecome the second-largest gambling market in the U.S. after\n Nevada , with revenue of $3.16 billion last year.
