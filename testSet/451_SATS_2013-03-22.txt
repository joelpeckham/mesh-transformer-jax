 "context": "The following article called 'Mexico House Approves Bill to Boost Telecom Competition' was published on 2013-03-22. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nMexico \u2019s lower house of Congress\napproved a modified proposal to increase competition in the\ntelecommunications and media industries, inserting changes that\nbenefit broadcasters  Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO)  and TV Azteca SAB.  The bill was approved 393-98 at 4:11 a.m. local time today\nto be delivered to the Senate, according to the house\u2019s  website .\nIt will require the vote of two-thirds of the Senate. At least\nparts of the legislation will also need constitutional changes,\nwhich have to be approved by a majority of legislatures from 31\nMexican states and the capital.  In a measure to let foreigners own as much as 49 percent of\nMexican broadcast networks, lawmakers  added  a \u201creciprocity\u201d\nclause requiring outside investors to come from countries that\nalso allow stakes of that size in their media industries. That\ncould cut down on investment from companies from the U.S., which\nhas a  restriction  of 25 percent foreign ownership in many cases.  Televisa and Azteca, both based in Mexico City, account for\nalmost all of Mexico\u2019s broadcast-television audience. The\ntelecommunications law calls for creating two new broadcast\nnetworks through an airwave auction. Comcast Corp.\u2019s Telemundo,\na U.S. Spanish-language network, had sought to air in Mexico as\nrecently as 2006, when it was owned by General Electric Co.  \u2018Reciprocal Treatment\u2019  In an  editorial  last year in the Wall Street Journal,\nTelevisa Chairman  Emilio Azcarraga  said his company wouldn\u2019t\nseek to block U.S. investment in Mexican TV networks, \u201cas long\nas we receive reciprocal treatment in the U.S.\u201d Televisa has a\n6 percent stake in Univision Communications Inc., the most-\nwatched Spanish-language broadcaster in the U.S., plus debt that\ncan be converted into a stake of as much as 30 percent.  The bill, proposed March 11 by lawmakers from Mexico\u2019s\nthree biggest political parties and supported by President\nEnrique Pena Nieto, seeks to reduce the dominance of Televisa\nand Azteca in media and of billionaire  Carlos Slim \u2019s America\nMovil SAB in the phone industry.  Televisa rose 0.7 percent to 64.42 pesos at the close in\nMexico City. Azteca gained 0.2 percent to 8.43 pesos.  America\nMovil  climbed 1.9 percent to 12.58 pesos.  The legislation calls for stronger regulatory agencies with\nthe power to force companies to dispose of assets if their\nmarket share is more than 50 percent. Televisa gets 70 percent\nof Mexico\u2019s broadcast audience, and Mexico City-based America\nMovil has 70 percent of its mobile-phone subscribers. The\nproposal also would let foreign companies own landline\ntelecommunications networks for the first time.  Signals Exception  Another new clause inserted by Mexican lower-house\nlawmakers today creates an exception for a requirement that\nbroadcasters offer their signals for free to pay-TV companies.\nIf a company that has been determined to be dominant benefits\nfrom the free signals through a relationship with a third party,\nregulators can revoke the company\u2019s license.  That rule would address the partnership between America\nMovil and Dish Mexico, a satellite-TV joint venture of MVS\nComunicaciones SA and  EchoStar Corp. (SATS)  While Slim\u2019s company\ndoesn\u2019t have a license to offer TV service itself, it has a\nmarketing relationship with Dish Mexico, helping it compete\nagainst the packages of phone, Internet and TV offered by\nTelevisa\u2019s cable units.
