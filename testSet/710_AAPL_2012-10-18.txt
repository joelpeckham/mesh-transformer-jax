 "context": "The following article called 'Apple Loses Appeal Over \u2018Not as Cool\u2019 Samsung Galaxy Tab' was published on 2012-10-18. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc. (AAPL)  lost a U.K. court appeal\nruling over whether Samsung Electronics Co.\u2019s Galaxy tablet\ninfringed the design of the iPad as a judge criticized divergent\nrulings in the global intellectual property fight between the\ntwo companies.  A three-judge panel in London upheld an earlier decision by\na U.K. court that said several of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy tablets\nweren\u2019t \u201ccool\u201d enough to be confused with the iPad. The ruling\ndescribed as \u201cextreme\u201d a German judgment from July granting\nApple a Europe-wide injunction preventing Samsung from selling\none model.  The ruling is the latest in a long line of disputes in\ncourts across the globe as rivals including  HTC Corp. (2498) , Apple and\nSamsung fight for dominance in the smartphone and tablet\ncomputer markets. The cases in the U.S.,  Germany , the\nNetherlands and Spain often lead to conflicting rulings as\njudges apply diverging national laws.  \u201cIf courts around  Europe  simply say they do not agree with\neach other and give inconsistent decisions, Europe will be the\npoorer,\u201d Judge Robin Jacob said in the written ruling.  Samsung said in an e-mailed statement that it continues\n\u201cto believe that Apple was not the first to design a tablet\nwith a rectangular shape and rounded corners.\u201d  \u2018Excessive\u2019 Claims  \u201cShould Apple continue to make excessive legal claims in\nother countries based on such generic designs, innovation in the\nindustry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited,\u201d\nthe company said.  Samsung  shares  rose about 0.7 percent in  London  intraday\ntrading following the ruling and were up 0.4 percent as of 1:18\np.m.  Alan Hely, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment on\ntoday\u2019s ruling.  Apple must also publish notices in U.K. newspapers with\ndetails of the U.K. ruling, Judge David Kitchin said today.  Jacob said a publicity order was necessary to avoid\nconsumer confusion because of the news coverage of the \u201cnot as\ncool\u201d judgment in the U.K. and the contrasting German court\u2019s\ndecision.  A link to the notice must appear on Apple\u2019s website for one\nmonth and the company must publish it in the Financial Times and\nDaily Mail newspapers.  Apple has agreed to ask the German court to \u201cdischarge\u201d\nthe injunction, Jacob said.  Wide Scope  If Apple\u2019s registered design \u201chas a scope as wide\u201d as the\nCupertino, California company says, \u201cit would foreclose much of\nthe market for tablet computers,\u201d Jacob said.  U.K. judges attempt to give \u201cappropriate consideration to\nthe judgments of\u201d foreign courts in related litigation, said\nWill James, a lawyer at Marks & Clerk Solicitors LLP.  \u201cIt is incredibly frustrating for the legal community as a\nwhole, and for IP rights owners in particular -- who rely\nheavily on the courts for commercial certainty -- to see\njudgments that have apparently failed to attempt to apply a\nconsistent approach,\u201d James, who isn\u2019t involved in the case,\nsaid in an e-mail.  Courts around the world have issued divergent rulings in\npatent cases between the two companies. In August, Apple won a\n$1.05 billion U.S. jury verdict in a patent case between the\ncompanies, while a week later a Tokyo court ruled Samsung\nproducts don\u2019t infringe an Apple invention for synchronizing\nmusic and video data with servers.  Australian and Dutch courts have also issued rulings that\ncontrasted with decisions in the U.S. case.
