 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Must Respect Overseas Swaps Rules, CFTC\u2019s Wetjen Says' was published on 2012-09-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S.  Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission , facing concerns from European and Asian regulators\nabout the scope of new swaps rules, should rely on overseas\nauthorities when possible, Commissioner Mark P. Wetjen said.  \u201cIn light of the commission\u2019s limited resources, efficient\nregulation through deference to comparable regulation just makes\nsense,\u201d Wetjen, one of three Democrats on the five-member CFTC,\nsaid today in remarks prepared for delivery at an  International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association Inc.   conference  in New York.  The CFTC\u2019s proposal for the international reach of its\nDodd-Frank Act rules needs more clarity, and it is \u201ccritically\nimportant\u201d that the agency rely on a process of letting firms\ncomply with new rules by substituting adherence to regulations\nenacted abroad, he said.  Along with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the CFTC\nhas been crafting swaps market rules imposed by Dodd-Frank after\nunregulated trades helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The\nrules\u2019 scope has prompted opposition from overseas regulators\nand companies such as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Goldman Sachs Group\nInc. (GS) ,  Bank of America Corp.  and  Societe Generale SA. (GLE)   CFTC Chairman  Gary Gensler  urged support for a June\nproposal, citing the need to protect taxpayers from rescuing\ncompanies whose overseas trades lead to their downfall.  \u201cDuring a default or crisis, the risk that builds up\noffshore inevitably comes crashing back onto U.S. shores, he\nsaid June 29 when the proposal was published for public comment.  The collapse of  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , which\nbooked  credit derivatives  in Europe, and more recent losses by\nLondon traders at JPMorgan\u2019s chief investment office show the\nneed to close potential loopholes in Dodd-Frank, Gensler said.  \u2018Substituted Compliance\u2019  The CFTC\u2019s interpretive guidance allowed for so-called\nsubstituted compliance for branches, subsidiaries and other\noverseas affiliates of U.S. banks when foreign jurisdictions\nhave comparable rules.  \u2018\u2018Permitting substituted compliance is not tantamount to\nabdicating the commission\u2019s responsibilities,\u201d Wetjen said in\nhis prepared remarks for the ISDA conference. \u201cShould a\ncomparability analysis reveal a gap in another jurisdiction\u2019s\nregulations that poses material risk to our markets, our\nfinancial institutions, or our economy, the commission reserves\nthe right to apply Dodd-Frank to swap activities abroad\u201d that\nhave a direct and significant effect on the U.S., he said.  Insufficient Clarity  The CFTC\u2019s June proposal failed to sufficiently clarify the\nreach of the rules and could lead to conflicts, according to\nletters submitted to the agency by overseas regulators. The\nletters were sent by the U.K.\u2019s Financial Services Authority,\nEuropean Commission, European Securities and Markets Authority,\n Financial Services Agency  in  Japan , the  Bank of Japan , Bank of\nFrance and  Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority .  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority,  Monetary Authority of\nSingapore  and the Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios, Brazil\u2019s\nnational securities regulator also submitted letters.  Rules defining U.S. entities in the trades are overly broad\nand could lead to regulatory overlaps, officials with the\nEuropean Commission and the U.K.\u2019s Financial Services Authority\nsaid in letters dated Aug. 24.  \u201cThis will lead to duplication of laws and to potentially\nirreconcilable conflicts of laws for market operators,\u201d said\n Jonathan Faull , the European Commission\u2019s director general for\nfinancial services. \u201cEU and U.S. firms could face permanent\nlegal uncertainty if this issue is not resolved.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nSilla Brush in Washington at \n sbrush@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Maura Reynolds  at \n mreynolds34@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was 30.79570198059082 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of JP Morgan Chase & Co. was ",
