The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSXC Health Solutions Corp. (SXCI)  agreed\nto buy  Catalyst Health Solutions Inc. (CHSI)  in a cash and stock\ntransaction valued at $4.4 billion to stay competitive as larger\npharmacy benefits managers join forces.  Catalyst investors will receive $28 in cash and 0.6606\nshares of SXC stock for each Catalyst share under the terms of\nthe agreement, the companies said today in a statement. That\nimplies a purchase price of $81.02 per Catalyst share, 28\npercent above yesterday\u2019s closing stock prices.  Pharmacy benefits managers are combining after Express\nScripts Inc., the largest one in the U.S., agreed to pay $29.1\nbillion for Medco Health Solutions Inc. SXC of Lisle,  Illinois ,\none of the biggest providers of technology for processing\nprescription claims, was the target of speculation last month.\nThe company is now in position to be one of the nation\u2019s largest\npharmacy benefit companies, said Brian Tanquilut, an analyst\nwith Jefferies & Co. in Nashville,  Tennessee .  \u201cSXC will be the next big player in the PBM space,\u201d\nTanquilut said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe opportunity to\nwin new business from the larger guys, meaning Express-Medco,\nCVS, is there.\u201d  SXC  rose  11 percent to $89.36 at 4 p.m. New York time.\nRockville, Maryland-based Catalyst surged 34 percent to $85.23.\nSXC\u2019s calculation understates the value of the share portion of\nthe deal, and Catalyst is trading at the proper value, according\nto Tanquilut.  Big Four  SXC is targeting the current \u201cbig three\u201d of the PBM world\n--  Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX) ,  CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS)  and\nUnitedHealth Group Inc., hoping to eventually make it a big four\nas his company grows, said SXC Chairman and Chief Executive\nOfficer Mark Thierer.  \u201cWe\u2019ve laid a three to five year plan out for our board,\u201d\nThierer said in an interview today. \u201cI do see SXC moving right\ninto the largest buyers, competing directly\u201d with the biggest\nPBMs, he said.  His company will have \u201ca lot of gunpowder\u201d to do future\ndeals, Thierer said. SXC will target companies that can help\nthem grow is scale, as well as smaller, closely held companies\nwith capabilities in specialty pharmaceuticals like expensive\ninjectable drugs. \u201cI\u2019m expecting continued consolidation\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cPeople have a lot of money on the balance sheet,\nleverage is cheap, I\u2019m expecting a lot more activity,\u201d he said.  Transaction Costs  The enlarged company expects to incur about $40 million to\n$45 million of \u201ctransition expenses\u201d while SXC expects to pay\nannual interest of about $70 million from financing the\ntransaction with $1.7 billion in debt.  Thierer and will continue as CEO and chairman in the\ncombined company.  \u201cWe will be the second-largest independent PBM in the\ncountry, in terms of prescription volume,\u201d Thierer said on a\nconference call today. \u201cThe transaction will expand our reach\nto larger clients.\u201d  The companies have little overlap among clients, with\nCatalyst having many state employers while SXC has state\nMedicaid clients, Thierer said.  \u201cThis catapults SXC and Catalyst into a much better\nnegotiating stance,\u201d said Anthony Vendetti, a Maxim Group LLC\nanalyst in  New York  who follows both companies. \u201cIt gives them\nmore leverage with drug manufacturers and drug distributors and\nbecause of their increased size, it gives them more leverage\nwith clients.\u201d  Seven Acquisitions  SXC made at least seven acquisitions since November 2004,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. Previous to today\u2019s\ndeal, their largest purchase had been Healthtrans LLC for $250\nmillion in January.  \u201cSXC has a history of acquiring companies and integrating\nthem well,\u201d Vendetti said in a telephone interview.  Founded as Systems Xcellence in 1993, SXC negotiates with\ndrugmakers for lower prescription medicine prices on behalf of\nhealth insurers, Medicare and Medicaid plans, workers\u2019\ncompensation programs and long-term care facilities.  SXC also makes software that processed one out of every\nfive drug claims in the U.S, according to the company\u2019s 2010\nannual report. Jefferies\u2019s Tanquilut said that most of the\nacquisitions have been clients who use SXC\u2019s technology.  Tanquilut said the company may take a year to complete the\nintegration, then move on to more deals to keep growing and\ncompete with  Express Scripts  and CVS. The company needs to add\nsmaller assets in specialty pharmaceuticals, most of which will\nprobably be closely held regional companies, he said.  Deal Advisers  JPMorgan Chase & Co. served as lead financial adviser to\nSXC, while Barclays Plc assisted and Sidley Austin LLP provided\nlegal advice. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. took the lead in advising\nCatalyst, with Citigroup Inc. offering additional advice and\nMilbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy acting as legal counsel.  JPMorgan is providing financing to SXC for the cash portion\nof the deal, according to today\u2019s statement.  Express Scripts, which completed the purchase of Medco on\nApril 2 after receiving approval from the Federal Trade\nCommission, is the subject of a lawsuit by trade groups that\nwanted to block the acquisition. St. Louis-based Express Scripts\nhas asked that the lawsuit be dismissed because the trade groups\nwaited too long to file the challenge. The companies agreed to\nthe deal in July.  There have been more than $80 billion in deals in the\npharmacy services industry worldwide over the past 10 years, the\nlargest being Express Scripts\u2019 purchase of Medco, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg. SXC\u2019s offer values Catalyst at 27\ntimes earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and\namortization, the data show. The median in a survey of 10 deals\nover the past decade is about 14.
