 "context": "The following article called 'BP Says U.S. Withholding Evidence of Extent of Oil Spill' was published on 2012-03-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBP Plc (BP/)  said the U.S. government is\nwithholding evidence that would show the oil spill from the\nMacondo well in the Gulf of Mexico was smaller than claimed.  BP has identified 10,000 documents, out of more than 80,000\nthe government sought to suppress, that relate to estimates of\nthe April 2010 spill, the London-based oil producer said in a\nfiling yesterday in federal court in New Orleans. The U.S.\nestimated in August 2010 that 4.9 million barrels of oil, plus\nor minus 10 percent, spilled into the Gulf after a rig exploded.  \u201cDespite the United States\u2019 declaration that it was\n\u2018ground truth,\u2019 the Aug. 2 estimate was in fact the fourth\nofficial estimate\u201d to be released, BP said in the court filing.  BP said March 2 it would pay at least $7.8 billion to\nresolve private plaintiffs\u2019 claims for economic loss, property\ndamage and injuries. A magistrate judge in  New Orleans  today\npredicted a multiphase trial over liability for the spill will\nstill go forward.  David Nicholas, a BP spokesman, declined to comment\nimmediately on the filing. Wyn Hornbuckle, a U.S. Justice\nDepartment spokesman, also declined to comment.  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Feb. 28 that the\nU.S. has a \u201cstrong\u201d case over liability for the explosion that\nripped through the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, killing 11\nworkers and triggering the biggest U.S. offshore oil spill.  Potential Fines  BP may face as much as $17.6 billion in civil pollution\nfines under the U.S. Clean Water Act, based on the government\u2019s\nestimate of barrels spilled.  \u201cThe United States is using a privilege intended to\nprotect discussions and deliberations in advance of policy\ndeterminations to shield documents reflecting discussions and\ndeliberations concerning a factual issue, the amount of oil\ndischarged,\u201d BP said.  The law provides for fines of as much as $1,100 for each\nbarrel of oil spilled as a result of simple negligence, often\ndescribed as a failure to exercise ordinary care. The maximum\nfine will increase to $4,300 a barrel if BP or the other\ndefendants are found to have been grossly negligent, meaning a\nconscious action or omission caused the spill.  BP said \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d requires the disclosure of\ndocuments that may help it in its defense.  \u201cIt is the  United States  that has brought this case,\nseeking large monetary penalties against BP,\u201d the  oil company \nsaid. \u201cWhen the government seeks relief, it is fundamentally\nunfair to allow it to evade discovery.\u201d  \u2018Going Forward\u2019  U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Shushan expects the liability\ncase to proceed, she told lawyers for BP;  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the\nVenier, Switzerland-based owner of the Deepwater Horizon drill\nrig that exploded; and  Halliburton Co. (HAL) , which supplied cement\nfor the rig, as well as attorneys for the federal and several\nstate governments.  \u201cI think we\u2019re going forward with the remainder\u201d of the\nliability case over the explosion, and then the government\u2019s\nenvironmental claims will be heard in a separate phase of the\ntrial on \u201csource control\u201d for the  oil spill , Shushan said at a\nhearing today. \u201cThat\u2019s my position and I\u2019m sticking to it.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019d be very interested in smoking out who wants to go\nforward and why?\u201d BP attorney Rob Gasaway told Shushan.  Closed-Door Meeting  Shushan\u2019s job is to make recommendations on evidentiary\nissues in the case to U.S. District Judge  Carl Barbier , who is\noverseeing the consolidated spill litigation. Barbier is\nscheduled to hold a closed-door meeting with lawyers for the\nparties May 3 to discuss how to proceed with the case.  The accord BP reached this month with businesses and\nindividuals is to be paid from a $20 billion trust set up in\n2010 for victims. BP has set aside $37 billion to cover spill\ncosts.  The case is In re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater\nHorizon in the  Gulf of Mexico  on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Eastern District of  Louisiana  (New Orleans).
