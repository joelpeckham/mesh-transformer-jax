The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSouth African labor unrest in the\nplatinum industry spread to  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world\u2019s \nthird-largest gold producer, halting a second gold mine after\n Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) \u2019s KDC West was stopped 13 days ago.  The strike at Kopanang started late yesterday and no\ndemands have been made by workers,  Alan Fine , a spokesman for \nJohannesburg-based AngloGold, said by phone.  Miners mainly on the country\u2019s platinum belt northwest of\nJohannesburg have bypassed conventional wage-talk routes through \nlabor unions, starting illegal pay strikes and protests that \nhave left at least 46 dead since Aug. 10.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  workers, \nwho halted the Marikana mine for six weeks, secured pay rises \nof more than four times the August inflation rate of 5 percent.  Anglo American Plc (AAL) \u2019s platinum unit, the world\u2019s largest\nproducer of the metal, had set an ultimatum for workers to\nreturn by late Sept. 20. Miners stayed away after the company\nsaid a voluntary suspension of its Rustenburg operations ended\nSept. 18. Spokeswoman Mpumi Sithole said today a statement will\nbe issued later.  \u201cLonmin\u2019s headline pay settlement is the new benchmark for\nmineworkers, and unions are hard-pressed to control the\nnegotiations in this more militant and potentially violent\nstoppage,\u201d Fairfax I.S. Plc said in a note today. \u201cThe stakes \nare very high as failure to reach an agreed deal could result \nin strike-related intimidation, violence and fatalities.\u201d  Wage Review  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the second-largest producer\nof the metal, said it\u2019s undertaking a \u201cfull review\u201d of wages\nas workers made fresh pay demands after the company boosted\nwages in April as part of a deal that ended a six-week strike at\nits Rustenburg operation, the world\u2019s largest platinum mine, in\nJanuary and February.  At AngloGold, the strike is currently confined to a single \nmine, the company said in a statement. AngloGold produces about \n32 percent of its gold in  South Africa , where mining accounts \nfor about 8.8 percent of gross domestic product.  Work stoppages this year have cost the continent\u2019s largest\neconomy 4.5 billion rand ($543 million) in lost output, South\nAfrican President  Jacob Zuma  said in Johannesburg on Sept. 16.\nThe nation produces 75 percent of the world\u2019s platinum.
