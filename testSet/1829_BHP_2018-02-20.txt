The body of the article is as follows:\n    \n0 COMMENTS Everyone knows that breaking up is hard to do. That is especially true when the assets you are bidding farewell to suddenly start looking more attractive.\nAustralian giant BHP, the world\u2019s largest mining company, delivered solid results Tuesday for its first half, showing earnings up 25% excluding a big one-off charge mostly related to the U.S. tax overhaul. (The company\u2019s fiscal year ends in June.) Net debt fell by nearly a quarter, and the company declared an interim dividend of 55 cents a share, up by nearly half from last year. Results from BHP\u2019s copper division were particularly strong: Operating profit more than doubled, and volumes were up 17%.\nAustralian giant BHP delivered solid results Tuesday for its first half.

Its big footprint in oil, unusual for a mining company, should be an advantage now that prices are rebounding: Brent crude is trading at $65 a barrel, almost $20 a barrel higher than the average in the second half of 2016. But BHP\u2019s underlying petroleum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were nearly flat. Onshore U.S. output fell 13%, as the company responded to pressure from activist investors to dial back its commitment to its low-return shale-oil business and Hurricane Harvey disrupted production.\nNew conventional oil projects under development in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere will eventually help boost output again. Meanwhile, BHP can\u2019t fully take advantage of rising oil prices by raising production, although it could get a better price for the shale blocks it has put up for sale, which management estimates break even around $40 a barrel. The company also cut production guidance for its profitable coking-coal division.\nAll of this means that the fate of BHP\u2019s copper division\u2014where profits, output and capital expenditures are all rising rapidly\u2014will be increasingly important to the company\u2019s outlook. For now, buoyant copper prices and excitement over the electric-vehicle revolution are tailwinds.\nIf either of those trends stumbles, BHP\u2019s quest to reinvent itself will get a lot trickier.\nWrite to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was 40.089786529541016 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of BHP Billiton Limited was ",
