The company\u2019s 12-month gross  dividend yield  is 4.38\npercent, versus 3.93 percent for OAO Rostelecom, Russia\u2019s main\nfixed-line phone company.  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , which delayed its 2011\npayout amid a shareholder conflict, yields 6.6 percent.  \u201cMTS is the least risky and the most reliable dividend\nplay in Russian telecoms,\u201d Elina Kulieva, an analyst at OAO\nAlfa Bank who rates MTS hold, said by phone Feb. 22. \u201cThis new\nmethod is even more attractive for investors.
