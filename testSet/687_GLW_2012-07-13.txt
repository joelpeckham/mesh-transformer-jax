 "context": "The following article called 'Duke Ex-CEO Johnson Will Testify on Leadership Switch' was published on 2012-07-13. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFormer Progress Energy Inc. Chief\nExecutive Officer  Bill Johnson  will testify to North Carolina\nregulators about  Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) \u2019s decision to replace him\nhours after the companies combined to create the largest U.S.\nutility owner.  The North Carolina Utilities Commission yesterday ordered\nJohnson and four Duke board members to appear at hearings on\nJuly 19 and 20. Johnson was replaced by Duke Chairman and CEO\nJames Rogers hours after the takeover of Progress closed on July\n2. The executives testified before the merger that Johnson would\nbe CEO while Rogers served as executive chairman.  The hearings are an expansion of the agency\u2019s inquiry,\nfollowing July 10 testimony from Rogers. The commission asked\nformer Progress directors E. Marie McKee and James Hyler Jr. to\nappear on July 19 with Johnson, who will be speaking publicly\nabout his unexpected resignation for the first time. Duke\ndirectors Ann Maynard Gray and Michael Browning were ordered to\nappear July 20.  \u201cOne has to wonder how far the North Carolina commission\nwill take this inquiry,\u201d  Paul Patterson , a New York-based\nanalyst with Glenrock Associates LLC, said in an e-mail\nyesterday. \u201cIssues such as the selection of a company\u2019s chief\nexecutive are traditionally matters left to the board and not\nsecond-guessed by state regulators.\u201d  \u2018Corporate Deceit\u2019  Four former directors of Raleigh, North Carolina-based\nProgress have said they would have opposed the merger had they\nknown Rogers would remain in charge. One former director, John Mullin III, said the CEO switch was \u201ccorporate deceit.\u201d Three\nProgress executives resigned following the CEO shuffle.  North Carolina\u2019s attorney general is investigating whether\nDuke violated any laws with its boardroom maneuver. The\nutilities commission is determining whether it was misled and if\ncustomers were harmed. State law allows the commission to\nrescind, alter or amend its June 29 order approving the merger,\nsaid Sam Watson, the agency\u2019s general counsel.  Duke faces tougher scrutiny from  North Carolina  after\nhaving a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with the commission, said\nRobert Gruber, the state\u2019s utility customer advocate.  \u201cIt will make us suspicious, a little less trusting of\nupper management going forward,\u201d Gruber said in a July 11\ninterview. Duke will probably face extended hearings when it\nseeks rate increases for its two North Carolina utilities later\nthis year, he said.  Takeover Agreement  Duke\u2019s board voted 10-5 to replace Johnson in an executive\nsession July 2, the day the merger closed, Rogers told the\ncommission this week. All votes in favor came from former Duke\nboard members and all opposed were former Progress directors.\nNeither Johnson nor Rogers took part in the meeting.  Both McKee and Hyler voted against. McKee, a former  Corning\nInc. (GLW)  executive and president of the Corning Museum of Glass,\nconsidered resigning after the board vote, according to Mullin.\nShe didn\u2019t respond to voicemails and an e-mail seeking comment\nyesterday.  Hyler is a former chief operating officer for First\nCitizens Bank and now serves as managing director of Raleigh-\nbased Investors Management Corp. Hyler said yesterday he would\nappear before the commission as ordered. He declined to comment\nfurther.  Duke directors Gray and Browning were directed to \u201cprovide\ntestimony addressing the timing of the decision to replace\nJohnson with Rogers,\u201d according to the commission\u2019s order.  Gray is Duke\u2019s lead director and has been on the board of\nDuke and its predecessor companies since 1994. Browning has been\non the board since 1990, according to a U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission filing.  `Lost Confidence'  Rogers told commissioners the Duke board \u201clost\nconfidence\u201d in Johnson during the final weeks of the 18-month\nmerger review. The two management teams clashed over a plan to\naddress antitrust concerns in North and South Carolina and the\nfate of Progress\u2019s shuttered Crystal River 3 nuclear plant,\nhighlighting differences in corporate culture.  Rogers was approached by Gray on June 23 with \u201cconcerns\nabout Johnson,\u201d who had an ``autocratic'' management style, \naccording to his testimony. Gray and Browning asked him about \nreplacing Johnson as CEO of the post-merger company during a \nJune 24 dinner, Rogers said.  Regulators asked Duke to provide by July 31 all employment\ncontracts with Rogers, all board and committee meeting minutes\nfrom July 1, 2010 to today, and all memos, letters, e-mails and\nother written and recorded communications from Rogers to board\nmembers.  Johnson will \u201cgladly attend and answer all the questions\nthe commission members have,\u201d Wade Smith, Johnson\u2019s attorney,\nsaid in an e-mail yesterday.  Browning didn\u2019t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.\nAttempts to reach him by phone yesterday at his Indianapolis\noffice weren\u2019t successful. Gray didn\u2019t respond to a voicemail\nmessage left on her home phone.  \u201cOur focus at Duke Energy is on bringing our two companies\ntogether to harvest our merger\u2019s savings for our customers and\nto deliver value to our shareholders,\u201d  Tom Williams , a\nspokesman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Duke said in an e-\nmail yesterday.
