 "context": "The following article called 'Lehman Raises $4.7 Billion in Second Quarter for Payment' was published on 2012-07-31. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the\ndefunct investment bank, has $8.2 billion of cash available for\ncreditor payments after raising $4.7 billion in the second\nquarter from real estate sales, derivatives and settlement of a\nlawsuit.  Overseen by a new board since its emergence from bankruptcy\nin March, Lehman plans semi-annual distributions, including a\nsecond payment to creditors in September, and is \u201cfocused\u201d on\nmaximizing cash for that purpose, it said in a regulatory filing\nyesterday. Allowed claims for payment have been cut to $303\nbillion from $1.3 trillion originally, with another $58 billion\nthat may be deemed valid, out of disputed claims of $193\nbillion, Lehman said.  Lehman has said it aims to raise $53 billion through 2016\nor so, to pay an average of 18 cents on the dollar on final\nclaims of $300 billion. The company filed the biggest bankruptcy\nin U.S. history in September 2008, listing debt of $613 billion.\nIt made its first payment of $22.5 billion to creditors last\nApril, about 3 \u00bd years after its collapse.  \u201cThe company continues to pursue the objective of value\nmaximization and prompt cash distributions to creditors through\nthe execution of an orderly wind down process and the judicious\nand timely resolution of claims,\u201d Lehman said in the filing.  Targets for Cuts  Among creditors targeted for cuts through litigation are\n JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Lehman said. It has\nreached an agreement in principle with its former brokerage,\n Lehman Brothers Inc ., that would resolve disputes over mutual\nclaims, it said.  Lehman and its affiliates had $21.9 billion in cash and\ninvestments on June 30, with $13.7 billion of it reserved for\ndisputed claims, taxes, and other obligations, including a $2\nbillion deposit with Citigroup. A $504 million reserve for the\ncompany\u2019s thrifts, may be freed up soon, Lehman said.  The company said last week its  cash flow  may reach $40.5\nbillion through 2015 and beyond, or $6 billion more than\npreviously anticipated. The number excludes estimates from\nlitigation and other potential inflows, while including the\n$22.5 billion already paid to creditors.  Lehman paid advisers $16.4 million in June, bringing total\nfees to more than $1.7 billion since it failed. Its chief\nbankruptcy law firm, Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, made $6 million\nin June, bringing total fees from Lehman work to $419 million.  Lehman, run by Chief Executive Officer Richard Fuld when\nits collapse helped bring on the worst economic slump since the\nGreat Depression, settled a fight with creditors in a payment\nplan that allotted more money to derivatives claimants including\n Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and less to bondholders such as Paulson\n& Co. Both groups proposed rival plans to pay Lehman\u2019s debt.  Lehman failed because of too much debt and risky real\nestate investments, according to a bankruptcy examiner\u2019s report.
