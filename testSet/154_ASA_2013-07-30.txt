 "context": "The following article called 'Barclays\u2019s Absa Declines After Missing Earnings Estimates' was published on 2013-07-30. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAbsa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African\nbank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , fell the most in more than a\nyear after first-half earnings per share missed analysts\u2019\nestimates.  The stock slumped 7 percent, the most since June last year,\nto 141 rand by the close in Johannesburg. About 5.6 million\nshares, or almost four times the three-month daily average,\nchanged hands. The six-member FTSE/JSE  Africa  Banks Index  fell \n1.7 percent.  Net income rose to 4.7 billion rand ($479 million) from\n4.17 billion rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based lender\nsaid in a statement today. Earnings per share excluding one-time\nitems rose 8 percent to 6.50 rand, less than the median estimate\nof 7.08 rand by four analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  \u201cOperationally this wasn\u2019t a great result with weak\nmargins and poor top line growth,\u201d Ryan Wibberley, head of\nequity dealing for frontier and  emerging markets  at Investec\nAsset Management, which manages the equivalent of $105 billion,\nsaid in an e-mailed reply to questions. \u201cAbsa\u2019s share price has\nrun hard into these results, putting on 8 percent in the last\nweek as the market maneuvered for the special dividend.\u201d  Absa, the worst-performing stock on the banks gauge this\nyear, losing 14 percent, declared a special dividend for the six\nmonths through June of 7.08 rand per share. Some investor\nexpectations had been \u201coverly ambitious,\u201d Wibberley said.  Revenue Disappointment  The lender\u2019s net interest income rose 5.7 percent to 11.5\nbillion rand, from 10.9 billion rand a year earlier, while non-interest revenue declined 1.9 percent to 8.7 billion rand from\n8.9 billion rand, according to the statement. The bank\u2019s\nrevenues were \u201ca disappointment,\u201d Chief Financial Officer\nDavid Hodnett told a presentation in Johannesburg today.  Absa in December said it would buy the bulk of Barclays\u2019s\nAfrican assets in an all-share deal worth 18.3 billion rand.  The bank plans to spend 1.25 billion rand by 2015 on\nbranches in Africa, Chief Executive Officer  Maria Ramos  told\ninvestors at a presentation in Johannesburg today. The bank is\non track to meet its return-on-equity target of 20 percent by\n2015, she said.  \u201cWe expect mid-single digit loan growth this year and a\nbroadly stable net interest margin,\u201d Absa said.
