 "context": "The following article called 'France Telecom to Sell Swiss Unit to Apax for $2.1 Billion' was published on 2011-12-24. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFrance Telecom SA (FTE)  agreed to sell its\nOrange Switzerland mobile-phone unit to buyout firm Apax\nPartners LLP for 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion), the first\nmajor step in Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard\u2019s plan to\nunload slow-growing European operations.  The deal, which is subject to approval by Swiss\nauthorities, will be submitted to  France Telecom \u2019s board in the\nweek starting Jan. 9, the company said in a statement today.\nLondon-based Apax beat rivals including EQT Partners AB,\nProvidence Equity Partners Inc. and French telecommunications\nbillionaire Xavier Niel, people with knowledge of the\ntransaction said yesterday.  France  Telecom is shedding assets in  Europe , where phone\ncompanies are vying for a shrinking pool of new customers amid\ntightening regulation, to embrace faster-growing markets in\nAfrica and the  Middle East . France\u2019s largest mobile operator is\nalso in talks to sell its Orange Austria unit to Hong Kong-based\n Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , people familiar with the situation said\nin October, and is planning to exit Portugal.  \u201cIt makes sense to exit the difficult Swiss market and may\ngive them more flexibility on the cash-flow side,\u201d said\nGiovanni Montalti, a London-based analyst at Credit Agricole\nCheuvreux. The deal will leave France Telecom with European\noperations in countries including Spain, Poland, and the U.K.,\nalong with its home market, while its emerging-market footprint\nincludes Kenya, Cameroon, and Tunisia.  Perella Weinberg Partners LP and  Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  advised France\nTelecom on the Swiss sale. EQT and Providence couldn\u2019t\nimmediately be reached for comment.  Apax Deals  Apax has participated in more than 20 deals this year,\nincluding last month\u2019s $6.5 billion buyout of U.S. wound-\ntreatment company Kinetic Concepts Inc., its largest in 2011,\naccording to Bloomberg data. The firm has amassed about half the\n9 billion euros it\u2019s seeking for its latest fund, three people\nwith knowledge of the plans said this month.  France Telecom\u2019s decision to exit  Switzerland  follows an\nattempt to merge its operations there with rival Sunrise that\nwas rejected by competition regulators last year. Sunrise\u2019s\nowner, London-based  CVC Capital Partners , was excluded from the\nOrange Switzerland sale process, although the firm discussed\nassisting Providence with arranging financing in the hopes of\nattempting another merger, people with knowledge of the talks\nhave said.  A combination of Orange Switzerland with Sunrise would\nleave the country of about 8 million residents with just two\nmobile operators: the merged entity and  Swisscom AG (SCMN) , the former\nSwiss phone monopoly. By comparison, the U.K., Germany and Italy\nall have four full-service mobile-network providers.  Orange Suisse  Today\u2019s deal values Orange Switzerland, which had revenue\nof 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.39 billion) last year, at 6.5\ntimes its estimated 2011 earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization, according to France Telecom. That\ncompares with a median Ebitda multiple of 5.6 paid for Western\nEuropean telecommunications assets in the last 3 years,\nBloomberg data show.  Europe\u2019s mobile operators are struggling to find avenues\nfor growth as mobile penetration reaches its maximum and\neconomic uncertainty crimps  consumer spending .  Telefonica SA (TEF) \nthis month cut its dividend for the first time in a decade,\nciting worsening market conditions, while France Telecom\nreported a 6 percent decline in third-quarter profit as a\nrevenue decline at home overshadowed stronger performances in\nAfrica.  Protect Dividend  The French company\u2019s shares have fallen 23 percent this\nyear, outpacing a 15 percent decline in the Bloomberg Europe\nTelecommunications Index, valuing it at about 32 billion euros.\nStill, in October France Telecom raised its outlook for\noperating cash flow this year, and has pledged to protect its\ndividend.  Almost half the mobile operator\u2019s 45.5 billion euros in\nsales last year came from France. In October, France Telecom\nagreed to acquire Congolese mobile operator Congo-China Telecom,\nentering its third new country in about a year after earlier\ndeals in Morocco and  Iraq .
