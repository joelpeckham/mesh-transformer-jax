 "context": "The following article called 'ICBC Posts 27% Profit Gain, Plans Stake Purchase in Axa Unit' was published on 2010-10-28. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIndustrial & Commercial Bank of\nChina Ltd. , the world\u2019s largest lender by market value, posted a\n27 percent gain in third-quarter profit and agreed to acquire\ncontrol of Axa SA\u2019s local unit to add non-banking revenue.  Net income climbed to 42.6 billion yuan ($6.4 billion) from\n33.6 billion yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based company said\nin a statement yesterday. The lender will invest 1.2 billion\nyuan for a 60 percent  stake  in Axa\u2019s insurance venture with\nChina Minmetals Corp., President  Yang Kaisheng  said at a press\nconference in Beijing.  The  profit  growth, driven by a 14.7 percent increase in\nlending in the first nine months of 2010, may help cement ICBC\u2019s\nposition as the world\u2019s most profitable bank for a third year.\nThe lender is branching into insurance to reduce dependence on\n loans  amid government efforts to curb credit growth and contain\ndefaults after record lending in 2009.  \u201cChinese banks have been reporting sound earnings in the\npast two years and the trend may be sustained in the near\nfuture,\u201d said  May Yan , a Hong Kong-based analyst at Barclays\nCapital. Still, \u201cthe market is preoccupied with concerns of\nloan quality and overhang of regulatory requirements: that also\nexplains why they need to look for other avenues of growth.\u201d  Shares of ICBC have dropped 3 percent in Hong Kong this\nyear, underperforming the 6 percent advance in the benchmark\n Hang Seng Index . The stock gained 0.7 percent to close at\nHK$6.24 yesterday, before the earnings announcement.  Banks\u2019 Profits  ICBC\u2019s quarterly profit was in line with the 42.8 billion\nyuan median  estimate  of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Smaller rival Bank of Communications Ltd. yesterday posted\na 24 percent gain in third-quarter  profit  to 9.18 billion yuan.\nThat compared with the 9.5 billion yuan median  estimate  of seven\nanalysts. Bank of China Ltd. and Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.\non Oct. 27 reported almost 30 percent earnings growth, trumping\nestimates, as lending expanded 13 percent.  The banks\u2019 profit growth may slow as the government and\ncentral bank take steps to curb accelerating inflation and\nprevent  asset bubbles  in the nation. China\u2019s central bank raised\ninterest rates last week and boosted reserve requirements at the\nbiggest lenders two weeks ago after the  economy  grew 9.6 percent\nin the third quarter.  The banking regulator may also require the nation\u2019s most\nimportant lenders to boost their capital adequacy ratio to as\nhigh as 15 percent by the end of 2012, and to maintain loan-loss\nreserves equivalent to at least 2.5 percent of total lending by\nthen, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month.  \u2018Default Risks\u2019  \u201cChina banks will face greater pressure from policies on\ncapital supplement, risk coverage, extraction of counter-\ncyclical capital and excess capital,\u201d Nomura International Hong\nKong Ltd. analysts led by  Lucy Feng  wrote in an Oct. 22 note.\n\u201cBanks will have to cope with the greater potential default\nrisks that can follow on from rapid loan growth.\u201d  ICBC plans to provide distribution, sales network and risk\nmanagement capabilities to the insurance venture, in which\nParis-based Axa, Europe\u2019s second-biggest insurer, will own a\n27.5 percent stake and China Minmetals will hold 12.5 percent.\nThe premium income for Axa-Minmetals, set up in 1999, rose 56\npercent in the first eight months of the year.  The Chinese bank also plans to  raise  as much as 45 billion\nyuan from a rights offer in Shanghai and Hong Kong this year.\nThe bank last month sold 25 billion yuan of convertible bonds,\nlifting its capital adequacy ratio to 11.57 percent as of Sept.\n30 from 11.34 percent in June.  Fee Income  Net interest income, or revenue from lending minus interest\npayments on deposits, climbed 26 percent to 78.4 billion yuan in\nthe third quarter as the  profit margin  on loans expanded, ICBC\nsaid. Net fee and commission income from products and services\nsuch as credit cards, wealth management and insurance\nsales rose 33 percent to 17.7 billion yuan.  ICBC set aside 8.24 billion yuan against potential soured\ndebt in the past three months, compared with 4.41 billion yuan a\nyear earlier. The lender\u2019s bad loans declined to 75.7 billion\nyuan by September, accounting for 1.15 percent of  total advances .  ICBC may earn $23.9 billion this year, compared with $16.5\nbillion at JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to the average\nestimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  -- Luo Jun , with assistance from  Eva Woo  and  Zhang Dingmin  in\nBeijing, and  Helen Yuan  in Shanghai.
