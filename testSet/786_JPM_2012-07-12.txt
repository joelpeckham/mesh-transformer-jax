 "context": "The following article called 'BOJ Refrains From Adding Stimulus, Spurring Stock Decline' was published on 2012-07-12. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe  Bank of Japan  refrained from\nexpanding monetary stimulus as signs of strength in the domestic\neconomy outweighed the threat from Europe\u2019s debt crisis.  The bank expanded its asset-purchase program to 45 trillion\nyen ($564 billion) from 40 trillion yen, according to a policy\nstatement released in Tokyo today. Seven of 17 economists\nsurveyed by Bloomberg News predicted monetary easing. The loan\nfacility was cut to 25 trillion yen from 30 trillion yen.  Stocks fell after the decision, which followed South\nKorea\u2019s central bank unexpectedly lowering borrowing costs today\nand  China  cutting  interest rates  last week. Japanese Finance\nMinister  Jun Azumi  this morning called for the central bank to\ndo more to boost the world\u2019s third-biggest economy and meet a 1\npercent inflation goal.  \u201cThis is simply a technical move that shouldn\u2019t be\nconsidered to be monetary easing,\u201d said Masaaki Kanno, chief\neconomist at JPMorgan Securities  Japan  Co. in Tokyo, and a\nformer BOJ official. \u201cSome market participants will be\ndisappointed to see that the BOJ didn\u2019t ease policy.\u201d  The central bank this month raised its economic evaluation\nof all regions for the first time in more than two years, citing\nimprovements in  consumer spending  and rebuilding demand from\nlast year\u2019s earthquake.  Bond-Buying  The yen traded at 79.34 as of 5:52 p.m. in  Tokyo . The\nNikkei 225 Stock Average closed 1.5 percent lower, falling for a\nsixth day.  Underscoring the difficulty in executing its stimulus\nefforts, the central bank failed on July 10 to attract enough\nbids in a six-month credit lending operation for the 14th\nstraight time, following a failure of a regular monthly bond-\nbuying operation last week.  The BOJ said it will buy more treasury bills and remove the\nminimum bidding yield for the securities, moves that may smooth\nits operations after failures at some auctions.  Japan\u2019s central bank kept its benchmark  interest rates \nbetween zero and 0.1 percent and monthly bond purchases at 1.8\ntrillion yen, the bank said in the statement today. At a press\nbriefing, Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said that the BOJ won\u2019t cut\ninterest rates on commercial lenders\u2019 excess reserves because of\nthe potential adverse affect on liquidity.  Extra Easing  \u201cThe BOJ cut the amount of the credit-loan program because\nthere were a lot of failures,\u201d said  Junko Nishioka , chief\neconomist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo and a former\ncentral bank official. \u201cAdditional easing will depend on\nexternal factors, such as a worsening European crisis or a\nslowdown in the U.S.\u201d  The  Bank of England  raised its asset-purchase target by 50\nbillion pounds ($78 billion) on July 5, the day the ECB and\nPBOC\u2019s eased and two weeks after the U.S. Federal Reserve\nexpanded a program lengthening the maturity of bonds it holds.  Tokyo-based  Bridgestone Corp. (5108) , the world\u2019s biggest maker of\ntires, may extend output cuts in the second half as Europe\u2019s\ndebt crisis and China\u2019s slowdown curb demand, Masaaki Tsuya,\nchief executive officer, said in an interview on June 21.  The  International Monetary Fund  will reduce its estimate\nfor global growth this year, Managing Director  Christine Lagarde \nsaid on July 6, citing weakness in investment, jobs and\nmanufacturing in Europe, the U.S., Brazil, India and China.  Japan\u2019s benchmark 10-year bond yields fell to 0.765 percent\nas of 4:32 p.m., the lowest since 2003. Europe\u2019s debt woes have\nspurred demand for Japanese assets, regarding as a relatively\nsafe haven in times of global turmoil.  The BOJ today kept its inflation outlook at 0.7 percent for\nthe year starting April 2013 after setting a price goal of 1\npercent in February. The bank expects 2.2 percent economic\ngrowth this fiscal year and 1.7 percent in the following 12\nmonths.
