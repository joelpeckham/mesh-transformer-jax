The record amount agreed by a tribunal so far is 5.1 million pounds for PwC over its audit of RSM Tenon. \nClarke recommended an increase in fines to 10 million pounds or more for seriously poor audit work from a Big Four accounting firm, meaning PwC, KPMG, EY and Deloitte, who check the books of most international blue-chip companies. \nThe FRC also accepted other recommendations from Clarke to make greater use of non-financial penalties and to exclude dishonest auditors from the accounting profession for at least 10 years. \nHowever, fines will be discounted in line with the level of cooperation during an investigation to encourage early settlement, the FRC said. \nA 10 million pound fine is still small compared with penalties imposed by Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority for breaches of financial rules. \nBritain\u2019s ICAEW accounting industry body has already warned that exacting retribution through big fines could harm the marketplace by prompting some firms to quit auditing.
