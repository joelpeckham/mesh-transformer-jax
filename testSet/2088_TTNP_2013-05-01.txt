The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTitan Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TTNP)  plunged the\nmost in 17 years after the company failed to win U.S. regulatory\napproval for an implant to treat addiction to heroin and\nprescription painkillers.  Titan fell 74 percent to 43 cents at 4 p.m.  New York  time,\nthe biggest drop since January 1996 when the company began\noffering public shares. The Food and Drug Administration asked\nfor more information to prove the matchstick-size implant called\nProbuphine for opioid dependence works, the company said in a\nstatement yesterday. The FDA wants additional data on the effect\nof higher doses of Probuphine and training for doctors on\ninsertion and removal of the implant.  Probuphine may generate $360 million in sales in 2018,\nMichael Higgins, an analyst for Brinson Patrick Securities\nCorp., said in an e-mail before the rejection. Titan, based in\nSouth San Francisco,  California , licensed the U.S. and Canadian\nrights to Apple Tree Partners\u2019 Braeburn Pharmaceuticals. Titan\nis eligible for a $50 million milestone payment on approval.  \u201cTitan and our partner, Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, are\nextremely surprised and disappointed with the FDA\u2019s response,\u201d\nMarc Rubin, executive chairman of Titan, said in the statement.  Titan believes Probuphine demonstrated both safety and\nefficacy and meets a \u201ccritical need for new safe and effective\ntreatments that reduce the likelihood of abuse, diversion and\naccidental pediatric exposure,\u201d Rubin said.  Titan plans to discuss the rejection with the FDA to obtain\nclarification and determine next steps.  Drug Abuse  More than 12 million people reported using prescription\npainkillers recreationally or without a prescription, according\nto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drugs\nwere involved in 14,800 overdose deaths in 2008, more than\ncocaine and heroin combined, the Atlanta-based CDC said.  A panel of FDA advisers that gave Probuphine a positive\nrecommendation in March raised concern that the dose of the\nactive ingredient, buprenorphine, may have been too low and\nquestioned the adequacy of the physician training program.  Addicts now can use Slough, England-based  Reckitt Benckiser\nGroup Plc (RB/) \u2019s Suboxone dissolvable film that combines\nbuprenorphine with the drug naloxone, which is used to reverse\nthe effects of overdose.  Orexo AB (ORX) , a Swedish biotechnology\ncompany, is awaiting an FDA decision in July on its experimental\ntablet Zubsolv that dissolves under the tongue  for opioid\ndependence.
