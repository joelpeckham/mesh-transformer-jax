The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nSmiths Group Plc is raising 300\nmillion euros ($400 million) from its first sale of bonds in the\ncurrency as the world\u2019s biggest maker of security scanners for\nairports seeks to extend the maturity of its existing debt.  \n The seven-year notes will be priced to yield 135 basis\npoints more than the benchmark swap rate, according to a person\nwith knowledge of the transaction. That compares with 123 basis\npoints on average for companies with ratings similar to the\nLondon-based company\u2019s BBB+ grade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nindex data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  \n \u201cSmiths\u2019s new bond offers some pick up in comparison to\ndeals from similar companies, which should help to entice\ninvestor demand,\u201d said Maureen Schuller, a credit strategist at\nING Groep NV in Amsterdam.  \n Demand for corporate assets has helped shrink BBB rated\ndebt yields to near the lowest in more than two years, down from\na peak of 420 basis points in January 2009, Merrill Lynch data\nshow. The drop in yields has helped spur a surge in sales by\nfirst-time issuers to more than 9 billion euros this year, the\nmost since at least 2006, Societe Generale SA data show.  \n Smiths will use the proceeds from the issue to help\nrefinance 150 million pounds ($230 million) of 7.875 percent\nbonds due this year, said spokesman Colin McSeveny in London.\nThe notes will also extend the company\u2019s debt profile, he said.  \n Smiths has sold debt in dollars and pounds, most recently\nissuing $250 million of five-year notes in May, according to\ndata compiled by Bloomberg.  \n \u201cSmiths is a fairly well-known name with a good reputation\nwithin the technology sector,\u201d said Simon Ballard, a senior\ncredit strategist at RBC Capital Markets in London. \u201cThese\ntypes of credits should offer investors relative performance and\ncapital preservation.\u201d  \n The pipeline of this year\u2019s debut bond issuers is growing.\nGroupe SEB, the French kitchen appliance maker, plans to sell\nbonds for the first time in euros, said a banker involved in the\ntransaction, who declined to be identified before a sale is\ncompleted. The Ecully, France-based company will meet with\ninvestors starting May 3 in Paris.  \n To contact the reporters on this story:\nCaroline Hyde in London \n chyde3@bloomberg.net ;  \n          \n          \n\n\n  \n     \n       \n     \n           \n                            \n                     \n                     Pedestrians pass the Bank of Spain in Madrid in this file photo.
