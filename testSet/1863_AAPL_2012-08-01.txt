 "context": "The following article called 'Apple v Samsung: Can Look and Feel Be Patented?' was published on 2012-08-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGet ready for \u201crubberbanding.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the way the screen on an iPad or iPhone seems to bounce\nwhen you scroll to the bottom of a file -- and it\u2019s among the\nterms jurors must understand as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and Samsung\nElectronics Co. face off in a patent trial this week.  Apple has become the most valuable company by creating\nproducts that stand out for design and ease of use, stemming\nfrom scores of smaller innovations, such as rubberbanding,\nrather than epic underlying technology breakthroughs.  In the trial in federal court in San Jose,  California ,\nApple will try to prove to jurors that its brand of innovation\nis not only effective in the marketplace, but also defensible in\na courtroom.  \u201cEveryone has a sense that Apple does something\ndifferent,\u201d said Cheryl Milone,  chief executive officer  at\nArticle One Partners, which makes software used to prove or\ndisprove intellectual property claims. \u201cWhether those\ndifferences can be protected in court is the question.\u201d  As consumers move en masse from older, limited-feature\nhandsets to computer-like smartphones, the trial could have a\nbig impact on one of the largest, fastest-growing areas of\ntechnology, said  Chris Jones , an  analyst  at Canalys. If Apple\nwere to win, Samsung could be forced to scale back features in\nits handsets, making them less attractive to consumers.  A victory could also help Apple hobble another important\nfoe: Android, the operating system that Google Inc. gives away\nto manufacturers and Samsung uses on key products. Google\u2019s\napproach threatens Apple\u2019s pitch to consumers that its exclusive\nofferings are different and better.  Engineering Patents  Courts historically have given greater protection to\nengineering-based innovations that create an entirely new way of\naccomplishing a task, said Milone, who practiced as a patent\nattorney before founding Article One. If granted, these so-\ncalled utility patents protect the inventor from copying for 20\nyears after the first filing.  Apple alleges that Samsung has infringed three such\npatents. One is for rubberbanding, and another relates to how\nusers can double-tap a Web page or photo to zoom in.  What sets Apple\u2019s case apart is the company\u2019s focus on\nprotecting design patents, which relate to the look and feel of\nits mobile products. The four in the  San Jose  trial cover such\nthings as the placement of the on-off button on the iPad and\niPhone and the devices\u2019 flat, edge-to-edge glass fronts. One of\nthe patent documents consists of little more than nine drawings\nof a rectangular tablet, with no dimensions.  Subjective Opinions  Design patents  carry  a term of 14 years and are often\nharder to defend than engineering patents because cases often\nhinge on more subjective opinions. Also, companies can often\nmake relatively easy cosmetic changes to their products to avoid\ninfringement.  In a countersuit being heard in the same case, Samsung\nclaims that Apple is infringing five patents, including two that\ninvolve basic telecommunications technology that let mobile\nphones talk to each other.  Apple\u2019s patent portfolio shows the weight the company puts\non design-based innovations. While just 2.7 percent of patents\ngranted to technology companies are design patents, 13.4 percent\nof Apple\u2019s 5,452 patents fall into this category, according to\n MDB Capital Group LLC , which maintains a patent database. Of the\n359 patents listing Apple\u2019s late co-Founder  Steve Jobs  as an\ninventor, 86 percent are for design.  \u201cApple patents the things that they think make Apple\nspecial,\u201d said Bob Borchers, a venture capitalist who used to\nwork at Apple. \u201cThey focus on the consumer\u2019s experience.\u201d  Microsoft Prevails  The company\u2019s previous efforts to win protection for such\nadvances has been mixed. In 1992, Apple lost a copyright-\ninfringement suit aimed at preventing  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  from using\ngraphical features of the Macintosh in Windows. The setback\nopened the market to Windows machines from companies such as\n Dell Inc. (DELL)  and  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)   When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, Jobs said his\ncompany filed for 200 patents to protect the invention. Apple\nhas been aggressive in asserting those, and has won bans on\nsales of versions of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy tablet in  Australia  and\nthe European Union. In the current trial, U.S. District Judge\nLucy Koh granted an injunction preventing sale of the tablet in\nthe U.S.  Apple is setting a high price for its patents in court.\nIt\u2019s asking for $2.5 billion, or as much as $7.5 billion if\njurors believe punitive damages are warranted.  Even $2.5 billion works out to about $31 for each device\nsold by Samsung. Apple ascribes $24 of that $31 to Samsung\u2019s\nmisuse of its design patents. In its countersuit, Samsung is\nasking Apple to pay $14 for each infringing device.  Apple\u2019s Challenge  As complicated as the case may be, Apple will try to\nconvince jurors of one essential idea: Its Korean rival is a\ncopycat. Samsung will contend that none of Apple\u2019s design\nflourishes are totally novel, and that offering patent\nprotection to the rectangular shape and flat front surface of\nits products would unfairly limit competition.  \u201cSamsung is on trial because it made a deliberate decision\nto copy Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad,\u201d Apple said in the opening\nline of its key pretrial filing with the court. \u201cTry as it\nmight,\u201d Apple said, \u201cSamsung cannot deflect attention from its\nown copying by the patents it has asserted against Apple.\u201d  In its filing, Samsung answered that a lot of competing\nproducts appear similar.  \u201cIn this lawsuit,\u201d the company said, \u201cApple seeks to\nstifle legitimate competition and limit consumer choice to\nmaintain its historically exorbitant profits.\u201d  Hard Defense  Apple may have an advantage in that Koh is a former\nintellectual property lawyer who has been willing to consider\nthe company\u2019s argument. She granted the preliminary injunction\non Samsung\u2019s tablet, and hasn\u2019t referred to a recent ruling by\n Richard Posner , the federal judge who in June dismissed a suit\nbetween Apple and Google\u2019s Motorola Mobility because neither\ncould prove that it had been damaged economically.  To prevail in San Jose, Apple will need to persuade jurors\n-- and that won\u2019t be easy, even in a case being heard just a few\nmiles from its headquarters, said Kevin Rivette,  managing\npartner  at 3LP Advisors LLC and a former vice president of\nintellectual-property strategy for International Business\nMachines Corp.  \u201cDesign patents are supposed to be hard to defend,\u201d\nRivette said. \u201cIf you could stop everyone by patenting a\nrectangular phone, then Motorola could have done it years ago\nand none of this ever would have happened.\u201d  The case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-\ncv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California\n(San Jose).
