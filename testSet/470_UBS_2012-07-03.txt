 "context": "The following article called 'Wen Eases Off as China\u2019s Cities Seek to Revive Home Sales' was published on 2012-07-03. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nLiu Xuejun, a building-equipment\ndealer, couldn\u2019t restock his  Shanghai  showroom fast enough in\n2009 as he sold an excavator every three days. Now he might wait\nsix months between sales.  \u201cScheduled property construction work just doesn\u2019t kick\noff,\u201d said Liu, 41, as he stood amid dozens of yellow\nexcavators and wheel loaders in the showroom of Shanghai Wo You\nConstruction Machinery Co. on the eastern outskirts of the city.  Liu\u2019s sales are a casualty of an economic slowdown tied to\n China \u2019s efforts since 2010 to prevent a housing bubble with\ncurbs on lending and property ownership. Now, outgoing Premier\n Wen Jiabao  is tolerating some piecemeal measures to support the\nmarket. They include the introduction in May of home subsidies\nin the eastern city of Yangzhou, discounts on mortgages for\nfirst-home buyers in Beijing, and raising the tax threshold on\npurchases of some homes in Shanghai.  \u201cThe easing is happening now and it\u2019s going to keep\nhappening,\u201d said  Michael Klibaner , Shanghai-based head of China\nresearch at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. \u201cIf you would try to get\nprices to drop suddenly, that would be a really scary and\ndangerous thing for both the economy and Wen\u2019s legacy.\u201d  About 30 Chinese cities have issued \u201cfine-tuning\u201d\npolicies since the second half of 2011, according to  Centaline\nProperty Agency Ltd. , the nation\u2019s biggest real estate brokerage.\nChina\u2019s  home prices  fell in a record 54 of 70 cities tracked by\nthe government in May from a year ago as developers cut prices\nto boost sales, the government said on June 18.  Land sales made up about 26 percent of local government\nrevenue last year and in some cities account for more than half,\naccording to Zurich-based UBS AG.  Buyer Subsidies  While the government has said it won\u2019t waver from its curbs,\nit\u2019s being more lenient toward attempts by local municipalities\nto increase property sales. That\u2019s a departure from February,\nwhen Wuhu in Anhui province had to reverse measures to kickstart\nflagging housing sales within a week of announcing them. In\nOctober, Foshan in the south quickly backtracked on its own\neasing steps.  Yangzhou in Jiangsu province will offer new buyers\nsubsidies of as much as 0.6 percent of the value of a home,\nXinhua Daily reported in May, citing the local finance bureau.  The central city of Wuhan said in April that it would allow\ndown payments as low as 20 percent for some first-time buyers,\nusing loans from the public housing fund into which they must\npay a portion of their income each month to qualify for low-\ninterest mortgages. That was compared with a 30 percent down-\npayment requirement for first homes nationwide.  Shares Rise  China\u2019s central government may not introduce new measures\nto curb the nation\u2019s  property market  as it continues to place\nits priority on stabilizing the market, 21st Century Business\nHerald reported today, citing Chen Guoqiang, vice chairman of\nthe China Real Estate Society.  A  gauge  tracking property shares on the  Shanghai Composite\nIndex (SHCOMP)  rose 1.7 percent at the local close, the most in three\nweeks and the biggest gain among the five industry groups on the\nbenchmark.  Some developers in cities including Nanjing, Shenzhen,\nGuangzhou and Wuhan have been allowing first-home buyers to\ndelay their down payments to boost sales, the China Business\nNews reported in February.  The Shanghai city government is taxing sales of properties,\nif they are the only ones owned by a family, for less than 3.3\nmillion  yuan  ($519,700) at half the standard rate. That\u2019s up\nfrom a ceiling of 2.45 million yuan.  New Buyers  Lenders in Beijing are giving first-home buyers mortgages\nat a 15 percent discount to the 6.8 percent benchmark rate after\nthe central bank reduced borrowing costs, said Wu Hao, a manager\nat the loan brokerage of Bacic & 5i5j Group, Beijing\u2019s second-\nbiggest real estate broker. In the second half of 2011, they\npaid 5 percent to 10 percent more than the benchmark, she said.  \u201cThe central government certainly doesn\u2019t want the\nproperty market to fall sharply as it\u2019s concerned about economic\ngrowth,\u201d said Yao Wei, a Hong Kong-based economist at  Societe\nGenerale  SA. \u201cIt is actually tolerating some of the fine-tuning\nby local governments. We are likely to see more of that.\u201d  Property, construction and related industries increased to\naccount for about 20 percent of China\u2019s gross domestic product\non average after 2008, according to estimates from Societe\nGenerale.  Economic Growth  China is targeting a 7.5 percent expansion in gross\ndomestic product this year, down from the 8 percent goal in\nplace since 2005. Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG\nlast month cut their 2012 economic growth targets for China to\nbelow 8 percent. Credit Suisse said the property sector remained\nthe major \u201cswing\u201d factor to its current forecasts.  About 93 percent of construction companies surveyed by\nCredit Suisse in May said they experienced payment delays from\nproperty developers, up from 80 percent six months ago.  \u201cThis reflects a deteriorating financial situation for the\nproperty industry value chain,\u201d  Du Jinsong , a Hong Kong-based\nproperty analyst at the Swiss bank, said as he released his\ntwice-yearly survey of China\u2019s construction industry in May.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (914) , China\u2019s biggest maker of the\nbuilding material, reported a 44 percent slump in first-quarter\nprofit, while  Angang Steel Co. (347) , a steelmaker based in Anshan in\nLiaoning province, swung to a first-quarter loss.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service estimates that 29 Chinese\ndevelopers on its rating list, including Hopson Development\nHoldings Ltd., Greentown China Holdings Ltd. and Shanghai Zendai\nProperty Ltd., need to repay 159 billion yuan of short-term debt\nthis year, the most in data going back to 2008, according to a\nMay 23 report.  New Construction  China\u2019s new property construction fell 4.3 percent in the\nfirst five months from a year ago to 729 million square meters\n(7.8 billion square feet), according to the statistics bureau.\nThat compared with a 23.8 percent increase in the same period a\nyear ago. Property investment growth from January to May slowed\nto 18.5 percent compared with a 34.6 percent rise a year ago.  Meanwhile, the government has been accelerating the\nbuilding of low-cost housing in a year when the ruling Communist\nParty is preparing for a once-per-decade transition to a younger\ngeneration of leaders from Wen, 69, this year.  China plans to begin construction of 7 million social\nhousing units this year after 10 million were started in 2011.\nIt will build 36 million units by 2014, aiming for the homes to\ncomprise 20 percent of the entire residential market.  Relax Curbs  \u201cIf the government is confident in achieving the target of\nsocial housing, then they should gradually relax the housing\ncurbs,\u201d said Liu Li-Gang, a Hong Kong-based economist at\nAustralia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. \u201cWith the big\nincrease of supply, fine-tuning the housing curbs will quickly\nboost demand and avoid a big slump for  China\u2019s economy .\u201d  Property prices in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy\nsurged 32 percent in the two years after the government\u2019s 2008,\n4 trillion yuan stimulus package introduced in the midst of the\nglobal financial crisis. To keep housing affordable, the\ngovernment increased down-payment requirements and  mortgage\nrates  for some apartments, and set a limit on the number of\nhomes each family was allowed to buy.  The Housing Ministry said last month it won\u2019t flip-flop on\npolicies, the Shanghai Securities Journal reported, while the\nState Council, China\u2019s Cabinet, pledged in April to stick with\nits existing property controls.  Key Policy  \u201cThe government may fine-tune a bit, but won\u2019t ease\nproperty curbs as home price declines is a key policy\nobjective,\u201d Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based senior\neconomist and strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, said in an e-\nmail.  That was evident last week when the central province of\nHenan denied a 21st Century Business Herald report that the\nlocal government had asked banks to offer discounts of as much\nas 30 percent on mortgages for first-home buyers. The province\nhad canceled a plan to introduce the measure, the newspaper said.  The People\u2019s Bank of China cut the benchmark one-year\nlending rate to 6.31 percent from 6.56 percent on June 7,\naccelerating efforts to combat a deepening slowdown. It was the\nfirst rate reduction since 2008.  That is not enough to revive the housing market, said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd.  \u201cMore decisive easing of the property measures is needed,\notherwise it will have a huge impact on China\u2019s economy,\u201d said\nHong Kong-based Shen. \u201cEasing of monetary policy is not enough\nbecause it\u2019s still difficult for developers or local\ngovernment\u2019s financial vehicles to borrow from banks.\u201d  Price Rebound  Still, home prices in June rose for the first time in 10\nmonths, according to a survey of 100 cities by SouFun Holdings\nLtd., the nation\u2019s biggest real estate website owner.  The nation\u2019s home sales rebounded for the first time this\nyear in May, rising 19 percent to 375.7 billion yuan from the\nprevious month, according to the statistics bureau.  Evergrande\nReal Estate Group Ltd. (3333) , the country\u2019s biggest developer by sales\nvolume, posted a 33 percent rise in sales to a record 10.4\nbillion yuan in May from a year earlier.  The housing curbs will remain \u201ctight\u201d this year,\npreventing transactions and prices from rebounding significantly,\nFreddy Lee, chief executive officer of Shanghai-based Shui On\nLand Ltd., said last week in an interview.  For Liu, who has been selling construction machinery for a\ndecade, is grappling with two of his clients who placed deposits\nfor excavators several months ago and have delayed the full\npayment as they push back housing projects in Shanghai\u2019s\nChongming Island, he said.  \u201cI can\u2019t do much about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just have to\nseek out more non-property-related clients.\u201d  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:\nBonnie Cao in Shanghai at \n bcao4@bloomberg.net ;\nJasmine Wang in  Hong Kong  at \n jwang513@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nAndreea Papuc at \n apapuc1@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was 7.56115198135376 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of UBS AG was ",
