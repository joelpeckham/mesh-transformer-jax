 "context": "The following article called 'U.S. Stocks Retreat as Europe Overshadows Jobless Claims' was published on 2012-04-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nU.S. stocks fell, sending the\nStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index to its biggest weekly drop of the\nyear, as renewed concern about Europe\u2019s debt crisis overshadowed\na drop in jobless claims to a four-year low.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  fell more than 1.3\npercent for the biggest drops in the  Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage .  Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ)   lost 12 percent, the most in\nthe  S&P 500 , after the company forecast earnings that missed\nprojections.  Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  rose 2.2 percent as the price\nof oil climbed for the first time in three days.  Bed Bath &\nBeyond Inc. (BBBY)  added 8.5 percent, leading consumer discretionary\nstocks higher, as the retailer\u2019s profit beat estimates.  The S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent to 1,398.08 at 4 p.m. New\nYork time. The Dow fell 14.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to\n13,060.14. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. stock\nexchanges today, 15 percent below the three-month average.  \u201cYou have, certainly, improvement in the labor market in\nthe U.S. but every once in a while we got reminded there still\nremain problems in Europe,\u201d Greg Woodard, a portfolio\nstrategist at Manning & Napier in Fairport,  New York , which\nmanages about $40 billion, said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe\nvolatility is going to continue. It\u2019s going to be choppy. The\ntrend seems to be improvement in the U.S. and continued\ndifficulties outside the U.S.\u201d  The S&P 500  retreated  0.7 percent this week after reaching\nan almost four-year high on April 2, as demand fell at a Spanish\nbond auction and minutes from the  Federal Reserve \u2019s latest\npolicy meeting damped expectations for more monetary stimulus.\nThe gauge has still  rallied 11 percent  this year as U.S.\neconomic reports surpassed estimates and investors speculated\nthe euro-area\u2019s sovereign debt crisis will be contained.  Jobs Data  Equities trimmed early losses after Labor Department data\nshowed  unemployment claims  in the U.S. fell 6,000 to 357,000 in\nthe week ended March 31, the fewest since April 2008. The median\nforecast of 43 economists in a Bloomberg News survey estimated a\ndecrease to 355,000. The number of people on unemployment\nbenefit rolls also dropped, while those getting extended\npayments increased.  A report tomorrow may show the economy added more than\n200,000 jobs in March for a fourth consecutive month, the\nlongest streak of similar increases since late 1999 to early\n2000. While U.S. stock exchanges are closed tomorrow for Good\nFriday, index futures will trade for 45 minutes following the\nLabor Department\u2019s monthly jobs report.  Stocks fell earlier as Spanish bonds declined for a third\nday today, pushing the spread between yields on 10-year Spanish\nand German debt to more than 400 basis points for the first time\nsince Dec. 12.  \u2018Take Risk Off\u2019  The S&P 500 may fall as much as 7 percent because of\neconomic weakness in  Europe , according to hedge fund manager\n Barton Biggs .  \u201cI may want to take a little risk off,\u201d Biggs, founder of\nTraxis Partners LP, said on Bloomberg Television\u2019s \u201cIn the\nLoop\u201d with Betty Liu. \u201cI am cutting back a little, and I\u2019m\ntempted to cut back some more,\u201d he said. Equities are \u201cgoing\nhigher over the course of the next few months, but in the short\nrun here we\u2019ll have a little pause.\u201d  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index lost 0.4 percent. Alcoa\ndeclined 1.8 percent to $9.63, while General Electric erased 1.3\npercent to $19.49.  Constellation Brands plunged 12 percent to $21.61.
