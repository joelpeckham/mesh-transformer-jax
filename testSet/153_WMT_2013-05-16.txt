The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe U.S. health-care law\u2019s projected\ntax bite on businesses with more generous health benefits is\ndropping as medical spending slows and employers look to rein in\nthe cost of coverage.  The 2010 Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called Cadillac tax on\nhigh-premium health plans was initially projected to bring in\n$137 billion over the next decade. That estimate has now been\ntrimmed to about $80 billion, a $57 billion decrease, the\n Congressional Budget Office  said in a  report  this week.  The 2010 Affordable Care Act includes a 40 percent tax on\nemployee benefits exceeding $10,200 for individuals and $27,500\nfor families, on the theory that overly generous plans boost\nmedical costs. Companies have responded by pressing hospitals\nfor better rates, adding wellness programs and raising\ndeductibles on workers, said Steve Wojcik, a vice president at\nthe  National Business Group on Health .  \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any employer that\u2019s going to pay\nthe tax,\u201d said Wojcik, whose Washington-based trade group\nrepresents employers such as  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,  American\nExpress Co. (AXP)  and  Target Corp. (TGT)  \u201cI would be surprised if they even\ncollect\u201d the lower amount.  Largely because of a drop-off in projected tax revenues,\nthe estimated cost of implementing the law through 2023 rose by\n$40 billion to $1.36 trillion, the budget office said.  The law imposes the \u201ccadillac\u201d tax starting in 2018.\nSixty-one percent of employers with 500 workers or more said in\na 2011 survey that they expected to trigger the tax unless they\ntook steps, according to Mercer Inc., a Washington-based\nbenefits consultant.  New Projection  CBO analysts said in a May 14 blog  post  that the projection\nchanged because of \u201cnew data on the health insurance premiums\npaid by employers. As a result, we now expect fewer employment-based plans to be subject to the excise tax.\u201d  A slowdown in U.S. medical costs since the recession that\nbegan in 2008 probably contributed to the CBO\u2019s forecast, Wojcik\nsaid. Annual health spending climbed by about 3 percent on\naverage from 2009 to 2011, less than half the rate before the\nrecession started, according to the U.S. Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services.  Lower revenue from the tax would be \u201cgood news,\u201d showing\nthe U.S. is making strides against health-care costs that have\nlong outstripped the rest of the world, said  Jonathan Gruber , an\neconomist at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  in\nCambridge.  Breaking Point  The health law deserves credit, as do employers, Gruber\nsaid in a telephone interview. \u201cThey basically reached a\nbreaking point in terms of costs and are taking action.\u201d  Employers dispute the idea that their benefits have\nencouraged more spending, instead blaming \u201cunjustified cost\nincreases\u201d from doctors and hospitals, Wojcik said in a\ntelephone interview.  Nonetheless, the Cadillac tax has spurred efforts to trim\ninsurance costs, he said. In one example, Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, said last year\nthat it would pay for workers needing certain heart and spine\nsurgeries to travel to hospitals where the company says patient\noutcomes are better.  \u201cEmployers have really rallied around,\u201d said Beth Umland,\nMercer\u2019s director for health-care and benefits research. \u201cThey\nfeel like they pay enough for health care, they don\u2019t want to\npay a tax on top of that.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nAlex Nussbaum in  New York  at \n anussbaum1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nReg Gale at \n rgale5@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 65.77645874023438 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
