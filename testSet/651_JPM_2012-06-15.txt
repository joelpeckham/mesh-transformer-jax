 "context": "The following article called 'Florida Beats Texas as Homes Slim Penalty: Muni Credit' was published on 2012-06-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nFlorida \u2019s debt is starting to punch\nits weight in the $3.7 trillion municipal  bond market  as the\nstate\u2019s jobless rate has fallen more than in 42 counterparts in\nthe past two years.  The fourth-most populous state, one of only nine with a top\ngeneral-obligation grade from  Standard & Poor\u2019s , has seen the\n extra yield  on its bonds shrink by about 25 percent this year\nover the average AAA security, Bloomberg Fair Value data show.\nPeter DeGroot at JPMorgan Chase & Co. says the  yield spread  has\n\u201cfurther room to tighten\u201d amid declining unemployment and\nclimbing home sales.  \u201cThe market is realizing that the worst is over and that\nthey should be trading more like the  credit rating  that they\nhave,\u201d Justin Land, who helps manage $3 billion of munis at\nNaples, Florida-based Wasmer Schroeder & Co., said in an\ninterview. About 10 percent of their munis are from Florida.  Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes make it the biggest prize\namong states both presidential campaigns view as competitive in\nthe November election. It has a AAA rank from S&P and Moody\u2019s\nInvestors Service\u2019s second-highest grade of Aa1. Republican\nGovernor  Rick Scott , 59, has said protecting the bond rating is\na reason for lawmakers to cut spending.  The Sunshine State\u2019s jobless rate declined to 8.7 percent\nin April from an  11.4 percent  peak in January 2010. The drop\nties it with Illinois, Tennessee and  Indiana  for the fifth-\nbiggest improvement, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Florida\u2019s\nrate remains above the 8.2 percent national average.  JPMorgan\u2019s Assessment  After losses in 2008 and 2009 amid the worst recession\nsince the 1930s, Florida\u2019s economy grew in 2011 for the second\nstraight year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis. The 0.5 percent increase last year still ranked it\n37th among states.  At the same time, the average sales price on a single-\nfamily home in Florida this year is about $213,000 as of May 15,\nup 6.6 percent from the same period last year, Florida Realtors\ndata show.  Home prices  in Miami have risen for five straight\nmonths, according to the city\u2019s Association of Realtors.  \u201cGiven the significant improvements in housing and\nunemployment, we think there is room for Florida spreads to\ntighten,\u201d DeGroot, head of muni research at New York-based\nJPMorgan, wrote in a June 8 research report.  The fiscal 2012-2013 budget for the state of 18.8 million\npeople bridges a deficit in part by cutting spending 4 percent,\naccording to the report.  50 Percent  For 10-year general obligations of the state, the spread\nhas narrowed by about 50 percent since mid-2009 to about 0.35\npercentage point, DeGroot said in an e-mail.  When using a Bloomberg index that also includes the state\u2019s\nlocalities, investors demand about  0.56 percentage point  of\nextra yield for Florida debt over AAA securities nationwide,\ncompared with 0.77 points at the start of the year, data\ncompiled by Bloomberg show. The penalty has averaged 0.31 point\nin the past decade.  Investors are more comfortable with Florida and its\nmunicipalities than they were a year ago as the housing market\nhas bottomed out and the state has built up reserves, Daniel Solender, who helps manage $16 billion of munis, including\nFlorida debt, at Lord Abbett & Co., said in an interview from\n Jersey City ,  New Jersey .  \u201cFor a while there was concern whether it could get worse\nand now they seem to be stabilizing and they seem very well\nmanaged,\u201d Solender said.  Versus Texas  Florida debt has earned about 4 percent this year,\noutpacing 17 of 26 states tracked by S&P index data.  The state and its localities are also paying the least\nextra yield in four years compared with similarly rated Texas,\ndata compiled by Bloomberg show. An index of 10-year general-\nobligation debt of Florida bonds was  0.02 percentage point  above\nan index of debt of Texas issuers on June 11, the slimmest\ndifference since 2008.  Texas has a top rating from Moody\u2019s, and S&P\u2019s second-\nhighest rank, at AA+. The state\u2019s jobless rate fell to 6.9\npercent in April from a peak of 8.2 percent in 2009.  \u201cThere\u2019s more relative value in our mind for the generic\nFlorida credit relative to the generic  Texas  credit,\u201d Land\nsaid. \u201cThe rest of the market is probably coming to that\nconclusion as well.\u201d  Still, Florida\u2019s workforce is 750,000 smaller than its 2007\npeak and it is among five states where personal income remains\nbelow pre-recession levels, said  Amy Baker , top economist for\nthe state Office of Economic and Demographic Research.  Population Estimate  \u201cWe made a little headway,\u201d she said in a presentation\nthis week in Tallahassee, the capital. The recession \u201cwas a\nlittle bit deeper, a little bit longer, a little bit tougher on\nFlorida\u201d than state economists originally estimated, she said.  Baker projected Florida will surpass New York as the third-\nbiggest state in 2016 and grow by 5.1 million people by 2030.  \u201cPopulation continues to be Florida\u2019s primary engine of\neconomic growth,\u201d she said.  Mayors in Jacksonville,  West Palm Beach  and Tampa said at a\nconference of the nation\u2019s mayors this week in  Orlando  that they\nsee signs of recovery though they expect to make additional\nbudget cuts this year. West Palm Beach fees for new construction\nmay reach a six-year high, Mayor Jeri Muoio said in an\ninterview.  \u201cThe buzz is good,\u201d she said.  Following are pending sales:  NEW YORK  CITY MUNICIPAL WATER FINANCE AUTHORITY is set to\nborrow $450 million of revenue bonds as soon as next week,\naccording to bond documents. (Added June 15)  LOUISIANA plans to sell about $581 million in general-\nobligation bonds as soon as next week, according to an offering\ndocument. About $144 million will be taxable debt, with the rest\ntax-free. The proceeds will be used for refunding. Moody\u2019s rates\nthe debt Aa2, third-highest.
