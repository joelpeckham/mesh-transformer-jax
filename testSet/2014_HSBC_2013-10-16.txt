The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAbengoa SA (ABG) , a bioethanol producer\nwith plants in the U.S. and  Europe , is selling  shares  at 1.80\neuros to 1.90 euros each as it seeks to cut debt, people\nfamiliar with the matter said.  The company is offering  Class B stock  in the form of shares\nor American Depositary Shares, to be listed in Spain and  New\nYork . The deal will price after the close of trading today and\nthe offering has received enough applications in that range to\nfill the order book, according to two people, who asked not to\nbe named as details aren\u2019t public.  A pricing of 1.80 euros per B share would be an 18 percent\ndiscount to yesterday\u2019s close. The stock fell 5.9 percent to\n2.06 euros at 1:02 p.m. in Madrid today.  Abengoa filed to offer as many as 182.5 million Class B\nshares, which typically have different  voting rights  to their\nClass A counterparts, on Oct. 4. If the Seville, Spain-based\ncompany sells that many shares at the mid-point of the range, it\nwould raise about 338 million euros ($458 million).  Abengoa, which disclosed this month that it was being\ninvestigated as part of a European Union antitrust probe into\npossible manipulation of oil and biofuel prices, said it will\nuse the proceeds to repay debt and strengthen its balance sheet.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and HSBC Holdings Plc are managing the sale,\nalong with Bank of America Corp., Banco Santander SA, Canaccord\nGenuity Group Inc. and Societe Generale SA.  The volume of additional share sales in Europe, the  Middle\nEast  and Africa has risen to approximately $82 billion this\nyear, nearly double what issuers raised in the same period in\n2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
