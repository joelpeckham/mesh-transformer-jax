The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nChrysler Group LLC, the automaker\ncontrolled by  Fiat SpA (F) , is in exclusive talks with  Banco\nSantander SA (SAN)  to make its U.S. unit the automaker\u2019s preferred\nfinancing provider, people familiar with the matter said.  Chrysler entered a 30-day negotiating period with the\nlender, which would be the U.S. automaker\u2019s main partner for\nfinancing with customers and dealers, said the people, who\ndeclined to be identified because the negotiations are private.  Sergio Marchionne , the chief executive officer of Chrysler\nand Fiat, said at the Paris Motor Show in September that\nSantander Holdings USA and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  were\n\u201cpossible\u201d financing partners for Chrysler. The Auburn Hills,\nMichigan-based automaker said in April that it would let its\npreferred-lender agreement with  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)  expire in\nApril 2013.  \u201cYou need to know that your lender of choice is going to\nbe available and willing to make the loans necessary to move\nproduct,\u201d Alec Gutierrez, an analyst for researcher Kelley Blue\nBook, said yesterday in a telephone interview. \u201cThe question\nwill be, is this lender still going to be willing to carry over\na lot of the aggressive programs that Ally was running?\u201d  The pact with Detroit-based Ally requires Chrysler to allow\nAlly to finance a minimum percentage of vehicles sold with\nsubvented loans, which are those made to consumers at below-\nmarket rates. Automakers pay lenders to make up the difference.  Ally Offers  The expiring accord with Ally doesn\u2019t cover other business\nthat the lender does with Chrysler dealers, such as wholesale\nfinancing, so-called standard-rate financing for consumers, or\nleasing.  Ally has been offering zero-percent financing and\ncompetitive lease deals this year on vehicles such as the\nChrysler 200 midsize sedan, said Gutierrez, who is based in\n Irvine ,  California .  \u201cThat midsize segment has become just absolutely flooded\nwith great offers on brand new and redesigned product,\u201d he said\nyesterday. \u201cSome of those lease offers out there are really\npretty killer, and you have to assume that they\u2019re moving quite\na bit of volume in that segment with those offers.\u201d  Laurie Kight, a U.S. spokeswoman for Santander, Spain\u2019s\nbiggest bank, didn\u2019t respond to messages left by telephone or e-\nmail. The company\u2019s U.S. operations are based in  Fort Worth ,\nTexas.  Chrysler, the No. 3 U.S. automaker behind  General Motors\nCo. (GM)  and Ford Motor Co., generates more than $25 billion in auto\nloans annually, people familiar with the matter said in\nFebruary.
