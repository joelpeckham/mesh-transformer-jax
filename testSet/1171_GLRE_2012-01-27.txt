The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nEmployees at  Greenlight Capital Inc. (GLRE) \nand  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) \u2019s Cazenove unit were fined in a second\nwave of U.K. sanctions over Greenlight\u2019s sale of  Punch Taverns\nPlc (PUB)  shares in 2009.  Alexander Ten-Holter, the hedge fund\u2019s former compliance\nofficer, was fined 130,000 pounds ($204,000) for failing to\n\u201cmake reasonable enquiries\u201d before selling the firm\u2019s holding,\nthe  Financial Services Authority  said in a statement today.\nCaspar Agnew, a Cazenove trader, was fined 65,000 pounds for\nfailing to identify and report a \u201csuspicious order.\u201d  Greenlight Capital and its chairman,  David Einhorn , were\nalready fined 7.2 million pounds by the U.K.\u2019s FSA, which\nincluded the regulator\u2019s second-largest fine for an individual.\nAndrew Osborne, a former corporate broker at  Bank of America\nCorp .\u2019s Merrill Lynch, also faces a fine of 350,000 pounds in\nthe investigation, a person with knowledge of the matter said\nyesterday.  \u201cTen-Holter\u2019s approach to compliance oversight was wholly\ninadequate,\u201d Tracey McDermott, the FSA\u2019s acting director of\nenforcement and financial crime, said in an e-mailed statement.\n\u201cSerious compliance failures of this nature can have a dramatic\neffect on the orderliness and integrity of the markets.\u201d  Full Support  Greenlight said that Ten-Holter continues to have the hedge\nfund\u2019s full support.  \u201cAlex is a valued member of the Greenlight team and our\ntrader in the U.K.,\u201d Greenlight said in an e-mailed statement.\n\u201cWe believe that the FSA\u2019s action against him is unwarranted.\u201d  Agnew didn\u2019t \u201cact with due skill, care and diligence,\u201d in\nfailing to report the trade as suspicious, the FSA said. He\n\u201cthought that Greenlight was simply fortunate in the timing of\nits transactions.\u201d The regulator said that his \u201cintegrity is\nnot questioned in any way.\u201d  Kate Haywood , a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in  London ,\ndeclined to comment today. Agnew and Ten-Holter didn\u2019t respond\nto e-mail messages seeking comment. A number for Osborne\ncouldn\u2019t be located and Bank of America declined to comment or\nprovide contact details for him yesterday.  Einhorn, Greenlight\u2019s 43-year-old chairman, was told of\nPunch Taverns\u2019s plan to sell equity by a broker representing the\ncompany, the  FSA  said in an e-mailed statement on Jan. 25. He\nthen sold more than 11 million Punch Tavern shares over the\nfollowing four days, avoiding losses of about 5.8 million pounds\nfor the fund, the regulator said.  \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in 2009, and I don\u2019t believe now, that\nthere was anything wrong with our conduct,\u201d Einhorn said after\nthe FSA fine.  Greenlight, wholly owned by Einhorn, had around 31\nemployees in 2009, according to the FSA. The $7.8 billion\nGreenlight Capital LP fund returned 2.9 percent last year and\nhas produced annualized returned of 20 percent since the fund\nstarted in May 1996, according to a letter sent to investors.
