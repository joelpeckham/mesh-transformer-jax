 "context": "The following article called 'Shutdown Could Reduce U.S. Growth By 0.2 Point This Week' was published on 2013-10-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA partial federal government\nshutdown lasting through the end of this week would pare 0.2\npercentage point from U.S. economic growth and cost as much as\n0.5 point if it continues another two weeks, according to the\nmedian estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Estimates of gross domestic product losses in the fourth\nquarter if the shutdown ends this week range from zero to 0.6 on\nan annualized basis, according to a Bloomberg survey of 45\neconomists taken Oct. 4-9. The U.S. government began its first\npartial shutdown in 17 years Oct. 1 as Republicans and Democrats\nclashed over passing a budget.  \u201cThe main impact on GDP comes from the government sector\nitself,\u201d said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Pierpont\nSecurities LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . \u201cMy guess is the\nripple effects are modest early on, but if the government were\nto stay shut down for as long as a month, you would see issues\ndeveloping in the private sector.\u201d  Companies reliant on federal procurement spending, such as\n Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the top federal contractor, have already\nfurloughed workers because of the shutdown. Having initially\nplanned to send 3,000 people home, the company reduced the\nnumber by about 20 percent Oct. 7 after the Defense Department\nsaid most of its idled employees would be called back to work.  For many furloughed federal employees, the paychecks they\nreceive tomorrow may be half their usual amount, and the last\nones for a while.  Diminishing Impact  The effects of a shutdown could diminish with time as\nAmericans pressure the government into recalling more workers,\nsaid Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics LLC in\nBoulder,  Colorado .  \u201cAs we keep passing patches, the size becomes smaller and\nsmaller, and the effects diminish,\u201d Englund said.  Even so, the cumulative effect would continue to build the\nlonger the shutdown continues, according to projections in the\nBloomberg survey.  Economists expected a 0.1 percentage point cost after one\nweek of shutdown, based on an Oct. 1 Bloomberg survey. The\nmedian estimate of GDP loss from a shutdown lasting through Oct.\n18 was a 0.3 percentage point reduction, this week\u2019s poll shows,\nclimbing to half a point if the shutdown persists through the\nend of the following week.  The median estimate of 68 economists in a separate survey\nforecast annualized growth at a 2.4 percent rate in the fourth\nquarter. The September survey was for 2.5 percent.  Reduced Growth  \u201cRight now, we\u2019re looking at another quarter of below-potential growth,\u201d said  Stefane Marion , chief economist and\nstrategist at  National Bank of Canada (NA)  Financial Inc. in\n Montreal . Reduced growth \u201cmakes the difference between\nstabilizing the unemployment rate or having a rate that might\ndrift higher.\u201d  Economists also cut their forecasts for the third quarter\nand the first quarter of 2014. The median for the third quarter\nwas lowered to 1.9 percent from 2 percent in the September\nsurvey, and the median for the first three months of 2014 was\ndown to 2.6 percent from 2.7 percent.  Initial  jobless claims  climbed to 374,000 last week from\n308,000 the prior week, Labor Department data showed today. The\nsurge was the most since in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in\nNovember 2012.  The jump came as  California  worked through a claims backlog\ncaused by a computer system switch and as non-federal employees\nwere forced to take time off because the shutdown, a Labor\nDepartment spokesman said.  Federal Reserve  Federal Reserve  policy makers said after their Sept. 17-18\nmeeting that they will wait to taper $85 billion in monthly\nasset purchases until they see more evidence of steady growth to\nreduce the 7.3 percent  unemployment rate . Minutes from the\nmeeting, released this week, show Fed officials who favored\nmaintaining the pace of purchases cited concerns partly from\n\u201cconsiderable risks surrounding fiscal policy.\u201d  \u201cTheir concerns about a new fiscal shock have materialized\nand this will probably delay the start of tapering further\ninto\u201d the first quarter, Societe Generale SA economists led by\nMichel Martinez and Michala Marcussen, wrote in a note to\nclients today.  Another fiscal battle is playing out: the  U.S. Treasury  has\nsaid its ability to borrow will end on about Oct. 17 unless\nCongress increases the $16.7 trillion debt  ceiling . Treasury\nSecretary Jacob J. Lew told Congress today that failing to raise\nthe limit would risk putting the U.S. into default and cause\n\u201cirrevocable damage\u201d to the economy and financial markets.  Fiscal Talks  President  Barack Obama  said this week that he would accept\na short-term debt limit increase and an agreement to end the\npartial government shutdown and then enter broader fiscal\nnegotiations with Republicans.  \u201cFailing to raise the debt ceiling will impact everyday\nAmericans beyond its impact on financial markets,\u201d Lew told the\nSenate Finance Committee today. Between Oct. 17 and Nov. 1, the\nU.S. has \u201clarge payments to Medicare providers, Social Security\nbeneficiaries, and veterans, as well as salaries for active-duty\nmembers of the military. A failure to raise the debt limit could\nput timely payment of all of these at risk.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nJeanna Smialek in Washington at \n jsmialek1@bloomberg.net ;\nCatarina Saraiva in Washington at \n asaraiva5@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nChris Wellisz at \n cwellisz@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Lockheed Martin Corporation was 96.87409210205078 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Lockheed Martin Corporation was ",
