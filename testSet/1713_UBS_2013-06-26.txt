The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nTaiwan lawmakers voted to roll back\nprovisions of a capital gains tax on certain stock sales and\nremoved an index price threshold that depressed shares and\ndragged down market trading volume.  The tax on capital gains from transactions of more than\nNT$1 billion was reduced to 0.1 percent from 2.25 percent under\nthe original law. Lawmakers also removed a 8,500-point close\nthreshold for the  Taiex index  before the tax could go into\neffect. Legislative  Yuan  President Wang Jin-pyng announced the\npassage of revisions in a special legislative session yesterday.\nThe benchmark Taiex index rose 1.6 percent to 7,784.80 at the\nclose. the biggest advance since April 19.  The new rules come after stock-trading volume declined by\nas much as 30 percent in the first four months of the year,\naccording to Credit Suisse Group AG. President Ma Ying-jeou\u2019s\nadministration and legislators argued over about 10 versions of\nthe tax last year, prompting then-Finance Minister Christina Liu\nto step down. The Taiex lost 13 percent during the period.  \u201cThis would create motivation for local investors to enter\nthe market, since the capital gains tax was always seen as a\nnegative for stocks,\u201d said Parker Wu, a fund manager at the\nAgriculture Bank of  Taiwan , who helps oversee the equivalent of\n$98 million.  Taiwanese residents invested more capital overseas in the\nlast two quarters of 2012 compared with the previous period,\nCredit Suisse analyst Christiaan Tuntono wrote in a May 20\nreport, citing the island\u2019s central bank. The government\u2019s\ntransaction tax revenue fell by 24 percent in the first four\nmonths of the year, according to Tuntono.  Past Attempt   Before passing the levy last year, Taiwan had exempted\nsecurities transactions from capital-gains taxes since 1990,\naccording to the stock exchange\u2019s website. Stocks fell for 19\nconsecutive days, tumbling 33 percent in a month, when the plan\nfor the tax was first discussed in 1988, Schive Chi said last\nyear when he was the chairman of Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp.  The Taiex index  retreated  0.5 percent this year through\nyesterday, erasing gains on concern the Federal Reserve will\nscale back monetary stimulus as the economy recovers. The\nbenchmark index trades at 13.4 times 12-month projected profit,\nthe lowest since June last year, compared with the MSCI Emerging\nMarket index\u2019s 9.4 times, according to data compiled by\nBloomberg.  The revisions may not be sufficient to serve as a catalyst\nfor the market with the focus on liquidity and and the timing of\nthe Fed\u2019s scaledown of quantitative easing, UBS AG said in a\nreport dated today.
