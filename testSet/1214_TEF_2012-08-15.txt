 "context": "The following article called 'Brazil Mobile Carriers Face Removal of Dropped-Call Fees' was published on 2012-08-15. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBrazilian wireless carriers may lose\nrevenue under a government proposal designed to cut down on fees\nby increasing the time users can restart dropped calls without\nincurring an extra charge.  Under the plan approved yesterday by telecommunications\nagency Anatel, a user who experiences a dropped call would be\nable to reconnect within two minutes without being charged for a\nnew call. Current rules stipulate a time limit of 30 seconds for\nrestarting a call at no extra charge.  Brazilian carriers offer some wireless plans that charge by\nthe phone call instead of by the minute. Should the proposal be\nadopted it would cut into the revenue of Telefonica Brasil SA,\n Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) ,  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  and  Oi SA (OIBR4) , the nation\u2019s\nlargest wireless carriers. The plan now faces a public\nconsultation, Anatel Superintendent Bruno Ramos said yesterday.  \u201cIf the call drops, no matter what the user\u2019s plan of\n service , it will have to be charged only as a single call,\u201d\nRamos said in an interview in Brasilia. \u201cThe measure provides\nan enormous benefit for users on plans that charge per call.\u201d  Anatel allowed Tim, America Movil and Oi to restart sales\nof new plans on Aug. 3 after they said they would improve their\nnetworks. The agency suspended sales in some states for 11 days,\nciting complaints about service including dropped calls.  Anatel reached its decision on removing dropped-call\ncharges after the close of trading yesterday.  Telefonica Brasil, a unit of Madrid-based  Telefonica SA (TEF) ,\nfell 0.7 percent to 49.51 reais in Sao Paulo yesterday. Tim, a\ndivision of  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , gained 0.9 percent to 8.61\nreais. Rio de Janeiro-based Oi slid 2.2 percent to 8.90 reais.\nAmerica Movil gained 1.5 percent to 17.08 pesos in Mexico City,\nwhere it is based.
