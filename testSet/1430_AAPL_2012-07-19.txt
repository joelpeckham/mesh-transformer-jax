The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nApple Inc., the maker of the iPad and\niPhone, received a patent on the graphic user interface it uses\nin its portable devices.  The patent is one that \u201csmartphone copycats should fear,\u201d\n according to  Wired magazine. The Android Authority website,\nwhich covers telephones using  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s Android operating\nsystem,  said  the patent is a major \u201cpotential weapon against\nAndroid.\u201d  Patent 8,223,134, which was issued July 17, covers the\n\u201cportable electronic device, method, and graphical user\ninterface for displaying electronic lists and documents.\u201d  Apple says in the patent that as portable electronic\ndevices became capable of more and more functions, it becomes\nincreasingly difficult for users to keep track of the key\nsequences and menu hierarchies used to access, store and\nmanipulate data.  The patented technology makes use of graphic interfaces\nthat can be manipulated through a touch screen. The interfaces\nare aimed at increasing \u201cthe effectiveness, efficiency and user\nsatisfaction with portable multifunction devices,\u201d according to\nthe patent.  Cupertino, California-based Apple applied for the patent in\nMarch 2012, with the assistance of Philadelphia\u2019s Morgan Lewis &\nBockius LLP.  Geron Says Patent Office Rejected Challenge to ViaCyte Patent  Geron Corp. (GERN) , the biotech company that last year abandoned\nits stem-cell clinical trials, said the U.S. Patent and\n Trademark Office  turned away its challenge to a stem cell-\nrelated patent held by ViaCyte Inc., a San Diego-based\ncompetitor.  According to a Geron regulatory filing, the patent office\u2019s\nBoard of Patent appeals and Interferences rejected arguments\nagainst claims in ViaCyte\u2019s patent 7,510,876. The board also\nsaid that some of the claims in a Geron patent application were\nunpatentable.  The technology covered by the disputed application is part\nof its stem cell  intellectual property  portfolio the Menlo Park,\nCalifornia-based company is seeking to divest, Geron said.  In November 2011 Geron said in a  statement  that it would\ndiscontinue its clinical trials of its stem cell-related\ntherapies to focus on oncology drugs.  Geron is the company that funded the  University of\nWisconsin  research that first isolated stem cells from human\nembryos in 1998.  In July 2011 the company said it had won clearance from the\nU.S.  Food and Drug Administration  to test a therapy derived from\nthose cells. Geron ended those trials because of research costs\nand regulatory complexities.  Rovi Says Patent Licensing Delays Prompt Lower Annual Forecast  Rovi Corp. (ROVI) , a provider of digital entertainment guides,\nsaid it missed out on key patent licenses.  \u201cIn order to ensure the long-term protection of our key\nintellectual property, we did not sign certain new patent\nlicensing agreements during the second quarter, as some expected\nlicensees would not agree to acceptable terms,\u201d Tom Carson,\nchief executive officer of the Santa Clara, California-based\ncompany, said in a statement July 17. \u201cIn addition, certain\nother deals with first time licensees are simply taking longer\nto close than anticipated.\u201d  Rovi sued three television makers in May, claiming\ninfringement of patents for its technology and parental-control\nchips that block television content.  That month the company\nalso filed two other patent cases against Hulu LLC, the online\nvideo service, and Roku Inc., a developer of home entertainment\nelectronics.  The patent cases against the television manufacturers are\npresently on hold pending the outcome of a complaint Rovi filed\nwith the U.S. International Trade Commission. The Washington-\nbased commission has the power to bar importation of products\nthat infringe U.S. patents.  Novartis Sues Sun Pharma Over Patent for Bone-Strengthening Drug  Novartis AG (NOVN)  filed a patent suit in federal court in  New\nJersey  following  Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Inc. (SUNP) \u2019s\napplication with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell a\ngeneric form of the bone-strengthening drug Zometa. Such suits\nare frequently filed whenever an application is made to sell a\ngeneric form of a patented drug.  Sun, based in Mumbai, is accused of infringing patent\n7,932,241, which was issued in April 2011. Novartis seeks a\ncourt order barring Sun from making, importing or selling a\nproduct that infringed the patent.  Zometa, a bisphosphonate drug, is used to treat\nosteoporosis and bone diseases in cancer patients.

Trademark  British Shoe Fans Creating Faux Louboutins With Red Paint  British fashionistas with yearnings bigger than their\npocketbooks aren\u2019t letting the trademark battle between\nChristian Louboutin and Yves St. Laurent SAS/France get in the\nway of their desire for chic shoes, the U.K.\u2019s Telegraph\nnewspaper  reported .  Pricey Louboutin shoes are known for their distinctive red\nsoles, which are also the subject of the trademark dispute with\nYves St. Laurent, according to the Telegraph.  Women who can\u2019t afford the shoes are buying small sample\nbottles of red paint and using it to transform their less-\nexpensive shoes into faux red-soled Louboutins, the Telegraph\nreported.  U.K.-based  Home Retail Group (HOME) \u2019s Homebase unit told the\nTelegraph that sales of sample size paint in several bright red\ncolors have risen 40 percent in the past year, with many\ncustomers saying they intend to use in on their shoe soles.  Apple Must Publish Notice Samsung Didn\u2019t Copy IPad in U.K.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  was ordered by a judge to publish a notice on\nits U.K. website and in British newspapers alerting people to a\nruling that Samsung Electronics Co. didn\u2019t copy designs for the\niPad.  The notice should outline the July 9 London court decision\nthat Samsung\u2019s Galaxy tablets don\u2019t infringe Apple\u2019s registered\ndesigns, Judge Colin Birss said yesterday. It should be posted\non Apple\u2019s U.K. home page for six months and published in\nseveral newspapers and magazines to correct any impression the\nSouth Korea-based company was copying Apple\u2019s product, Birss\nsaid.  The order means Apple will have to publish \u201can\nadvertisement\u201d for Samsung, Richard Hacon, a lawyer for\nCupertino, California-based Apple, told the court. \u201cNo company\nlikes to refer to a rival on its website.\u201d  Apple is fighting patent lawsuits around the globe against\ncompetitors including Google Inc.,  HTC Corp. (2498)  and Samsung as it\ncompetes for dominance of the smartphone and tablet computer\nmarkets. The firms have accused each other of copying designs\nand technology in their mobile devices. Legal battles about the\nsimilarity of Samsung and Apple tablets are being fought in\nGermany, the Netherlands and the U.S.  Birss said in his July 9 ruling that Samsung\u2019s tablets were\nunlikely to be confused with the iPad because they are \u201cnot as\ncool.\u201d He declined yesterday to grant Samsung\u2019s bid for an\ninjunction blocking Apple from making public statements that the\nGalaxy infringed its design rights.  \u201cThey are entitled to their opinion,\u201d he said.  Apple spokesman Alan Hely didn\u2019t immediately respond to a\nphone call and e-mail requesting comment on the judge\u2019s order.  \u201cShould Apple continue to make excessive legal claims\nbased on such generic designs, innovation in the industry could\nbe harmed and consumer choice unduly limited,\u201d Samsung said in\na statement after the hearing.  \u201cThe war between these two companies seems to be  Comments made by Apple after that ruling unfairly implied\nthat Samsung had copied designs, Samsung\u2019s lawyer Kathryn\nPickard said at the hearing. That \u201ccaused real commercial\nharm.\u201d  As well as Apple\u2019s website, the company must pay for\nnotices in the Financial Times, the  Daily Mail , Guardian Mobile\nmagazine, and T3, according to a draft copy of the order\nprovided by Samsung\u2019s lawyers.  Apple\u2019s lawyer said the company would appeal the July 9\ndecision and Judge Birss granted the company permission to take\nits case to the court of appeal.  The case is Samsung Electronics (UK) Ltd. & Anr v. Apple\nInc.,  High Court  of Justice,  Chancery Division , HC11C03050.  For more trademark news, click here.
