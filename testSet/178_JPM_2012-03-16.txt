 "context": "The following article called 'Foreclosure Whistleblower Wins $18 Million in Bank Accord' was published on 2012-03-16. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nAttorney  Lynn Szymoniak  had spent a\ncareer investigating insurance fraud when a bank moved to\nforeclose on her  Florida  home in 2008. Almost four years later,\nthe fraud she said she uncovered by combing through mortgage\ndocuments earned her $18 million.  Szymoniak, 63, is among six whistle-blowers who will pocket\n$46.5 million as part of a $25 billion national foreclosure\nsettlement that state and federal officials reached in February\nwith five banks, including  Bank of America Corp . and  JPMorgan\nChase & Co. (JPM) , according to the U.S. Justice Department.  \u201cWhen they did this to her, they picked the wrong person\nat the wrong time in the wrong place,\u201d Richard Harpootlian,\nSzymoniak\u2019s attorney in two whistle-blower cases, said in an\ninterview. \u201cThey stuck their hand into the beehive.\u201d  Szymoniak\u2019s examination, in which she relied on her\nexperience as an insurance-fraud investigator, led to her claims\nagainst banks for submitting fraudulent documents to the federal\ngovernment asserting that they owned loans insured by the\n Federal Housing Administration , she said.  The national foreclosure settlement with the five banks,\nwhich resolves claims of abusive foreclosure practices, provides\nmortgage relief to borrowers, pays $1.5 billion to those who\nlost their homes to foreclosure, and sets standards for how the\nbanks service mortgage loans.  Whistle-Blowers\u2019 Share  As part of the agreement, whistle-blower claims are being\nsettled for about $228 million, according to court papers filed\nin federal court in  Washington . A group of six whistle-blowers\nwill receive $46.5 million out of that amount, said  Alisa\nFinelli , a Justice Department spokeswoman.  Szymoniak\u2019s foreclosure case began in July 2008 when\n Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , as trustee for a mortgage securitization\ntrust, sued to seize her  Palm Beach Gardens , Florida, home,\nwhich was once worth $1.3 million. The bank couldn\u2019t prove it\nowned her loan and claimed it had lost the mortgage note, she\nsaid.  John Gallagher , a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche\nBank, declined to comment on Szymoniak\u2019s foreclosure case.  Like many homeowners, Szymoniak said she was surprised by\nthe subprime mortgage crisis and its effect on the U.S. real-\nestate market. She stopped making mortgage payments in 2008\nafter a battle with cancer wiped out her savings and she cut\nback on work to care for her mother, who was sick, she said in\nan interview.  \u2018Pretty Obvious\u2019  Szymoniak said she was first alerted to problems in the\npaperwork on her foreclosure when Deutsche Bank said it acquired\nher mortgage note in October 2008, three months after the bank\nsued her over the loan.  \u201cSo I began doing what I\u2019ve done for years -- go out and\ninvestigate,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was pretty obvious to me that the\npaperwork was fraudulent.\u201d  Her work quickly uncovered widespread document fraud in the\nmortgage industry, she said, and eventually led to the filing of\nher whistle-blower cases in 2010.  The whistle-blower claims resolved in the national\nsettlement include a case filed in Atlanta in 2006 in which\nbanks are accused of defrauding military veterans and the U.S.\ngovernment.  Veterans\u2019 Refinancing  The banks violated rules under a Department of Veterans\nAffairs program for refinancing  mortgage loans  by charging\nimproper fees to veterans, according to the complaint. The banks\nhid those fees and obtained government guarantees on the loans,\naccording to the complaint.  The two whistle-blowers, Victor Bibby and Brian Donnelly,\nwill split $11.7 million out of the $45 million JPMorgan agreed\nto pay to settle the veterans case, said  Brandon Peak , a lawyer\nworking on the case. Claims against other banks in the case are\npending.  The settlement underscores the benefits provided to\ntaxpayers from whistle-blowers and the incentives for those who\nexpose fraud through so-called qui tam cases, Peak said.  \u201cThis is what qui tam actions are for -- to incentivize\npeople to come forward and expose fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cThe\ntaxpayers actually receive this money back that they never would\nhave received absent these whistle-blowers.\u201d  Robo-Signed Documents  Szymoniak said her review of mortgage documents uncovered\nthe practice known as robo-signing, in which bank officials and\ncontractors signed documents without verifying the information.\nTens of thousands of documents were affected, and the same\npeople also used various job titles on the forms, she said.  Szymoniak was the first whistleblower to find reams of\ndocuments signed by Linda Green, an employee of a mortgage-\nprocessing company, that contained questionable signatures,\nHarpootlian said.  \u201cThese documents were clearly signed by different people\nin different places, with different signatures, on the same\ndates,\u201d Harpootlian said.  It took her \u201cless than five days\u201d to figure out that the\npractices were widespread, Szymoniak added.  Szymoniak decided to approach law-enforcement officials\nwith her suspicions that taxpayers may have been defrauded as\nthe fraudulent documents were submitted to the U.S. Department\nof Housing and Urban Development by banks seeking to collect on\ngovernment-insured loans, she said.  AIG Lawsuit  Her discoveries also prompted her to hire Harpootlian, who\nhad retained Szymoniak in the past as an expert witness in a\nlawsuit against the insurer American International Group Inc.,\nto file her whistle-blower claims.  Szymoniak was also represented by  Ken Suggs , another South\nCarolina-based plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer and  Reuben Guttman , a\nWashington-based attorney who specializes in whistle-blower\nlitigation.  Most whistle-blower cases are brought by company insiders\nwho uncover wrongdoing within their own corporations or a\ncompetitor\u2019s, said  Joel Hesch , a former Justice Department\nlawyer who is now a professor at Liberty University Law School\nin  Virginia . A person doesn\u2019t have to be an insider to file a\nfalse-claims case, said Hesch, who spent 16 years litigating\nwhistle-blower cases on behalf of the government.  The government turns down about 80 percent of whistle-\nblower cases it reviews as a required step in the litigation,\nHesch said. If the government rejects the case, plaintiffs are\nfree to press their claims on their own.  Prepared to Sue  Szymoniak said she was prepared to do just that if the\ngovernment failed to join her suit over mortgage-foreclosure\npractices.  Thomas Kelly , a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,\ndeclined to comment on the whistle-blower cases resolved as part\nthe national foreclosure settlement.  Shirley Norton , a\nspokeswoman for  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America,\ndidn\u2019t return an e-mail seeking comment.  The three other lenders that agreed to the national\nsettlement were Detroit-based  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , San\nFrancisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  Gina Proia,\nan Ally Financial spokeswoman, declined to comment. Wells Fargo\nspokeswoman Vickee Adams didn\u2019t return an e-mail seeking\ncomment.  Mark Rodgers , a Citigroup spokesman, also declined to\ncomment on the claims. The New York-based bank has added\nresources to ensure foreclosures are processed correctly, he\nsaid in an e-mailed statement.  \u201cThe changes and safeguards implemented give Citigroup\nconfidence that there are no systemic issues in its existing\nforeclosure processes,\u201d he said.  Szymoniak said she\u2019s unsure what she\u2019ll do with the $18\nmillion award. Deutsche Bank is proceeding with its foreclosure\naction against her home, she said.  \u201cEven if I pay off the mortgage, I would own a house with\nno clear title, so I still couldn\u2019t sell it,\u201d she said.  The national foreclosure settlement case is U.S. v.  Bank of\nAmerica Corp. (BAC) , 12-00361, U.S. District Court,  District of\nColumbia  (Washington).
