 "context": "The following article called 'Argentina Won\u2019t Repeat 2001 Crisis, Top Fernandez Aide Says' was published on 2012-06-01. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nA top aide to Argentine President\n Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said the country isn\u2019t heading\nfor a repeat of its 2001 financial crisis and that there are no\nplans to turn dollar-denominated contracts and loans into pesos.  \u201cThis isn\u2019t 2001, which was fueled by banks and the\nmedia,\u201d Deputy Economy Minister Axel Kicillof, the mastermind\nof Fernandez\u2019s seizure in April of Spanish-owned oil producer\n YPF SA (YPFD) , told reporters in Buenos Aires today. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going\nto happen.\u201d  Kicillof, 40, was commenting on a report in today\u2019s\nCronista newspaper that the government was planning to\n\u201cpesify\u201d the economy by converting existing dollar-denominated\nloans and contracts into the national currency. There are no\nplans to introduce multiple exchange rates, he said.  South America \u2019s second-biggest  economy  defaulted on $95\nbillion in bonds in late 2001 and shortly after abandoned a\ndecade-old currency peg that fixed the peso at one per dollar.\nThe peso lost as much as 75 percent of its value the following\nyear, while the government forced banks to convert dollar\ndeposits and loans into pesos.  Since her re-election in October, Fernandez tightened\ncontrols on the foreign exchange market and forced companies to\nrepatriate money held abroad in a bid to stem capital outflows\nand preserve central bank  reserves , which she uses to pay debt\nwith the government shut out of foreign credit markets.  Dearth of Dollars  The restrictions, which include the need for the tax agency\nto approve all purchases of foreign currencies, have led to a\nwidening gap between the official and unregulated peso exchange\nrates. After rising 35 percent this year, the dollar in the\nunregulated market now costs 6.34 pesos, a record 42 percent\nmore than the official rate of 4.47 pesos.  Difficulties in buying dollars have led Argentines to bring\ncourt cases against the government, saying the tax agency\ndoesn\u2019t have the authority to forbid currency purchases. One\nplaintiff was a 59-year-old grandfather who was refused\npermission to buy $10 that he planned to give to his two\ngrandsons.  Cabinet Chief Juan Manuel Abal Medina on May 30 told\nCongress that Argentines are \u201cobsessed\u201d with dollars and that\nthe government is seeking to \u201cde-dollarize\u201d the economy.  \u201cIt\u2019s a cultural problem,\u201d Abal Medina said. \u201cIt\u2019s very\nimportant that Argentines be more normal and use dollars only\nfor the trade exchange as happens in other places.\u201d  The president herself is among those who prefer dollars. At\nLos Sauces Casa Patagonica hotel, which Fernandez owns in the\nsouthern Patagonian region where she used to live, rates are\nquoted in dollars, according to its  website . The hotel offers a\nthree-night honeymoon package at $1,100 plus tax.  Yesterday Senator Anibal Fernandez, a former cabinet chief,\nsaid that he owns $24,000 and bought them \u201cbecause I felt like\nit.\u201d  Speaking to Radio Continental, he said Argentines are free\nto buy dollars \u201cif they can.\u201d  To contact the reporter on this story:\nEliana Raszewski in  Buenos Aires  at \n eraszewski@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\n Joshua Goodman  at \n jgoodman19@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of YPF Sociedad Anonima was 12.022509574890137 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of YPF Sociedad Anonima was ",
