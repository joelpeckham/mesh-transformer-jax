 "context": "The following article called 'Lufthansa in Talks to Sell Bmibaby Unit to Intro of Germany' was published on 2012-01-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nDeutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  is in talks to\nsell the discount division of its British BMI subsidiary to\nGerman turnaround specialist  Intro Aviation GmbH , Intro Chief\nExecutive Officer  Peter Oncken  said in an interview.  \u201cWe have expressed our interest and the whole procedure is\nnow beginning,\u201d Oncken said by telephone. \u201cThe books are being\nopened and we are looking at the business in detail. We will see\nif it can be restructured.\u201d  Lufthansa,  Europe \u2019s second-biggest airline, is seeking a\nbuyer for the bmibaby discount unit after agreeing last month to\nsell BMI to British Airways parent  International Consolidated\nAirlines Group SA (IAG)  for 172.5 million pounds ($267 million). Other\nparties are also interested in the low-cost arm, BMI said today.  Oncken said that, from initial figures, bmibaby could\nprobably be restructured \u201crelatively quickly,\u201d though the\noperation is closely integrated with the rest of BMI. Intro\nAviation would draw on its experience in turning around former\nBritish Airways unit Deutsche BA and  Germany \u2019s LTU, he said.  \u201cThere are ongoing talks, but we can\u2019t give any further\ndetails,\u201d Lufthansa spokeswoman Claudia Lange said. The\nCologne-based carrier, which has said it wants to conclude the\nmain deal with IAG this quarter,  closed  0.1 percent lower at\n10.16 euros in  Frankfurt .  \u2018Several\u2019 Bidders  BMI aims to conclude a sale of bmibaby \u201cas soon as\npossible,\u201d it said in response to an e-mail seeking comment.  \u201cThere are several interested parties and we are in the\nprocess of identifying the preferred buyer,\u201d the company said,\nadding that a deal has also been concluded with a U.K. buyer for\nits BMI Regional arm, subject to \u201ccertain preconditions.\u201d  The regional unit operates from cities including Aberdeen,\nEdinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland and Manchester in northwest\n England  using a fleet of 19  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  ERJ-135 and ERJ-145 jets,\naccording to data compiled by aviation consultancy Ascend.  London-based IAG, which wants BMI for the take-off and\nlanding slots at the U.K. capital\u2019s crowded Heathrow airport\nused by its mainline operation, will get a discount on the\npurchase price if Lufthansa fails to offload bmibaby.  IAG  (IAG) rose\n2.4 percent before closing up 1.3 percent at 167.60 pence.  Boeing Fleet  Bmibaby, based in  Castle Donington  in central England,\noperates 12  Boeing Co. (BA)  737-300 aircraft and two 737-500 variants\nfrom bases at nearby East Midlands and Birmingham airports and\nfrom  Belfast  in  Northern Ireland .  The unit had a loss of about 120 million euros ($129\nmillion) last year, according to Credit Suisse Group analyst\nNeil Glynn, who has \u201cneutral\u201d ratings on Lufthansa and IAG.  Given that the German airline has agreed to reduce BMI\u2019s\nselling price should it fail to dispose of bmibaby, the company\nwill be \u201cessentially paying restructuring costs to someone to\ntake it off their hands,\u201d London-based Glynn said.  Intro Aviation was founded by Oncken and German retail\nentrepreneur  Hans Rudolf Wohrl , who previously ran Nuremburg-\nbased carrier NFD before selling the company to Eurowings in\n1992, according to Intro\u2019s website.  Wohrl became CEO of Deutsche BA in 2003, having initially\nbeing hired by British Airways to shut the German unit. After\nrefocusing the company, known as DBA, on the high-frequency\nbusiness travel market, it was sold to  Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  in 2006.  LTU was acquired by Intro Aviation in the same year that\nDBA was sold, with Oncken as CEO and Wohrl as chairman. It was\nalso bought by Air Berlin, in 2007, the website says.  \u201cI think it is dependent upon the experience we have\ngathered over the decades,\u201d Oncken said of Intro\u2019s interest in\nbmibaby. \u201cI can\u2019t at this stage say whether it would be like\nthe Deutsche BA model.\u201d  Intro Aviation also has a number of other parallel airline\nprojects, including a commuter carrier in the Caribbean, which\nit \u201cmay be interested in integrating,\u201d the executive said,\nwithout specifying what the nature of any synergies might be.
