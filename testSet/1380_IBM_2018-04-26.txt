The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nBy Jonathan Vanian April 25, 2018\nThe United Kingdom is planning a big investment in artificial intelligence technologies in a deal worth nearly \u00a31 billion, or about $1.3 billion.\nThe U.K. government said Thursday that part of its multi-year AI investment\u2013about \u00a3300 million, or more than $400 million\u2013would come from U.K.-based corporations and investment firms and those located outside the country.\nSome of the U.S.-based companies involved with the U.K.\u2019s AI deal include Microsoft , Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM , McKinsey, and Pfizer , but the U.K. did not say how much each firm was planning to individually invest. A few of these U.S. companies helped consult on an earlier independent review on developing AI in the U.K. that the government is using as a template for its new initiative.\nAntony Phillipson, the United Kingdom\u2019s trade commissioner for North America, said that the investments are part of a broader set of initiatives the U.K. government is undertaking to address several areas U.K. lawmakers believe will soon affect the country\u2019s economy and society. These include revamping the company\u2019s transportation infrastructure, investing in clean energy, and dealing with an aging populace.\nRegarding artificial intelligence, Phillipson said that the rise of cutting-edge data-crunching technologies have the potential to \u201ctransform a whole host of sectors,\u201d whether they be life sciences and the development of new drugs or improved manufacturing.\nAs part of the deal, the Japanese venture capital firm Global Brain plans to invest about $48 million in U.K. tech startups and will open a European headquarters in the United Kingdom. The University of Cambridge will also give U.K. businesses access to a new $13 million supercomputer to help with AI-related projects.\nCanadian venture capital firm Chrysalix will also open a European headquarters in the U.K. and plans to invest more than $100 million in local startups specializing in AI and robotics.\nThe U.K.\u2019s investments to bolster the state of AI in the country follow recent endeavors by other nations like France and China . Advances in AI technologies like deep learning have led to feats like the ability to teach computers to quickly recognize patterns in enormous quantities of data.\nPhillipson concedes that AI itself is a broad topic, and while deep learning appears to be driving much of the innovation in the research world, the U.K. will also invest in startups that are not specifically focused on that particular subset of AI. They just have to show some sort of capability in \u201cexploiting big data\u201d that can lead to advancements in other areas like life sciences, he said.\nThe U.K. will also create a \u201cData Ethics and Innovation\u201d center worth about $12 million that\u2019s intended to help address some of the ethical issues arising out of AI technologies. Numerous research organizations have called for technologists, government, and companies to address some of the issues AI and increased automation could have on society, like its potential to displace jobs and lead to powerful weapons used in warfare .\nPhillipson didn\u2019t provide specific details on the center\u2019s plans, but said they would include creating some sort of universal framework governing the ethical use of AI, and how that framework should be implemented. This could involve legislative measures, codes of conduct, or a more hands-off approach from government in which businesses will lead the efforts.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune\u2019s technology newsletter.\nRegarding China and its desire to become the world\u2019s leader in AI technologies by 2030, Philipson said that \u201cChina is making a big play and investing considerable amounts of money.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019re looking to compete with China on that scale,\u201d he added.\n\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was 116.36471557617188 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of International Business Machines Corporation was ",
