 "context": "The following article called 'Bank Foreign Branches Said to Face Tougher U.S. Swaps Rules' was published on 2012-05-10. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nThe main U.S. swaps regulator may\ndetermine how much of a bank\u2019s foreign trading activity will be\nsubject to regulation under the Dodd-Frank Act based on whether\nthe firm conducts the trades from branches or affiliates,\naccording to people familiar with the discussions.  Gary Gensler , chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission, may recommend to his fellow commissioners that\nregulators use the legal distinction between a branch and an\naffiliate as the basis for applying new derivatives rules to\nU.S. banks\u2019 overseas trades with foreign customers, said the\npeople, who asked not to be named because the discussions are\nprivate.  Branches would face more restrictions because they are\nlegally part of the U.S. banking entity, the people said.\nAffiliates are often separately capitalized and could be\noverseen by overseas regulators if the agency considers the\nforeign country\u2019s regulatory regime comparable, they said.  The debate over the reach of the U.S. financial-overhaul\nlaw is one of the most contentious aspects of the effort to\nbolster oversight of the  derivatives market . The commission is\nseeking to prevent a repeat of the takeover of  American\nInternational Group Inc. (AIG) , which was seized by the U.S.\ngovernment in 2008 after its London-based unit sold credit-\ndefault swaps on mortgage-backed securities with little U.S.\noversight.  Foreign Rivals  U.S. banks have said that Dodd-Frank rules will hurt their\nability to compete with foreign-based rivals if the rules are\napplied to overseas offices. Banking lobbyists have argued that\nforeign supervision of their overseas arms and Federal Reserve\noversight of the U.S. holding companies is sufficient to protect\nagainst risk to the financial system.  \u201cThese are international markets so the reach of Dodd\nFrank will have a very big impact on how the banks and their\ncustomers fare under these regulations,\u201d said Craig Pirrong, a\nfinance professor at the  University of Houston . European and\nAsian regulatory decisions will be important to the final shape\nof the rules, Pirrong added.  Steve Adamske , a CFTC spokesman, declined to comment. The\nCFTC will release its decision as proposed interpretive\nguidance, which will go through a public-comment period before a\nfinal vote is required to pass the measures, the people said.\nGensler has been working with CFTC staff on the proposal and is\nclose to sharing it with the four other commissioners, one of\nthe people said.  Different Structures  The five largest U.S. financial firms organize their\noverseas operations differently.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Citigroup\nInc. (C)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  conduct foreign swaps trading\nthrough branches, according to bank representatives. Morgan\nStanley operates most of its overseas trading through\naffiliates, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n Michael DuVally , a  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  spokesman, refused\nto say how the bank conducts its overseas swaps business.  Those five banking holding companies account for 95 percent\nof the $304 trillion in notional amount in the American market,\n according  to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.\nGlobally, the notional amount of over-the-counter derivatives is\nestimated at  $708 trillion , according to the  Bank for\nInternational Settlements  in  Basel ,  Switzerland .  Citigroup\u2019s \u201cforeign activity is conducted through a\ncombination of branches and affiliates,\u201d Scott Helfman, a\nspokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. He declined to comment\non the CFTC debate.  Justin Perras , a JPMorgan spokesman, DuVally\nof Goldman Sachs, John Yiannacopoulos, a Bank of America\nspokesman, and  Morgan Stanley (MS) \u2019s Mary Claire Delaney declined to\ncomment.  Branches versus Affiliates  Pirrong said the distinction between branches and\naffiliates could be a challenge to implement.  \u201cThere\u2019s a continuum of relationships between affiliates\nand parent,\u201d Pirrong said, referring to parent companies.\n\u201cDrawing bright lines between them is difficult.\u201d  Global regulators have been meeting to reach consensus on\nnew standards for clearing, capital and margin for derivatives\nin an effort to prevent banks from exploiting regulatory\ndifferences. Gensler said May 2 that the CFTC may institute a\nsystem of so-called substituted compliance, in which U.S.\nregulators would determine if overseas rules are sufficient to\ncomply with Dodd-Frank. If an overseas jurisdiction doesn\u2019t have\ncomparable regulation, the CFTC wouldn\u2019t allow the substituted\ncompliance, Gensler said at the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association Inc.\u2019s annual meeting.  \u2018Skirting\u2019 the Law  \u201cIf your question is, \u2018Can two U.S. parties go to some\njurisdiction that doesn\u2019t have an execution requirement to skirt\naround the law,\u2019 then the answer would be no -- until you find\ngood lawyers to skirt around it,\u201d he said.  A related question to how U.S. bank affiliates would fare\nunder Dodd Frank involves what parts of the law to apply to\ntheir activity, the people said. Gensler is considering two\noptions, they said.  The first option would be to apply the rules meant for\nbank-holding companies, such as capital that must be set aside\nagainst the size of the swaps-trading portfolio, the people\nsaid. The second option would be to apply transaction rules,\nincluding requirements that most swaps must be processed with\nclearinghouses which require margin to back the trades and be\ntraded on exchanges or similar electronic systems, they said.  In March, the House Financial Services Committee approved a\nbill that would limit the CFTC\u2019s ability to apply its rules to\nforeign-based arms of U.S. banks when trading with overseas\nclients. The House has yet to schedule a vote, and the Senate\nhasn\u2019t considered similar legislation.
