Italian issuers are favoring covered notes, which are\nbacked by mortgages and public sector loans and typically have\nhigher credit rankings, amid downgrades of their senior\nunsecured debt. Mediobanca was cut one step to BBB by Standard &\nPoor\u2019s in July, while the ratings firm lowered Banca Popolare\nEmilia to BB- in August.  \u201cWe are seeing a run to covered bonds from Italian issuers\nbecause they fear downgrades of their senior debt and feel more\nprotected in covered bonds,\u201d said Jose Sarafana, a credit\nsalesman at Aurel Bgc in Paris. \u201cWe are also seeing a switch\namong Italian investors towards covered bonds.\u201d  Mediobanca mandated  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Societe Generale SA,\n UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and its own dealing department for a deal backed\nby prime Italian residential mortgages.
