 "context": "The following article called 'Indicted Trader Kupersmith Plans Guilty Plea, Lawyer Says' was published on 2012-04-25. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nScott Kupersmith, who was charged\nwith taking part in a scheme involving $60 million in illegal\nstock trades, intends to plead guilty to fraud and grand larceny\nin  New York , his lawyer said.  Prosecutors said Kupersmith, 47, used assumed identities to\ncreate five shell companies employed in the scheme and defrauded\nat least six broker-dealers of more than $830,000.  A hearing scheduled for today before New York State Supreme\nCourt Justice Maxwell Wiley in Manhattan was postponed until May\n9 because Kupersmith\u2019s attorney, Leonard Levenson, didn\u2019t show\nup. Kupersmith, who is in federal custody in a related case, was\nin court for the scheduled hearing. He didn\u2019t speak during the\nproceeding.  \u201cThis is the tail of the dog,\u201d Levenson said later,\nreferring to the state charges. \u201cHis plea will have little\nconsequence on the time he spends in jail,\u201d the lawyer, who\narrived after today\u2019s proceeding was postponed, said in an\ninterview outside court.  Manhattan  District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.\u2019s office had no\ncomment on a plea, Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman, said in a phone\ninterview.  Plea Negotiations  Plea negotiations with federal prosecutors are under way in\nNew Jersey, where Kupersmith was charged with securities and\nwire fraud in October, according to a court document filed on\nMarch 15. Lisa Mack, an attorney with the federal public\ndefender\u2019s office in New Jersey who is representing Kupersmith\nthere, didn\u2019t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking\ncomment.  Kupersmith, of  Boca Raton ,  Florida , and formerly of Alpine,\nNew Jersey, was arrested in Florida in October after a joint\ninvestigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in New Jersey and\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to court\ndocuments and a  statement  from Vance\u2019s office. He is in federal\ncustody in Essex County, New Jersey.  Kupersmith and others are accused of taking part in a\nscheme known as \u201cfree-riding,\u201d where a customer buys or sells\nsecurities in a brokerage account without having the money or\nsecurities to pay for them, according to a court document filed\nby federal prosecutors in New Jersey.  \u201cFree-riders\u201d typically cover their purchases by buying\nshares of the same security on the same day through another\nfirm, and attempt to profit from short-term price changes\nwithout putting personal assets at risk, according to the court\nfiling.  Brokerage Accounts  Kupersmith and associates opened more than three dozen\nbrokerage accounts in 2008 and 2009, including nine separate\naccounts at firms located in  New Jersey  and elsewhere,\nprosecutors said in the court filing.  Kupersmith asked that each account be opened as a\n\u201cdelivery-versus-payment,\u201d or DVP, account, which allows\nclients to buy or sell securities with one firm and settle them\nwith cash or securities from an account at another firm,\naccording to the court filing.  Brokerage firms \u201cgenerally\u201d only allow institutional\ncustomers or individuals with high net worth to open DVP\naccounts, and Kupersmith \u201cfalsely represented\u201d to the firms\nthat he had a personal net worth of about $5 million and ran a\nhedge fund with a liquid net worth of about $10 million to $20\nmillion, according to the court filing.  Kupersmith traded securities including shares of  Baidu\nInc. (BIDU) , the owner of  China \u2019s dominant search engine, and  CME Group\nInc. (CME) , the parent company of the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,\nprosecutors said in the filing.  Failed to Settle  Starting in about October 2009, Kupersmith failed to settle\nmany of the trades, including orders to sell about 48,700 shares\nof Baidu for $15 million that he failed to deliver, forcing two\nof the brokerage firms to buy the stock on the open market and\nlose more than $600,000, prosecutors said. Kupersmith also used\nthe personal information of a relative and a friend to open\nadditional accounts.  Kupersmith used the accounts to buy about $64 million worth\nof securities, and made more than $1.2 million through the\nillegal trades, according to a statement from Vance\u2019s office.\nThe broker-dealers, which include Morgan Keegan & Co., William\nBlair & Co. and JPMorgan Securities LLC, lost more than\n$830,000, Vance\u2019s office said.  Kupersmith also solicited investors to invest in a hedge\nfund he claimed to control, telling them it had an annual return\nof about 30 percent and that he had personally made more than $1\nmillion in the past year, prosecutors said in the documents. He\ntold investors their principal was guaranteed, and told at least\none potential investor that he would get a return of about 43\npercent every three months.  $500,000 Raised  Kupersmith raised about $500,000 for the non-existent hedge\nfund, which he used to pay for flights, limos, luxury hotel\nrooms and visits to adult entertainment clubs, as well as to\nfund the investment scheme and make payments to other investors,\nprosecutors said.  Kupersmith faces as long as 20 years in prison and a $5\nmillion fine for each of the charges against him in New Jersey.\nHe also faces a civil suit filed by the SEC.  Levenson said he would take the case to trial in New York\nif the proposed sentence attached to the plea deal carried\nadditional jail time.  \u201cIt\u2019s a little iffy as to whether he committed the fraud\nthat was outlined in the indictment,\u201d Levenson said.\n\u201cEssentially what he did was he exaggerated his net worth in\norder to obtain credit with broker dealers.\u201d  The New York case is People v. Kupersmith, 04360-2011, New\nYork state  Supreme Court  (Manhattan). The New Jersey cases are\nU.S. v. Kupersmith, 11-mj-03750, and Securities and Exchange\nCommission v. Kupersmith, 11-cv-06277, U.S. District Court,\nDistrict of New Jersey (Newark).
