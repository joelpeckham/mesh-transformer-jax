 "context": "The following article called 'Wal-Mart Aims to Reach India Agreement With Bharti in Few Weeks' was published on 2013-10-05. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nWal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world\u2019s\nlargest retailer, said it is in talks with Indian partner Bharti\nEnterprises Pvt. on its future business plan and aims to reach\nan agreement in the next few weeks.  Wal-Mart has a \u201cvery good\u201d relationship with Bharti and\nhas had multiple conversations with billionaire owner Sunil Mittal in the past few days to determine the next steps,  Scott\nPrice , head of Wal-Mart\u2019s Asia operations, said yesterday. His\ncomments come after local media reports in  India  suggested that\nBharti is seeking to exit the joint venture due to Wal-Mart\u2019s\nlack of progress in expanding Indian operations.  \u201cWe are having very productive discussions with Bharti,\nthere are multiple options and we are working through what those\noptions might be,\u201d Price said in a telephone interview. \u201cI\nwould hope probably in the next several weeks we will reach an\nagreement with them. But no matter what happens, there is no\npressure in the relationship.\u201d  While the nation changed laws in September last year to\nallow foreign retailers to own majority stakes in multibrand\nretail chains, no global retailers have sought such licenses\nyet. The government also loosened rules covering sourcing,\ninfrastructure investment and store location in August, in an\neffort to woo Wal-Mart, Tesco Plc and other global chains to\nopen retail stores in  Asia \u2019s third-biggest economy.  Sticking Point  Under the recently amended rules, foreign-owned retailers\nwill have to buy 30 percent of manufactured products from small-and medium-sized local firms with less than $2 million invested\nin factories and machinery. Earlier rules were stricter,\ndefining \u201csmall and medium\u201d companies as those with\ninvestments of under $1 million. Even after these changes, the\nentry barriers for foreign retailers \u201caren\u2019t workable,\u201d Price\nsaid.  Wal-Mart\u2019s Asia head said these rules still don\u2019t provide a\nlevel playing field for international retailers compared to\nlocal rivals, and the need to comply with them is the \u201cbiggest\nsticking point\u201d holding back the company\u2019s foray into\ntraditional retail in India.  \u201cUntil the sourcing issue is resolved, I believe no\nforeign company will apply and can comply,\u201d Price said from\nBali where he was attending the Asia-Pacific Economic\nCooperation forum. He is the chairman of the National Center for\nAPEC, a U.S. business group. \u201cWe are not interested in\ninvesting until that\u2019s clear.  \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the negotiations that we have been\nundertaking for some time with the government means that there\u2019s\nan opportunity for us to invest directly into retail in India,\u201d\nhe said.  The Bharti and Wal-Mart joint venture operates wholesale\ncash-and-carry stores, that are similar to  Costco Wholesale\nCorp. (COST)  outlets in that they allow entry only to registered\nmembers who would include restaurants and local retailers.\nForeign investment in such stores is subject to fewer government\nrestrictions in India than retail outlets.  Store Expansion  The venture opened its first wholesale store in the\nnorthern city of Amritsar in May 2009, and now operates 20 such\noutlets in the country. New store openings have slowed, with the\ncompany\u2019s most recent being almost a year ago, according to its\n website .  The halt in store expansion comes as the company faced two\ngovernment probes and carried out an internal investigation on\npossible violations of U.S. anti-corruption laws in India. The\nAmerican retailer has also suspended some senior staff in recent\nmonths.  CEO Departure  In June, Wal-Mart\u2019s chief executive officer of the India\njoint venture, Raj Jain, left the company amid government and\ninternal investigations. His departure came seven months after\nPankaj Madan, the venture\u2019s chief financial officer, was among\nexecutives suspended. Madan has since been hired by billionaire\nMittal\u2019s  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , India\u2019s biggest mobile-phone\noperator, the Economic Times  reported  in August.  Price said yesterday the company is putting in place better\ncompliance mechanisms and declined to comment on expansion\nplans.  \u201cWe love the cash-and-carry format. We are committed to\nIndia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process by which we have stood back to\nreinforce our compliance and to invest in the basics of the\nbusiness has not signaled a lack of interest in the format.\u201d  The Economic Times  reported  on Sept. 12 that Wal-Mart was\nconsidering whether to continue its business or exit its\noperations in India, and that the company expected to make a\ndecision by the end of the month. It will also decide whether it\nwants to keep Bharti as its partner, according to the article.  \u201cLike in many instances, speculation has got nothing to do\nwith reality,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t talking to other\npartners. The relationship is good.\u201d  To contact the reporters on this story:\nAdi Narayan in Mumbai at \n anarayan8@bloomberg.net ;\nStephanie Wong in  Hong Kong  at \n swong139@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:\nStephanie Wong at \n swong139@bloomberg.net\n\n    The day before the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was 60.32563400268555 and the day after the article was published, the stock price of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. was ",
