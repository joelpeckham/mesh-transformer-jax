 "context": "The following article called 'Google, Cisco, Amazon, RIM, Weinstein: Intellectual Property' was published on 2012-06-04. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nGoogle Inc. filed an antitrust\ncomplaint with the European Commission against  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) \nand  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , saying the companies are using patents to thwart\ncompetition.  The complaint focuses on a transfer Nokia and Microsoft\nmade last year of some 2,000 patents and patent applications to\nMosaid Technologies Inc., a Canadian company known for its\npatent litigation, said Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Google.\nMost of the patents relate to industry standards for wireless\ntechnology, and Microsoft has publicly pledged it wouldn\u2019t use\nsuch patents to block competitors from the market.  \u201cNokia and Microsoft are colluding to raise the costs of\nmobile devices for consumers, creating patent trolls that side-\nstep promises both companies have made,\u201d  Mountain View ,\nCalifornia-based Google said in an e-mailed statement, using a\npejorative term for companies that use patents only to demand\nroyalties rather than to make products.  Microsoft and Nokia get a share of any proceeds Mosaid\nraises from licensing the patents.  Google\u2019s complaint may prompt an investigation by the same\nEuropean Union antitrust authority that is probing Google\u2019s\nMotorola Mobility over its use of so-called standard-essential\npatents in litigation against Microsoft and Apple Inc. The EU\ninvestigations were triggered by complaints by those two\ncompanies.  A copy of Google\u2019s complaint wasn\u2019t available.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the European Commission\nin Brussels, confirmed that regulators had received the filing\nand said they would examine it.  Nokia hasn\u2019t yet seen the \u201cfrivolous\u201d complaint, Mark\nDurrant, a spokesman for Nokia, said in an e-mailed statement.  Companies get together to establish standards so that\nproducts can work together, such as for Wi-Fi, video compression\nor digital transmissions. Those that help establish the\nstandards pledge to license their patents on fair and reasonable\nterms.  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has criticized Motorola\nMobility, which Google acquired earlier this month, for its use\nof standard-essential patents to seek orders that would block\nsales of Microsoft\u2019s products. The software maker is awaiting a\njudge\u2019s ruling on claims Motorola Mobility breached its\nobligations.  Mosaid hasn\u2019t seen Google\u2019s complaint and so couldn\u2019t\ncomment, said Michael Salter, a Mosaid spokesman. The company\nwas taken private in December in a transaction led by Chicago-\nbased Sterling Partners.  Mosaid\u2019s Core Wireless unit, which holds the patents\nobtained from Microsoft and Nokia, filed a patent suit in\nFebruary against Apple over some of the standard-essential\npatents.  Mosaid sold five patent families for $11 million in\nSeptember. Google was later identified as the buyer.  Cisco Seeks Court Ruling DVRs Don\u2019t Infringe TiVo\u2019s Patents  Cisco Systems Inc. sued  TiVo Inc. (TIVO)  seeking a court order\ndeclaring it hasn\u2019t infringed patents relating to digital video\nrecorders.  TiVo, maker of set-top boxes that can record and play back\ntelevision programs, has sued companies that purchase DVRs made\nby Cisco alleging they infringe TiVo patents, Cisco said in a\ncomplaint filed in federal court in San Jose,  California .  Cisco, a maker of computer-networking equipment, said the\ncompanies have had discussions in which TiVo indicated \u201cthat it\ndid not want to broadly license TiVo technology to Cisco because\nproviding any such license to a DVR manufacturer such as Cisco\nwould interfere with TiVo\u2019s\u201d patent lawsuits against Cisco\ncustomers.  Cisco, based in San Jose, is seeking a court order that its\nDVR technology doesn\u2019t infringe TiVo\u2019s patents to halt the set-\ntop maker from continuing to sue Cisco customers, according to\nthe complaint  Jessica Loebig, a spokeswoman for Alviso, California-based\nTiVo, didn\u2019t immediately return a voice-mail message seeking\ncomment about the lawsuit.  AT&T Inc., a Cisco customer, agreed to pay at least $215\nmillion in January to settle a TiVo patent lawsuit over DVRs.\nTiVo has cases pending against Microsoft Corp. and Verizon\nCommunications Inc., according to the Cisco complaint filed May\n30.  The case is Cisco v. TiVo, 12-2766, U.S. District Court,\nNorthern District of California ( San Jose ).  Amazon Gets \u2018Electronic Gifting\u2019 Patent for Downloadable Media  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world\u2019s largest online retailer,\nreceived a patent on a technology that may help put an end to\nunused gift cards and gift certificates.  According to a March 2011 Bloomberg report, as many as 20\npercent of plastic gift cards are never or only partially used,\nand the average U.S. household has about five such cards on hand\nwith a total value of more than $100.  Amazon\u2019s patent 8,190,519, issued May 29, covers what the\nSeattle-based retailer calls \u201celectronic gifting.\u201d The patent\nnotes that it \u201cis not unusual for a gift certificate not to be\nredeemed by a recipient, wasting the money the giver spent.\u201d  Electronic gifting covers a method of giving electronically\ntransferrable items such as music, games, movies, ring tones,\nmagazines or books. Recipients of such gifts can select and\ntransfer items within minutes, without leaving their homes or\nwaiting for physical delivery through the mail.  Amazon applied for the patent in September 2008 with the\nassistance of  Irvine , California\u2019s Knobbe, Martens, Olson & Bear\nLLP.  For more patent news, click here.  Trademark  RIM Can Continue to Use \u2018BBM\u2019 for BlackBerry Messenger Service  Research In Motion (RIM) , the Waterloo, Ontario-based maker of\nthe BlackBerry mobile device, can continue to use \u201cBBM\u201d as an\nacronym for its BlackBerry Messenger Service, the Toronto Star\n reported .  A Canadian federal court dismissed the trademark-\ninfringement case brought by BBM Canada, an organization based\nin North York, Ontario, which provides radio broadcast rankings,\naccording to the Star.  The court said that the two entities\u2019 operations were in\nsufficiently distinct segments of the economy that no\ninfringement occurred, the newspaper reported.  BBM Chief Executive Officer Jim MacLeod told the Star his\ncompany hadn\u2019t decided whether to review the decision, and that\nBBM Canada could be forced to change its name.  Weinstein Co. Wins Dismissal of \u2018Soul Men\u2019 Trademark Suit  Soul singer  Sam Moore \u2019s trademark-infringement case against\nthe Weinstein Co. was dismissed by a federal judge in  Tennessee .  Moore sued the New York-based Weinstein Co. motion picture\nproduction company in 2009, claiming its 2008 \u201c Soul Men \u201d film\nstarring Samuel L. Jackson infringed his trademarks and\npublicity rights.  In court papers accompanying her order dismissing the case,\nU.S. District Judge Aleta A. Trauger said Moore -- best known as\na member of the Sam & Dave singing duo -- presented witnesses\nwhose testimony didn\u2019t meet federal standards for admissibility,\nand that the marks he claimed were infringed were weak at best.  Additionally, she found the film to which Moore objected is\nfictional, so the performer\u2019s privacy rights weren\u2019t violated.  The case is Moore V. Weinstein Co., 3:09-cv-00166, U.S.\nDistrict Court, Middle District of Tennessee (Nashville).  For more trademark news, click here.  Copyright  Google Loses Bid to Dismiss Claims in Digital Book Case  Google Inc. (GOOG) \u2019s bid to dismiss claims by groups including the\nAuthor\u2019s Guild and the American Society of Media Photographers\nin two lawsuits over electronic books was denied by a judge in\n New York .  U.S. Circuit Judge  Denny Chin , sitting as a federal trial\njudge in the case, rejected Google\u2019s arguments that the groups\nlacked standing to sue over claims the search engine company\u2019s\ndigital scanning of millions of books infringed the copyright\nowners\u2019 rights.  Chin also granted a request for three individual plaintiffs\nto represent a nationwide class of copyright holders in the\nAuthor\u2019s Guild suit.  \u201cGiven the sweeping and undiscriminating nature of\nGoogle\u2019s unauthorized copying, it would be unjust to require\nthat each affected association member litigate his claim\nindividually,\u201d the judge said.  The suits stem from Google\u2019s plan, announced in 2004, to\ndigitally scan books from public and university libraries to\nprovide short snippets of text to people who use its Internet\nsearch engine. The Authors Guild, individual authors and\npublishing companies sued in 2005, claiming the Mountain View,\nCalifornia-based company hadn\u2019t sought authorization from the\nowners of the works.  \u201cAs we\u2019ve said all along, we are confident that  Google\nBooks  is fully compliant with copyright law,\u201d Maggie Shiels, a\nGoogle spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. The decision\n\u201c doesn\u2019t determine the underlying merits of the case, nor does\nit resolve the lawsuit.\u201d  Google has argued that the display of snippets of text is\nfair use under copyright law. Chin asked Google June 1 why it\nwas important at this stage of the case to determine the\nownership of the copyrights.  Google said in a February court filing that it has scanned\nmore than 20 million books, and that Web users can see excerpts\nin English from more than 4 million of them. The project began\nwith the digitizing of books from the libraries of the\n University of Michigan ,  Harvard University ,  Stanford University ,\nOxford University and the  New York Public Library .  The judge last year declined to approve a proposed\nsettlement, saying it was \u201can attempt to use the class action\nmechanism to implement forward-looking business arrangements\nthat go far beyond the dispute before the court.\u201d      The\nauthors\u2019 case is Authors Guild v. Google, 05-08136; the visual\nartists\u2019 case is American Society of Media Photographers v.\nGoogle, 10-02977; U.S. District Court, Southern District of New\nYork ( Manhattan ).  Wiley Sues Doe Defendants Over BitTorrent Book Downloading  John Wiley & Sons Ltd. (JW/A) , a publisher of technical and\nscientific texts, filed two copyright-infringement suits in\nfederal court in Manhattan on May 30.  The two cases are against unnamed defendants who allegedly\nused the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol to download and\ndistribute copies of two Wiley books without authorization. Most\nof the other unauthorized-downloading cases in the past have\ninvolved music or films instead of books.  One suit claims 22 unnamed defendants used BitTorrent to\nshare Wiley\u2019s \u201cWindows 7 Secrets.\u201d The other suit was filed\nwith regard to Wiley\u2019s \u201cThe Six-Figure Second Income,\u201d and\nlists 24 unnamed defendants.  In both cases, the Hoboken, New Jersey-based publisher says\nthe defendants\u2019 actions threaten its profitability, and a\ndecline in sales, should the unauthorized distribution continue\nunchecked, could cause some of its authors \u201cto stop writing\nbooks altogether.\u201d  Wiley asked the court to order the defendants to halt their\ninfringing activities, and for awards of money damages,\nincluding extra damages to punish the defendants for their\nactions.  The publisher is represented by William Irvin Dinnegan and\nBenjamin Daniel Liebowitz of Dinnegan & Scileppi LLC of New\nYork.  The cases are Wiley v. John Doe, 1:12-cv-04231-PAC and\n1:12-cv-04232-PAC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New\nYork (Manhattan).  For more copyright news, click here.
