 "context": "The following article called 'Repsol Buys Back 10% Stake as Biggest Investor Hits Loan Deadline' was published on 2011-12-20. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nRepsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain\u2019s largest oil\nproducer, bought 10 percent of its own shares for about $3.35\nbillion from its largest stockholder, helping the construction\ncompany repay about half of a syndicated loan due tomorrow.  Repsol paid  Sacyr (SYV)  Vallehermoso SA a 5 percent discount to\nyesterday\u2019s price, allowing Sacyr to refinance the balance of\nits loan for three years, Repsol Chairman  Antonio Brufau  said\ntoday. Sacyr sold the shares at 21.07 euros apiece, valuing the\ndiscounted stake at 2.57 billion euros ($3.35 billion) and\nresulting in a loss for the builder of 940 million euros.  Sacyr had struggled to roll over a 4.9 billion-euro credit\nused to buy its 20 percent stake. The deal keeps the shares from\nbeing seized in a foreclosure that would have led banks to sell\nthe stock on the market, depressing Repsol\u2019s price, analysts\nsaid. Madrid-based Sacyr salvaged half its holding, preserving\none of its main sources of cash. Repsol has a 4.9 percent\ndividend yield.  Brufau \u201cprevented a disorderly unwinding of the Sacyr\ninterest and in that regard it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d  Jason Gammel ,\nan analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in  London , said by telephone.\n\u201cGiven the growth strategy and the investment opportunities\nthat they have, it\u2019s less likely they\u2019ll hold the position for a\nlong period of time, but they certainly have the financial cap\nto do so.\u201d  Shares Gain  Sacyr jumped as much as 11 percent in Madrid, the most\nsince August, after trading in the stock resumed this afternoon.\nIt was up 7.4 percent at 4.325 euros as of 3:58 p.m. local time.\nRepsol rose 0.7 percent to 22.33 euros.  Repsol intends to sell the stake \u201cwithin months\u201d to a\nlong-term partner that supports its strategy, Chief Financial\nOfficer Miguel Martinez said today on a call for analysts. It\nwon\u2019t sell the shares on the market since the deal is aimed at\npreventing the holding from weighing on the stock price, Brufau\nsaid at a briefing in Moscow on an unrelated venture.  \u201cWe are taking some time, not much, but some time to think\nwhere we place that stake,\u201d Brufau said. \u201cThat may be for\nfinancial institutions or to industrial investors, or even\nkeeping it in our hands because this is a very good\ninvestment.\u201d  Some of the shares may be used to pay dividends, the\ncompany said in a regulatory filing.  Loan Refinancing  Sacyr had borrowed 5.2 billion euros from a syndicate of at\nleast 25 banks in December 2006 to finance its Repsol investment\nas then-Chairman Luis del Rivero sought to hedge the company\u2019s\nexposure to  Spain \u2019s construction industry. It has refinanced\n2.45 billion euros of loans, Sacyr said today.  The company paid an average of 26.70 euros for its Repsol\nshares, and said today it took a loss of 940 million euros on\nthe sale, net of costs and tax. Sacyr\u2019s equity amounted to 3.99\nbillion euros at the end of the third quarter, according to its\nearnings report for the period.  The investment had soured as Repsol\u2019s stock tumbled to as\nlow as 11.64 euros in March 2009 from about 27 euros. Sacyr was\nforced to pledge its Testa property unit as additional\ncollateral in November 2008.  Del Rivero, who became vice chairman of Repsol, agitated\nfor the  oil company  to boost dividend payments to ease Sacyr\u2019s\nfinancial strain, clashing with Repsol\u2019s Brufau, who chose to\ninvest in exploration instead.  Repsol had 5.6 billion euros of cash and short-term\nsecurities on its balance sheet at the end of the third quarter.  Del Rivero was fired by Sacyr in October after allying with\n Petroleos Mexicanos , Repsol\u2019s third-biggest investor, to try to\nforce Brufau to cede. He was replaced with Manuel Manrique.  The alliance with Pemex will now be dissolved, Sacyr said\nin a filing. Under the terms of the agreement, the accord is\nannulled without penalties should either party sell at least\nhalf of its Repsol shares, a Pemex spokesman said yesterday.
