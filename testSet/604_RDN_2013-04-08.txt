 "context": "The following article called 'Intrade Shortfall, BOE Stress, Borsa Istanbul: Compliance' was published on 2013-04-08. The body of the article is as follows:\n    \nIntrade , the betting website that\nhalted trading last month amid a probe into suspected financial\nirregularities, told customers it has found a $700,000 shortfall\nin client funds as it seeks their backing for a survival plan.  The Dublin-based company uncovered the shortfall after\ncomparing cash on hand and in member accounts with balances on\nthe exchange\u2019s system, Ronald Bernstein, who became a director\nin November and is leading the rescue effort, said in an e-mail\nto clients, a copy of which was obtained by  Bloomberg News . He\nconfirmed the letter\u2019s contents.  Intrade, which let people bet against one another on the\noutcomes of events, such as U.S. presidential elections, stopped\ntaking wagers and froze member accounts on March 10 after saying\nit had uncovered suspected financial irregularities. The company\nis now asking members to accept immediate repayment of half\ntheir frozen money and waive claims to the rest on the \u201csolemn\npromise\u201d that Intrade will try to refund that later.  Investors have until April 9 to sign up to the plan, he\nwrote. The company is still in \u201cactive\u201d talks with investors,\nBernstein said.  Compliance Policy  BOE Says Investors May Be Taking \u2018Too Rosy\u2019 a View of Stress  The  Bank of England  said rising equity markets don\u2019t\nreflect the underlying economic situation and warned that\ninvestors may be underestimating risks in the financial system.  Gains by equities since mid-2012 \u201cin part reflected\nexceptionally accommodative monetary policies by many central\nbanks,\u201d the BOE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee said April 5 in\nLondon in the minutes of its March 19 meeting. \u201cIt was also\nconsistent with a perception among some contacts that the most\nsignificant downside risks had attenuated. But market sentiment\nmay be taking too rosy a view of the underlying stresses.\u201d  At the meeting, the FPC recommended that U.K. lenders raise\n25 billion pounds ($38 billion) of additional capital to cover\nbigger potential losses, possible fines for mis-selling and\nstricter risk models. While banks have strengthened their\nresilience in recent years, the FPC said April 5 that not all of\nthem may be able to withstand unexpected shocks and maintain\nlending to companies and households.  The FPC discussed potential threats from the crisis in\nCyprus, which agreed on an international bailout last month.\nWhile at the time of the March 19 meeting there were \u201cminimal\nsigns\u201d of spillovers to other financial systems, there was \u201ca\nrisk that this situation could change,\u201d the committee said.  The panel, which was operating on an interim basis until\nthe start of last week, recommended that financial institutions\nlimit payouts such as bonuses and dividends. In their\ndiscussion, the FPC members noted the potential threats to the\nfinancial system from increased risk appetite among investors.  The FPC also said that banks\u2019 leverage ratios, a measure of\ntheir debt to equity level, would remain \u201cvery high\u201d even\nafter the new recommendations were met. It said there would be\n\u201clittle margin for error against a backdrop of low growth in\nthe advanced economies.\u201d  The committee, without naming any banks, said the\nPrudential Regulation Authority should take leverage ratios into\naccount when determining individual bank capital requirements.  EU\u2019s Semeta Says Austria in \u2018Lonely\u2019 Position on EU Savings Plan  Austria may find itself isolated if it continues to resist\nEuropean Union savings-tax proposals, EU Tax Commissioner\nAlgirdas Semeta said.  Semeta said Luxembourg is loosening its opposition to\nautomatic exchange of information, citing comments from that\nnation\u2019s Finance Minister Luc Frieden to Frankfurter Allgemeine\nZeitung. The tax chief said this \u201clong-overdue\u201d shift paves\nthe way to move ahead on the EU negotiations, which have been\nstalled since last year.  \u201cThe spotlight is now on Austria,\u201d Semeta said in a\nstatement. \u201cIf it continues to resist this inevitable progress\ntowards greater transparency, it will find itself in a lonely\nand quite unsustainable position.\u201d  Luxembourg and Austria last year vetoed negotiations over\nthe extension of a savings tax because of concerns that they\nwould be forced to give up banking secrecy measures that attract\nforeign depositors. The two countries blocked the European Union\nfrom starting talks on updating the seven-year-old tax accord\nwith Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra and San Marino.  U.K. Says Bonus Curbs It Fought Threaten Financial Stability  Banker bonus curbs backed by the rest of the European Union\nimperil efforts to make lenders more resilient in crises, the\nU.K. said in a new attack following Chancellor of the Exchequer\n George Osborne \u2019s defeated bid to block the measures.  The limits banning bonuses more than twice fixed pay \u201cwill\nbe damaging to financial stability and the soundness of affected\ncredit institutions\u201d and \u201care not consistent with\ninternationally agreed principles,\u201d the U.K. said in a\n statement  to the EU\u2019s Council of Ministers, published on the\nEU\u2019s website.  Britain also criticized the broader legislation containing\nthe pay rules, saying it may fail \u201cin certain significant\nareas\u201d to properly implement global standards agreed on by the\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision. The Basel group has\npromised to report on whether the final version of the EU rules\nclashes with an international accord known as Basel III.  The U.K., which lacks a veto on financial laws, was the\nsole dissenting voice opposing a deal struck between governments\nand EU lawmakers last month on how to apply the Basel rules --\nwhich more than triple the core reserves that banks must hold\nagainst possible losses. The European Parliament insisted on\nadding the pay curbs in a bid to stop excessive bonuses that it\nsaid spurred irresponsible risk taking.  For more, click here.

Comings and Goings/Executive Pay  Prudential Pays CEO $11.9 Million for 2012 After U.K. Reprimand  Prudential Plc (PRU) , the U.K.\u2019s biggest insurer by market value,\npaid Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam 7.8 million pounds\n($11.9 million) in 2012 even after he was reprimanded by the\nBritish regulator.  Thiam, 50, received a 1 million-pound salary, 2 million\npounds in bonus and 4.4 million pounds in long-term incentives\nfor performance periods ending in Dec. 31, 2012, London-based\nPrudential said April 5 in its annual report. The firm paid its\ndirectors 35.2 million pounds last year compared with 31.4\nmillion pounds in 2011, it said.  The Ivory Coast-born French national during the last week\nof March became the first serving CEO of a  FTSE 100 (UKX)  company to\nreceive a public reprimand from the U.K. regulator for not\ninforming it of the insurer\u2019s $35.5 billion bid for  AIA Group\nLtd.

Prudential\u2019s operating profit rose 25 percent to 2.53\nbillion pounds in 2012, beating analyst estimates, on higher\nearnings in Asian countries such as Indonesia, Singapore and\nMalaysia. Thiam raised the company\u2019s full-year dividend 16\npercent to 29.19 pence a share. That\u2019s 53 percent more than when\nhe joined the firm in 2009.
